                "description": "Avakaya pickles are usually made in the summer, this being the time for peak availability of green mangoes. Green mangoes, hot oil, chilies and a variety of spices are the key ingredients. The process of preparation, storage and serving is considered almost a ritual. The mangoes are cut into medium-sized pieces approximately 2cm x 2cm using strong and especially sharp cutters/knives in swift strokes so as not to structurally damage the pieces. These pieces are wiped clean and dry with a highly-absorbent soft cloth usually an old sterilized cotton sari with no embroidery, stowed away for this purpose. ...",

The main ingredients are mangoes, \u0101vapi\u1e47\u1e0di (powdered mustard seeds) and a combination of other spices used for pickling. South Indians are known to have a deep attachment to these spicy pickles. A wide variety of pickles are available in these regions, using mango as their prime ingredient. Besides being made at home, the pickles are available commercially and are exported to the United States, Europe, Japan and many other countries.\nAvakaya (Telugu version) is prepared during the pre-summer seasons when mangoes are just about to ripen. The Tamil version, is spicier then the Telugu version and sometimes contains chickpeas as one of the primary ingredients. It is prepared in many households and eaten along with curd rice.\nThere are a wide variety of mango pickles, these include:\n\u0100vak\u0101ya (The default one made with powdered mustard seed)\nAlla\u1e41 \u0100vak\u0101ya (A spicy variety including ginger-garlic paste)\nBella\u1e41 \u0100vak\u0101ya (A sweet variant of Avakaya made with jaggery)\nD\u014dsa \u0100vak\u0101ya (Mango replaced with a type of dosakaya) (bottle gourd)\nM\u0101g\u0101ya (Made with green, peeled, unstoned mango)\nMenti \u0100vak\u0101ya or Mentik\u0101ya (Includes fenugreek)\nNuvvulu \u0100vak\u0101ya (Includes sesame)\nPacca \u0100vak\u0101ya (Avakaya with yellow chillies rather than red ones which are usually used.)\nPulihora \u0100vak\u0101ya (Avakaya with t\u0101limpu (Telugu), called Chaunk in Hindi)\nSenagala \u0100vak\u0101ya (Avakaya with the addition of chickpeas or Bengal gram or chana)\nTokku M\u0101g\u0101ya (M\u0101g\u0101ya with the mango peel included)\nTarum M\u0101g\u0101ya (M\u0101g\u0101ya made with grated mango)\nUduku M\u0101g\u0101ya (M\u0101g\u0101ya with boiled rather than raw mango)\nUsiri \u0100vak\u0101ya (Mango replaced with gooseberry)\nVellu\u1e37\u1e37i \u0100vak\u0101ya (Avakaya with addition of garlic)\nYen\u1e0du \u0100vak\u0101ya (Avakaya with pickled, dried mango cubes mildly sweetened with jaggery)\nKobbari \u0100vak\u0101ya (Avakaya made with coconut flavor)\nHot rice is mixed with one or two pieces of avakaya and ghee (clarified butter) or groundnut oil, then made into bite-size balls.

Formerly, it was generally coated in beeswax to preserve it, as it still is in Greece and Egypt.

Bottarga is a delicacy of salted, cured fish roe, typically of the grey mullet or the bluefin tuna (bottarga di tonno). The best-known version is produced around the Mediterranean; similar foods are the Japanese karasumi and Taiwanese wuyutsu, which is softer, and Korean eoran, from mullet or freshwater drum. It has many names and is prepared in various ways.\nThe English name, bottarga, was borrowed from Italian. The Italian form is thought to have been introduced from the Arabic 'bu\u1e6dar\u1e2bah' (\u0628\u0637\u0627\u0631\u062e\u0629), plural form 'bu\u1e6dari\u1e2b' (\u0628\u0637\u0627\u0631\u062e), itself from Byzantine Greek '\u1fa0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd' ('oiot\u00e1rikhon'), a combination of the words '\u1fa0\u03cc\u03bd' ('egg') and '\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd' ('pickled').\nThe Italian form can be dated to c. 1500, as the Greek form of the word, when transliterated into Latin as 'ova tarycha', occurs in Bartolomeo Platina's De Honesta Voluptate (c. 1474), the earliest printed cookbook. In an Italian manuscript that \"closely parallels\" Platina's cookbook and dated to shortly after its publication, 'botarghe' is attested in the corresponding passage.\nThe first mention of the Greek form ('oiot\u00e1rikhon') occurs in the 11th century, in the writings of Simeon Seth, who denounced the food as something to be \"avoided totally\", although a similar phrase may have been in use since antiquity in the same denotation.\nIt has been suggested that the Coptic outarakhon may be an intermediate form between the Greek and Arabic, whereas examination of dialectical variants of the Greek '\u1fa0\u03cc\u03bd' 'egg' include the Pontic Greek '\u1f60\u03b2\u03cc\u03bd' (traditionally where the mullets are caught), and '\u1f40\u03b2\u03cc' or '\u03b2\u03cc' in parts of Asia Minor. The modern Greek name comes from the Byzantine Greek, substituting the modern word '\u03b1\u03c5\u03b3\u03cc' for the ancient word '\u1fa0\u00f3\u03bd'.\nBottarga production is first documented in the Nile Delta in the 10th century BCE.\nIn the 15th century, Martino da Como describes the production of bottarga by salting then smoking to dry it.\n\nIn Croatia, the delicacy is known as butarga or butarda. It is usually fried before serving.\nOrange and molded in wax, Tunisian boutarga is made from mullet eggs and is known as a sought-after product.\nBottarga is produced in the Port Said area. It is commonly pronounced Batarekh all over Egypt.\nThe usual French name is boutargue; in Provence, it is called poutargue and is produced in the city of Martigues.\nIn Greece, it is called avgotaraxo or avgotaracho (Greek: \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf-\u03b1\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf) and is produced primarily from the flathead mullet caught in Greek lagoons. The whole mature ovaries are removed from the fish, washed with water, salted with natural sea salt, dried under the sun, and sealed in melted beeswax.\nAvgotaracho Messolonghiou, made from fish caught in the Messolonghi-Etoliko Lagoons, is a European and Greek protected designation of origin, one of the few seafood products with a PDO.\nIn Italy, it is made from bluefin tuna in Sicily, and from flathead mullet in Sardinia, where it is called Sardinian  but\u00e0riga.\nIts culinary properties may be compared to those of dry anchovies, although it is much more expensive. Often, it is served with olive oil or lemon juice as an appetizer accompanied by bread or crostini. It is also used in pasta dishes.\nBottarga is categorized as a traditional food product (prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale).\nBottarga is produced in Mauritania and Senegal.\nIn Turkey, bottarga is made from grey mullet roe. It is listed in the Ark of Taste. It is produced in Dalyan, on the southwestern coast of Turkey, from the mature fish migrating from Lake K\u00f6yce\u011fiz.\nBottarga in Spain is produced and consumed mainly in the country's southeastern region, in the Autonomous Community of Murcia and the province of Alicante. It is usually made from a variety of roes including, among others, grey mullet, tuna, bonito, or even black drum or common ling (the latter two somewhat cheaper and less valued). Much of its production is centered around the town of San Pedro del Pinatar, to the shores of the Mar Menor, where there are also salt ponds.\nThere are several producers in Florida. The Manatee county tourist bureau states that the process of making bottarga was depicted in Ancient Egyptian murals and that documentation from the 1500s exists that the Native Americans along the western coast of Florida were consuming dried mullet roe when encountered by European explorers.\nThere are various small producers elsewhere. For example, bottarga from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is produced in northern Norway, where it is air-dried.\n\"botargo\". Oxford English Dictionary (Online\u00a0ed.).

Additional amount of water can be added based on the thickness of the batter and then salt is added for taste. Finally the batter is used to prepare the dosa.",

Neer dosa, literally meaning water dosa in both Tulu and Malayalam, and also known as Ari Dosa in Malayalam, is a cr\u00eape prepared from rice batter. Neer dosa is a delicacy from Tulu Nadu and Malabar regions, and part of Udupi - Mangalorean and Malabar cuisines.\nNeer is the word for water in Tulu and Malayalam languages.\nUnlike other dosas neer dosa is known for its simple preparation method and lack of fermentation. Usually neer dosa is served with coconut chutney, sambar, saagu and non vegetarian curries like chicken, mutton, fish and egg curry.\nEven though many variations exist for Neer Dosa batter, the two basic ingredients common to all of them are just soaked rice (or rice flour) and salt.\nList of Indian breads\nS, Latha Maheswari (3 October 2015).

The batter is poured into large square or rectangular molds, baked in an oven and cut into long rectangular shapes. Since the recipe calls for mizuame, a type of sugar syrup, Castella has a moist texture. Now a specialty of Nagasaki, the cake was brought to Japan by Portuguese merchants in the 16th century. The name is derived from Portuguese Po de Castela, meaning \"bread from Castile\". Castella cake is usually sold in long boxes, with the cake inside being approximately 27cm long. ...",

In the 16th century, the Portuguese reached Japan and soon started trade and missionary work. Nagasaki was then the only Japanese port open for foreign commerce. The Portuguese introduced many then-unusual things, such as guns, tobacco, and pumpkins. The cake could be stored for a long time, and so was useful for the sailors who were out on the sea for months. In the Edo period, in part due to the cost of sugar, castella was an expensive dessert to make despite the ingredients sold by the Portuguese. When the Emperor of Japan's envoy was invited, the Tokugawa shogunate presented the Castella. Over the years, the taste changed to suit Japanese palates.\nThere are now many varieties made with ingredients such as powdered green tea, brown sugar, and honey. They may be molded in various shapes; a popular Japanese festival food is baby castella, a bite-sized version.\nSiberia, castella cake filled with youkan (sweet bean jelly), was popular in the Meiji era; it had a resurgence since it appeared in the  2013 animated film The Wind Rises, by Hayao Miyazaki.\nCastella mix is used for the pancakes that are sandwiched together with sweet adzuki bean paste in the confection known as dorayaki.\nCastella were first introduced to Taiwan during the age of Taiwan under Japanese rule. In 1968, Ye Yongqing, the owner of a Japanese bakery in Taipei named Nanbanto, partnered with the Japanese company Nagasaki Honpu to establish a castella business. \nTaiwanese style castella is generally more souffl\u00e9-like than the Japanese variety with a custard like center. A speciality of Tamsui is a simple pillow shaped castella cake. Taiwanese style castella has been introduced into Japan.\nGairaigo\nJapanese words of Portuguese origin\nChen, Namiko (2013-09-14). \"Castella Cake (Video) \u30ab\u30b9\u30c6\u30e9\".

Instead of using chemical leavening, air is suspended in the batter during mixing to provide volume.

Genoise is a basic building block of much French p\u00e2tisserie and is used for making several different types of cake. The batter usually is baked to form a thin sheet.  An 1884 cookbook gives a simple recipe for a genoise:\nWork together briskly in a basin half a pound of flour, half a pound of sugar, and four eggs:  after five minutes' good stirring, add a quarter of a pound of melted butter.  Butter a square baking sheet, spread the paste upon it, and bake it in a moderate oven until it turns a golden yellow.\nWhen finished baking, the sheet is rolled while still warm (to make jelly rolls or b\u00fbches de No\u00ebl), or cut and stacked into multiple layers or line a mold to be filled with a frozen dessert.  A variety of fillings are used, such as jelly, chocolate, fruit, pastry cream, and whipped cream.  The genoise can be piped in strips to make ladyfingers or into molds to make madeleines. It is the base for Jaffa Cakes.\nThe cake is notable for its elastic and somewhat dry texture and is sometimes soaked with flavored syrups or liqueurs and often served with a buttercream frosting. The popular tiramisu cake may be made with ladyfingers or a genoise sheet.\nA chocolate genoise can be made by substituting cocoa powder for some of the flour, and is sometimes used as a substitute for the richer cake used in the standard Sacher torte recipe.\nCastella\nGenoa cake\nLamington\nZuppa Inglese\nG\u00e2teau magique\nCuisine of Liguria\nList of Italian dishes\n\"genoise\".

                "description": "Sate lilit  (Aksara Bali: ) is a satay variant in Indonesia, originating from Balinese cuisine. This satay is made from minced pork, fish, chicken, beef, or even turtle meat, which is then mixed with grated coconut, thick coconut milk, lemon juice, shallots, and pepper. The spiced minced meat is wound around bamboo, sugar cane or lemongrass sticks, it is then grilled on charcoal. Unlike skewers of other satay recipes which is made narrow and sharp, the bamboo skewer of sate lilit is flat and wide. This wider surface allowed the minced meat to stick and settle. The term lilit in Balinese and Indonesian means \"to wrap around\", which corresponds to its making method to wrapping around instead of skewering the meat.",

As a Hindu majority island, the Balinese authentic version prefer pork and fish over other meat, and beef is originally seldom consumed in Bali. However to cater larger consumer that do not consume pork, such as Indonesian Muslim majority, in Balinese restaurant outside of Bali sate lilit often used chicken or beef instead. In Balinese fishing towns, such as the village of Kusamba, which faces the Nusa Penida Strait, sate lilit made from minced fish is favoured.\nTwo of the favorite satay in Bali are sate lilit, and sate ikan (fish satay). Although there are fish sate lilit made with minced fish, sate ikan is using chunk of fish meat instead. The authentic Balinese sate lilit and sate ikan are rich in bumbu, a mixture of spices and herbs. In Bali, almost every dish is flavored with bumbu megenep \u2014 a mix of spices and herbs ranging from lime leaves, to coconut milk, garlic, shallots, blue galangal, coriander, lesser galangal, turmeric and chili pepper.\n\n\nO\u2019Gilvie, Diana (14 October 2012). \"Learning Bali's true flavors\".

The Chinese chicken salad that is popular in the US seems to be a product of pan-Asian cuisine or fusion cuisine influences, rather than having roots in Chinese cuisine. Reasoning for that theory is that green lettuce salad is a dish of primarily Western origins.\nMany non-Western world cultures also have salads of various sorts as part of their traditional cuisines. In Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads, Sylvia Lovegren writes, \"There are many different types of cold chicken salad in China, although most of them seem to originate in Szechwan. But the Chinese chicken salad being consumed ... by the fashionable set, probably originated in California.\" In Hollywood Dish, Akasha Richmond writes, \"Hollywood gave rise to more salads than just the Caesar and Cobb. The 1960s produced the Chinese Chicken Salad, which was made popular at Madame Wu's in Santa Monica. Cary Grant asked her to put it on the menu after eating it at another restaurant.\"\nAccording to a website about Sylvia Cheng Wu, who is popularly known by her alias Madame Wu, \"She came up with something better, using a recipe she vaguely remembered having encountered in Shanghai. It was a blend of shredded chicken, fried vermicelli, green onions and toasted almonds. Madame Wu\u2019s soon became known for her Chinese chicken salad, now an American luncheon classic.\"  But, the popularity of Chinese Chicken salad was not necessarily mainstream yet, although perhaps intimated and attempted throughout the years and generations.\nIn the United States, many common cookbooks from circa 1900 to the 1950s would include chicken salad; but, for many of them, that would often presume a bound salad with chopped vegetables and mayonnaise, typically without lettuce.  For example,  The Settlement Cookbook by Mrs. Simon Kander, published as early as 1910, includes a simple \"Lettuce salad\" with chopped onion and French or German dressing; but, no Chinese, Asian or Oriental salad of any kind.  Similar bound chicken salads were found in Joy of Cooking as of the 1974 editions (first published as of 1931).  It was by 1950s that main course type salads started to appear in books like Better Homes & Gardens, New Cook Book; whereas, that often included Caesar salad along with the usual bound chicken salad, but no Asian-styled or -flavored salads.  The Good Housekeeping Cookbook introduced a \"Sesame-Spinach Salad,\" with soy sauce and salad oil, although not with sesame oil; whereas, this introduced something closer to Asian flavors, such as comparatively to what also included a few curry salads and still others that were similar to Better Homes. The next generation of ever more exotic and main course salads were on the way.\nWith intimations of Asian-style lettuce salads appearing by the 1950s and into the 1970s, publishers like California's Sunset Magazine stated in their popular cookbooks and guides that \"You'll find such classics as Caesar, Waldorf, and Crab Louis; international favorites with exotic names like Tabbuli and Antipasto; satisfying whole-meal salads like Shrimp-stuffed Avocados and Taco Salad...\" and so on. Suddenly, sesame seeds went from just being a garnish on a salad, to being an ingredient for a recipe of \"Sesame Seed Dressing\" (p.\u00a06); but, more over, and indeed, there was now a recipe for \"Chinese Chicken Salad\" (p.\u00a035).\nSunset's recipe for Chinese Chicken appeared similarly as to what it's known as today, including: soy sauce; salad oil; garlic and ginger; (relatively exotic) Chinese five-spice or (more common substitute, ground cinnamon); broiler fryer chicken (marinated in sherry wine); sesame seed; shredded iceberg lettuce; green onions; coriander (cilantro); cashews or peanuts; and lemon dressing.  It was noted therein, that \"Many variations of this salad vie for popularity.  This one, without traditional crisp noodles, is simpler than most...\" since, fried vermicelli noodles is probably difficult to find and make for many homemakers. Most of these recipes had not yet included sesame oil, seemingly still rare to find for most homemakers.\nBeyond that, perhaps reflecting the California lifestyle and its eventual approach to the newer California Cuisine that used fresh ingredients and contemporary, multicultural flare, Sunset also now provided countless other Asian salad recipes, seeming to recognize the new trend and desire: Oriental Cabbage Slaw (p.\u00a024); Oriental Wilted Romaine Salad (p.\u00a025); Chicken in Cantaloupe with Curry Dressing (no lettuce) (p.\u00a033); Hoisin Chicken Salad (p.\u00a036); Oriental Turkey Salad (p.\u00a037); and so on. The new Chinese and other Asian salads were added with a broad arrangement of other main salads, although perhaps not authentic, they were nevertheless styled and inspired by exotic cuisines and ingredients.

Because of its many elements, the result has speckled bits of interior color against a colored gelatin background, and so the dish can be appreciated for its colorful visual appeal.

The origins of jello salad can be traced back to a dish called perfection salad (c. 1904) by Mrs. John E. Cook of New Castle, Pennsylvania, which won third prize in a Better Homes and Gardens recipe contest.\nJello salads are a common feature of US communal meals such as potlucks, most probably because they are inexpensive and easy to prepare. The salad has a strong regional presence in Utah and surrounding states (the Mormon Corridor), especially among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In Utah, where Jell-O is the official state snack, jello salad is commonly available in local restaurants such as Chuck-A-Rama. In Canada, a traditional Newfoundland cold plate commonly includes a variation on jello salad, though more commonly known as a 'jelly' salad.\nAspic, a savory gelatin dish\nSeafoam salad, a type of jello salad\nFrogeye salad, a sweet pasta salad\nWatergate salad, dessert salad with pistachio pudding\nAmbrosia salad, a fruit salad\n\"Lime Jello Marshmallow Cottage Cheese Surprise\", a humorous song about a specific type of gelatin salad (1980)\nPolis, Carey (18 September 2012). \"The State Of Jell-O Salad In America\".

Tapenade ([tap\u0259\u02c8nad]; Occitan: tapenada [tape\u02c8nad\u0254]) is a Proven\u00e7al name for a spread, condiment and culinary ingredient consisting of pur\u00e9ed or finely chopped olives, capers, and anchovies. Its name comes from the Proven\u00e7al word for capers, tapenas ([ta\u02c8pen\u0254s]). It is a popular food in the south of France, where it is generally eaten as an hors d'\u0153uvre spread on bread, and sometimes used to stuff poultry for a main course.\nOlive-based dishes with anchovies or vinegar are ubiquitous in Italian cuisine, documented in ancient Roman cookbooks dating back more than a thousand years before the appearance of the Occitan word tapenade. One of the earliest known of such Italian recipes, Olivarum conditurae, appears in Columella's De re Rustica written in the first century AD. Cato the Elder (234\u2013149 B.C.) also includes a recipe for epityrum, an olive spread very much like a tapenade, in chapter 119 of his On Agriculture. The use of capers is the hallmark of recipes for tapenade.\nSometimes tapenade is confused with New Orleans olive salad, a critical component in the New Orleans sandwich the muffaletta. New Orleans olive salad is more properly called a giardiniera. It also does not contain capers, but does contain cauliflower, carrots, and celery.\nTapenade may be used as part of an appetizer served as a topping on crusty bread or crudit\u00e9s. It may also be used as a condiment and in preparing fish dishes.\nRelish\nList of spreads\nMediterranean cuisine\nWright, Clifford A. \"What is Tapenade?\". What is Tapenade?. Clifford A Wright.

Hallaca ([a\u02c8\u028eaka], [a\u02c8\u029daka]; alt. spelling, hayaca and ayaca) is a tamal from Venezuela. It consists of corn dough stuffed with a stew of beef, pork, or chicken and other ingredients such as  raisins, capers, and olives. Hallacas are folded in plantain leaves, tied with strings, and boiled; The dish is traditionally served during the Christmas season and has several regional variants in Venezuela.  It has been described as a national dish of Venezuela but it can be found also in variants. Some speculate it originated from the Orinoquia. A characteristic of the hallaca is the delicate corn dough made with consomm\u00e9 or broth and lard colored with annatto. Hallacas are also commonly consumed in eastern Cuba, Trinidad where it is referred to as pastelle, as well as parts of Colombia, Ecuador, Aruba, and Cura\u00e7ao. In Nicaragua it is known as \u201cNacatamal\u201d.\nHallaca is a Mesoamerican tamal-like dish that goes by various names and spread throughout the Spanish kingdoms in the Americas as far south as Argentina in the decades following the conquest. It is said to have been invented by slaves during the colonial era. The slaves would prepare the Christmas Eve meal for the landowners and with leftover meat they made the hallacas filling for their own Christmas meal. One version of the dishes origin tale has it that the daughter of the landowning family asked to taste the hallacas. She and her family liked the dish so much they requested for it to be made for their dinner party and ever since it has been part of the traditional holiday meal for all economic classes.\nAccording to Adolfo Ernst, the word hallaca evolved from the indigenous Guarani language, stemming from the verb ayua or ayuar, meaning \"to mix or blend\". From there, the construction ayuaca (mixed things) devolved to ayaca and ultimately to hayaca or hallaca (using Spanish silent \"h\" when written).  Another version presumes that the word comes from an aboriginal language of the West of the country, whose meaning is \"wrapping\" or \"bojote\". The earliest use of the word in the modern sense is in a 1781 document of Italian missionary linguist Filippo Salvatore Gilii.\nHallaca is a staple of Venezuelan Christmas celebrations Christmas meals in Venezuela would include hallacas, pastries, pan de jam\u00f3n and chicken stew, but not all families have been able to afford them during food shortages in Venezuela. In 2014, despite food shortages affecting the country, the Venezuelan government created a hallaca with a length of around 400 feet, a Guinness World Record. In contrast to Venezuelan tradition, hallacas are popular year-round in Ecuador, and several variants exist across the country's different regions. Along with humitas, they are a staple of traditional Ecuadorian cuisine.\nFamilies usually gather in the morning to prep the ingredients.

Sayur lodeh is an Indonesian vegetable soup prepared from vegetables in coconut milk popular in Indonesia, but most often associated with Javanese cuisine.\nThe origin of the dish can be traced to the Javanese people's tradition of Java. According to Javanese Kejawen beliefs, sayur lodeh is an essential part of the slametan ceremony and it is believed as tolak bala, to ward off possible danger and disaster. The people and the Keraton (court) of Yogyakarta often communally cook sayur lodeh for the slametan ceremony. It is believed this can deter disasters such as wind storm, earthquake, volcanic eruption, drought and plague. It is well known in Javanese cuisine and has spread throughout Indonesia and the region. Because of Javanese migration to neighboring countries, today sayur lodeh is also popular in Malaysia and Singapore.\nSayur lodeh can be served with steamed rice (separated or mixed in one plate), or with sliced lontong rice cake. Although sayur lodeh basically is a vegetarian dish, it is popularly consumed with ikan asin (salted fish), opor ayam, empal gepuk or beef serundeng. Sambal terasi (\"shrimp paste chili sauce\") is usually served separately.\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, when sayur lodeh is served with lontong (nasi himpit), it is known as lontong.

Ka'\u00ed Ladrillo is a typical dessert of the Paraguayan cuisine prepared mainly with peanuts and molasses.\nThe name ka\u2019i ladrillo is the result of the combination of two words, \u201cka\u2019i\u201d that means \u201cmonkey\u201d and \u201cladrillo\u201d that is brick, used to refer to all things with that shape. So the \u201cka\u2019i ladrillo\u201d is the \u201cbrick of the monkey\u201d because it is usually made with a rectangular form like a brick and because the monkey (ka\u2019i mirikina) is an animal natural of the Paraguayan jungles that likes to eat everything that is sweet. And this dessert is especially sweet. It is also called \u201cazukap\u00e9 manduv\u00ed\u201d, Guaran\u00ed words for \u201csugar\u201d (azuk\u00e1), \u201cflat\u201d (p\u00e9) and \u201cpeanut\u201d (manduv\u00ed).\nTo prepare the ka\u2019i ladrillo are needed: toast peanuts and molasses. Some varieties of the dish also include a little of sour orange or grapefruit juice, which give it a bittersweet taste and diminishes the excessive sweetness.\nCarlos Villagra Marsal (1999).

Tembleque is a coconut dessert pudding from Puerto Rico. It is one of the most popular desserts in Puerto Rican cuisine.\nIt is a holiday dish, served on New Year's Day throughout the island of Puerto Rico. While the recipe may have originated in Puerto Rico, there are variants on the dish in Latin America and other countries. In Brazil, the dish is known as manjar branco. According to the Encyclopedia of Puerto Rico, published by the Foundation for the Humanities, each time a Puerto Rican migrant to the United States comes closer and closer to forgetting their roots, foods like tembleque bring them back and remind them who they are, reminds them of their island and of their grandmother.\nIn Spanish, the word tembleque is an adjective used to describe something that shakes or a noun, to describe the shakes themselves. The dessert,  due to its Jell-O-like, gel texture trembles, shivers, shakes, and that is what the finished dessert does, when prepared correctly.\nTembleque, a reggaeton song by Jon Erik, describing the movement of tembleque, the dessert, and tembleque, the dance move\nCoconut bar\nKhanom thuai\nBebinca\nHaupia\n\"Puerto Rican Coconut Pudding\".

The flour used in parkin in England is self-raising, containing a small amount of chemical leavening agent.

Parkin is a gingerbread cake traditionally made with oatmeal and black treacle, which originated in northern England. Often associated with Yorkshire.  it is very widespread and popular elsewhere, notably in Lancashire. Parkin is baked to a hard cake but with resting becomes moist and even sometimes sticky. In Hull and East Yorkshire, it has a drier, more biscuit-like texture than in other areas. Parkin is traditionally eaten on Guy Fawkes Night, 5 November,  but is also enjoyed throughout the winter months. It is baked commercially throughout Yorkshire, but is mainly a domestic product in other areas.\nThe origin of the word parkin is unknown. The first published dated reference to parkin was collected from 1728 from the West Yorkshire Quarter Sessions when Anne Whittaker was accused of stealing oatmeal to make parkin. The Lancashire schoolmaster and poet Tim Bobbin describes tharf cake in 1740, and this is recognisable as a parkin. A possible older use of parkin is in the seventeenth century ballad  'The song of Arthur O'Bradley'  that purports to describe a merry wedding from the time of Robin Hood (fourteenth century)\nWhen Arthur, to make their hearts merry\n\nBrought ales and parkin and perry.\nThe tharf cake is of ancient Teutonic origin, as tharf or theorf meant 'unleavened, un-fermented, solid tough or sodden' in Old English. John Wycliffe in his translation of the Bible in 1389 (Mark Ch.14.v. 1) calls unleavened bread a \"tharf loove\"\nParkin is virtually unknown in the south of England. It is eaten in an area where oats were the staple grain for the poor, rather than wheat. It is closely related to tharf cake \u2013 an unsweetened cake cooked on a griddle rather than baked. The traditional time of the year for tharf cakes to be made  was directly after the oat harvest in the first week in November. For festive occasions, the cake would be sweetened with honey. In the seventeenth century (about 1650) sugar started to be imported from Barbados, and molasses was a by-product of the refining process. Molasses was first used by apothecaries; to make a medicine theriaca, from which name the word treacle is derived. As molasses became plentiful, or treacle as it became called at that time, it was substituted for honey in the preparation of tharf cakes.\nIn Northern Europe honey was used as a medicine, for festive cakes and making mead; before 1750 sweetness was not a characteristic of everyday food. Honey cakes had a special festive significance. They were baked to be hard, but after storage for a couple of weeks they regained their moisture becoming soft and even sticky. Molasses has hygroscopic properties. German Lebkuchen and Pfefferkuchen were other examples of hygroscopic holiday ginger-breads. They too were baked hard in summer and allowed to moisten for consumption at Christmas.\nThough parkin and tharf cake appear to be synonymous, all parkins generally were sweet tharf cakes.\nParkin and tharf cake were used interchangeably in Lancashire and South Yorkshire until 1900. Over the 500 years the recipe and taste of these cakes have changed considerably.  It was the food of the poor. Ovens were rare in the houses of the poor, and they generally had no access to public bakers before the 1820s, so the cakes were cooked on griddles or bakestones on an open fire. The best parkin was made with fresh oatmeal, which fixes the date around the first week in November.\nIn southern Lancashire and West Yorkshire, parkin is inextricably linked to the Guy Fawkes Night celebration. Jennifer Stead, in her study Prodigal Frugality, identifies the link between Guy Fawkes and parkin as the bonfire. The first two weeks in November had many Christian festivals, and like Celtic festivals that preceded them they were celebrated with a fire and ritual cakes. November starts with All Hallows Eve, that runs into All Saints Day (1 November), which is followed by All Souls Day (2 November).  Little Lent and the forty-day fast until Christmas, started at Martinmas. (11 November). On All Souls Day soul cakes were baked. The Martinmas fair was important being the traditional day when cattle were bought and sold, and servants were hired for the following year. It was also the date that cattle were slaughtered and salted to preserve them for the winter and for general feasting and dancing.\nThe Celtic festival of Samain, the festival of the dead on 1 November, was celebrated with special cakes and bonfires. It was Christianised into All Hallows by the church in 837 A.D., and the culinary tradition continued. When Guy Fawkes in 1605 gave the English church a reason to celebrate with a bonfire, the tradition was adopted under the new name, just four days later on 5 November.

Mashed carrots is a dish prepared by cooking and then mashing carrots. Milk, butter, salt and pepper are commonly mixed in after the carrots are mashed.  Carrots can also be roasted in the oven before mashing. Other mashed vegetables may be added to the mashed carrots. These include onions, parsnips, turnips, squash, and rutabaga. Mashed potatoes may be mashed along with mashed carrots.\nTo create mashed carrots, the carrots are prepared and cut into a uniform size and boiled, steamed or roasted. The cooked carrots then can be mashed in a food processor or by hand with a potato masher. In addition, canned carrots can be used to prepare mashed carrots. Mashed carrots are served hot.\nMashed carrots may be served as a side dish. They are a major ingredient in carrot muffins, carrot cookies and carrot souffle.

Brioche has numerous uses in cuisine and can take on various forms, served plain or filled, as coulibiac, or with many other different savory fillings, such as fillet of beef en croute, foie gras, sausage, cervelat lyonnais. Brioche can also be served with sweet fillings, especially fresh fruits, vanilla cream or jam.\nBrioche \u00e0 t\u00eate  or parisienne is perhaps the most classically recognized form: it is formed and baked in a fluted round, flared tin; a large ball of dough is placed on the bottom and topped with a smaller ball of dough to form the head (t\u00eate). Brioche Nanterre is a loaf of brioche made in a standard loaf pan. Instead of shaping two pieces of dough and baking them together, two rows of small pieces of dough are placed in the pan. Loaves are then proofed (allowed to rise) in the pan, fusing the pieces together. During the baking process the balls of dough rise further and form an attractive pattern.\nBrioche can also be made in a pan without being rolled into balls to make an ordinary loaf.\nBrioche dough contains flour, eggs, butter, liquid (milk, water, cream, and sometimes brandy), leavening (yeast or sourdough), salt, and sometimes sugar. Common recipes have a flour to butter ratio of about 2:1.\nThe normal method of preparation is to make the dough, let it rise to double its volume at room temperature and then punch it down and let it rise again in the refrigerator for varying periods (according to the recipe), retarding the dough to develop the flavor. Refrigeration also stiffens the dough, which still rises, albeit slowly, making it easier to form. The dough is then shaped, placed in containers for the final proofing, and generally brushed on top with an egg wash before being baked at 230\u00a0\u00b0C (446\u00a0\u00b0F) until the crust browns and the interior reaches at least 90\u00a0\u00b0C (194\u00a0\u00b0F). The first rise time for small rolls is 1 to 1\u00bd hours, for larger brioche the time is lengthened until the loaves double.\nThe first recorded use of the word in French dates from 1404. It is attested in 1611 in Cotgrave's A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues, where it is described as \"a rowle, or bunne, of spiced bread\" and its origin given as Norman.\nIn France it developed as \"a sort of bread improved since antiquity by generations of bakers, then of pastry-makers ... with some butter, some eggs, sugar coming later ... it developed from the blessed bread [pain b\u00e9nit] of the church which gradually became of better quality, more and more costly, less and less bread; until becoming savory brioche\". In the 17th century \"p\u00e2t\u00e9 \u00e0 tarte brioch\u00e9e\", \"a pain \u00e0 brioche pauvre [poor] ... [using only] 3 eggs and 250 grams of butter for 1 kilogram of flour\" was introduced. The terms \"pain b\u00e9nit\" and \"brioche\" were sometimes used together or virtually interchangeably; so, for example, in another 17th-century recipe entitled: \"CHAPITRE II. Pain b\u00e9nit, & brioches.\" It begins with a lighter, cheaper version of blessed bread, calling for \"a pound of fresh butter and a soft cheese [but no eggs!] for a pail of flour\"; and goes on to describe \"the more delicate that we call Cousin\", which uses 3 pounds of butter, 2 cheeses, and a royal pint of eggs for the same amount of flour, as well as \"some good milk\" if \"the dough is too firm\". However, sourdough and brewer's yeast preparations would both remain common well into the next century, with \"blessed bread ... more and more often replaced by brioche\" in the 18th century, where \"Those from Gisors and Gournay, great butter markets, were the most highly regarded.\"\nFor the wealthy \"from the time of Louis XIV onwards ... Butter, in widespread use at least in the northern half of France, was the secret of making brioches\". \"In Gisors, on market days, they produce up to 250 or 300\u00a0kg of brioches. The dough is made the evening before (1\u00a0kg of farine, a quarter of which for the starter, 10\u00a0g of yeast, 7 or 8 eggs; one mixes this together with the starter and 800\u00a0g of butter, breaking up the dough, which 'uses up the butter'). The dough is kept in a terrine, and one puts it in a mold just at the moment of baking. Thus prepared, the brioche remains light, keeps well, maintains the flavour of butter, without the stench of the starter.\" Brioche of varying degrees of richness from the rich man's with a flour to butter ratio of 3:2 to the cheaper pain brioch\u00e9 with a ratio of 4:1 existed at the same time.\nJean-Jacques Rousseau, in his autobiography Confessions, relates that \"a great princess\" is said to have advised, with regard to peasants who had no bread, \"Qu'ils mangent de la brioche\", commonly translated as  \"Let them eat cake\". This saying is commonly misattributed to Queen Marie-Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI.\nAlthough there has been much debate about the etymology of the word and,",

The origin of the term \"monkey bread\" comes from the pastry being a finger food; the consumer would pick apart the bread as a monkey would.\nOther names for the bread include Christmas morning delights, monkey puzzle bread, monkey brains, sticky bread, Hungarian coffee cake, golden dumpling coffee cake, pinch-me cake, pluck-it cake, plucking cake,  bubble loaf and funky bread.\nWhat most people know as monkey bread today in the United States is actually the Hungarian dessert arany galuska (\"golden dumpling\"). Dating back to the 1880s in Hungarian literature, Hungarian immigrants brought this dish with them when they immigrated to America and began introducing it into the country's food landscape when Hungarian and Hungarian Jewish bakeries began selling it in the mid-twentieth century.\nIn 1972, a cookbook published by Betty Crocker included a recipe for arany galuska, which they referred to as \"Hungarian Coffee Cake\". As it became more popular in America, arany galuska came to be confused with monkey bread in which the balls of dough are not dipped in cinnamon and sugar but only in butter. \"Monkey bread\" soon became the more common name for this Hungarian Jewish dessert.\nRecipes for the bread first appeared in American women's magazines and community cookbooks in the 1950s, but the dish is still virtually unknown outside the United States. \nDuring the 1980s, Nancy Reagan popularized serving monkey bread during Christmas by making it a staple of the Reagan White House Christmas.\nThe bread is made with pieces of sweet yeast dough (often frozen), which are baked in a cake pan at high heat after first being individually covered in melted butter, cinnamon, sugar, and chopped pecans.  It is traditionally served hot so that the baked segments can be easily torn away with the fingers and eaten by hand.\nArany galuska\nList of buns\nList of pastries\n\"Monkey bread recipe\". taste.com.au. 7 July 2015.\nOlver, Lynne. \"The Food Timeline: history notes\".

A splash of white wine can be added too. The word \"tartiflette\" is probably derived from the Arpitan word for \"potato\" (tartifl) or from the Savoyard tartifles, a term also found in Provenal. This modern recipe was inspired by a traditional dish called pla: a gratin cooked in a long-handled pan called a pelagic (shovel). Often served as an aprs-ski meal, tartiflette conveys an image of Alpine authenticity and conviviality.",

As with many traditional dishes in the region, the potato is a staple ingredient. Savoy was historically part of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Savoyards were exposed to potato tubers earlier than the French. Tartiflette was first mentioned in a 1705 book, Le Cuisinier Royal et Bourgeois, written by Fran\u00e7ois Massialot and his assistant cook B. Mathieu.\nIn its modern form, tartiflette began to appear on the menus of restaurants in the ski resorts in the 1980s. Its popularity is partly thanks to the promotional effort by Le Syndicat Interprofessionnel du Reblochon to boost the sales of reblochon, as is confirmed also by Christian Millau (of the Gault-Millau Guide) in his gastronomic dictionary.\nA common related dish found throughout the region is the croziflette. Its preparation resembles that of the original dish in everything but the use of potatoes, in place of which minuscule squares of locally produced pasta are used. These are known as crozets de Savoie (which are usually made from buckwheat, but sometimes durum), hence the name of this dish, which is a blend of \"crozet\" and \"tartiflette\".\nAnother related dish is the morbiflette prepared with the Morbier cheese in place of the Reblochon.\nWillan, Anne (2007). \"Tartiflette: Potato and Reblochon Cheese Melt\".

                "description": "Nata de coco, also marketed as coconut gel, is a chewy, translucent, jelly-like food produced by the fermentation of coconut water, which gels through the production of microbial cellulose by Komagataeibacter xylinus. Originating in the Philippines, nata de coco was  invented in 1949 by Tedula Kalaw frica as an alternative to the traditional Filipino nata de pia made from pineapples. It is most commonly sweetened as a candy or dessert, and can accompany a variety of foods, including pickles, drinks, ice cream, puddings, and fruit cocktails.",

Nata de coco is the Spanish term for \"cream of coconut\" or \"Coconut Cream\".\nNata de coco was invented in 1949 by Te\u00f3dula Kalaw \u00c1frica, a Filipina chemist working for the National Coconut Corporation (now the Philippine Coconut Authority). It was originally conceived as an alternative to nata de pi\u00f1a, another gel-like Filipino dessert produced since the 18th century. This was because though the demand was high, nata de pi\u00f1a was seasonal, as it relied on pineapple harvests from the declining pi\u00f1a fibre industry.\nCommercial production of nata de coco began in 1954, when the agency, renamed the Philippine Coconut Administration, opened a branch in Alaminos, Laguna and introduced the technology to local farmers. Nata de coco production was later optimized in the mid-1970s through the efforts of a team of microbiologists led by Priscilla C. S\u00e1nchez. In the 20th century, the demand for coconuts increased. Products from coconuts became a major export product of the Philippines, including nata de coco.\nNata de coco is mainly made from coconut water, so it has a modest nutritional profile. One cup of it (118 grams) contains 109 calories, 1 gram of protein, and 7 grams of carbohydrates. It is often characterized as healthful since it contains dietary fiber to aid digestion while carrying fewer calories compared to other desserts, gram for gram.\nCommercially made nata de coco is made by small farms in the Philippines, especially in Laguna and Quezon, as well as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia, especially in Yogyakarta. It is commonly sold in jars.\nThe primarily coconut water dessert is produced through the following steps:\nExtraction of the coconut water,\nFermentation of the coconut water with bacterial cultures,\nSeparation and cutting of the produced surface layer of nata de coco,\nCleaning and washing off the acetic acid,\nCutting and packaging\nNata de coco can be consumed on its own, but it can be used as an ingredient as well for fruit salads, halo-halo, coconut cakes, ice creams, soft drinks, bubble tea, and yoghurts.\nMacapuno\nCoconut sprout\nSanchez, P.C.

It is believed that offering alcohol would satisfy the Tantric gods who in turn grant followers good luck. Aila is first offered to the gods before every religious festival and cultural activities, and then it is served. One such famous Newari festival is Yenya.\nPatan, Nepal\nKathmandu Valley\nNepal Bhasa\nNewa cuisine\nYenya\n\"Aila:(Nepal) Made from Rice\". February 14, 2012.

Manjar blanco in Spain and in other parts of Europe refers to a dessert (blancmange in English), traditionally light brown in color (although often colored by added ingredients), made with a mould with a consistency like gelatin (in fact modern varieties are often made with gelatin). In the Middle Ages, the dish was prepared with chicken or fish, rice, sugar, and almond milk or milk and other ingredients (the dish was probably influenced by the Arab cuisine of Muslim Spain). Today the primary ingredients in Spain tend to be milk, almonds, corn starch or gelatin, and sugar. The variants in Spain are often somewhat different from those in France or the United Kingdom.\nThis term is used in Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina (not to be confused with natillas which is a similar but separate dish). It refers to a set of similar dishes traditionally made by slowly and gently cooking pure (normally non-homogenized) milk to thicken and reduce the volume, and gradually adding sugar. In some regions other ingredients such as vanilla, citrus juices, cinnamon, and even rice may also be added. Usually a double boiler of some sort is employed so as to prevent browning of the mixture (which would give it a different flavor). The result is a white or cream-colored, thick spread with a consistency much like that of a thick cake frosting although the flavor is more like that of sweetened cream (with accents of whatever additional ingredients may have been added). The cooking process is largely the same as for creating sweetened condensed milk except that the result is normally thicker.\nAlthough manjar blanco can be used as spread much like jelly or jam is used in the U.S., it is also commonly used as a filling for pastries and cookies such as alfajores and tejas.\nIn Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries in Central America manjar de leche is a pudding or custard made with milk, cornstarch (to thicken), sugar, and often other ingredients such as vanilla, cinnamon or other flavorings. This white-colored confection may be eaten by itself or used as a pastry filling. In Costa Rica, the term \"natilla\" refers to a cultured buttermilk-like product with a butterfat content ranging from 12% (\"liviana\") to 14%, sold in stores in plastic pouches. It is used as a condiment on such dishes as gallo pinto, baked potatoes, steamed vegetables and the like.\nManjar blanco is a traditional Christmas dish in Colombia, along with natilla. It is made out of ingredients like milk, rice, and sugar, which are heated for a long period of time until the right texture is achieved. Manjar blanco is usually eaten with a slice of natilla, bu\u00f1uelos, and hojuelas, creating a flavor combination from the salty bu\u00f1uelos with the two sweet desserts. Manjar blanco can be found in stores during Christmas time, but is also found in stores throughout the year.\nA local adaptation of this dessert is called maja blanca, and uses coconut milk instead of milk.

Natillas is a diminutive of nata (\"cream\", in English), that is, crema de leche (milk cream), referring to the consistency of the dish.\n\nIn Spain, natillas is a custard dish typically made with milk, sugar, vanilla, eggs, and\ncinnamon. The dish\nis prepared by gently boiling the milk and slowly stirring in the eggs (often just the yolks) and other ingredients to create a sweet custard. The differences between Spanish natillas, English custard or French cr\u00e8me anglaise are vague, mainly related to their thickness.\nThis custard (though is a pouring thin cream and not a coagulated custard) is also similar to flan but is typically richer, makes generous use of cinnamon flavoring, and does not use caramel as flan normally\ndoes.\nNew Mexican natillas are derived directly from the recipes of Spain as a result of the Spanish Conquest and the existing Spanish descendants. Such natillas are custard-like in consistency and may, in some recipes, have flour in addition to egg whites. They are not to be confused with Mexican natillas.\nIn Colombia, natilla is the most popular Christmas dish and is eaten along with bu\u00f1uelos and manjar blanco, and it resembles a flan or pudding. Some of the ingredients include milk, panela (blocks of brown sugar), cinnamon sticks, and flour or cornstarch. Occasionally people like to add grated coconut or raisins but these are optional ingredients. To garnish it, powdered cinnamon is spread on top of the finished natilla. Natilla is found all throughout the Christmas season and usually stores sell pre-made natilla; but one of the best known Christmas traditions in Colombia is making natilla in an improvised campfire in the streets or home patios.\nThis term is used in Peru, especially the city of Piura, a spread made of milk and chancaca that is boiled until it is thick and the sugar has caramelized to a rich brown color. The Peruvian confection is arguably more similar to Spanish natilla except that it is somewhat thicker and has no eggs.\nIn Mexico, Natillas are also found and resemble a thicker version of the dessert drink called \"Atole.\"\nIn Costa Rica, the term is used for a sour cream-like dairy product used as a condiment with a variety of dishes. The product is homogenized and pasteurized milk with a lower fat content (about 12%) than normal sour cream, some brands add salt to the cream.\nNatilla in Cuba is classified as a cold custard dessert. Natilla is made with cornstarch, vanilla, sugar, eggs, lemon peel, cinnamon, and evaporated milk. Typically served on Christmas in small cups with cinnamon sprinkled on top.\nThere are two versions of this dessert that exist on the island. \nOne version is served for breakfast and cooked stove top in a pot. Served cold or hot, has less or no sugar because it is often served with honey, fruit and nuts. \nAnother version using the same ingredients is served on Christmas and baked in same fashion as cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \nBoth versions include, milk, coconut cream, sugar, a large amount of egg yolks, cornstarch, cinnamon, vanilla, zest, and orange blossom water. \nPuerto Rican Natilla can be bought all year around in supermarkets and convenient stores as a prepackaged powder with just the requirement of heating with milk.\nBu\u00f1uelos\nFlan\nHojuelas\nList of custard desserts\nManjar blanco\nPubliboda Espana: Natillas Archived 2007-09-28 at the Wayback Machine\n\"Natillas\". bellaonline.com.

The dish is essentially equivalent to the cocido of Spain but lacking colorants (such as paprika), using local ingredients which vary from one region to another. In Spain chickpeas are widely used.

In Andalusia, puchero was originally a peasant soup. The basic ingredients of the broth are meat (beef, veal, pork or chicken), bacon, cured bones (such as those of the jam\u00f3n serrano), and vegetables (potatoes, celery, chard, leek, carrots, and turnips). It can be drunk straight in mugs as a consomm\u00e9 known as caldo de puchero, which can be seasoned with fresh spearmint leaves or sherry. Alternatively, it can be prepared as a soup after adding chickpeas, cured ham, boiled egg, and rice, noodles or bread. The meats, called pring\u00e1, are usually served separately as a main dish, and the remnants used for subsequent dishes as croquettes or ropa vieja.\nPuchero is eaten in the parts of Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay that border the R\u00edo de la Plata. The dish is prepared in the same way as in Spain, though its ingredients differ according to the very different local produce.  In the parts of Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay surrounding the estuary of the R\u00edo de la Plata, puchero is primarily beef-based\u2014beef was plentiful and cheap\u2014and chickpeas are less commonly used than in the Iberian peninsula. The broth and the solid ingredients are often consumed separately.\nThe cuts of meat used are particularly important: if possible, ossobuco; otherwise beef cuts with marrow or poultry (used in puchero de gallina) can be substituted. Other ingredients used may include potatoes, onions, and squash. Typical local produce used includes sweet potatoes, sweet corn, carrots, bacon, local chorizo (a sausage quite different from Spanish cured chorizo made with paprika), pork belly, cabbage, and eggs.\nPuchero is traditionally served during the colder months. It is not considered fine dining, and can be found on menus in family and regional restaurants throughout Argentina, but not at most more expensive restaurants.\nIn Philippine cuisine, puchero (Spanish: Pochero; Tagalog: putsero) is a dish composed of beef chunks stewed with saba bananas (or plantains). The dish may also include potatoes or sweet potatoes, chorizos de Bilbao, bok choy, leeks, chickpeas, cabbage and tomato sauce. Other versions replace beef with chicken or pork.\nThe Yucatec puchero varies by cook and region. The most complete version is called puchero de tres carnes -- \"with three meats\", pork, beef and chicken.  This could actually be a great vegetarian dish if made without the meat as the other ingredients include:  a piece of plantain in skin, onion, potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, squash (calabaza), turnips or parsnips (when and where available), white cabbage (repollo) and typically a type of pasta soup (noodles, fideos) and rice to increase the heartiness and especially if only one or two meats are used.  The soup like  the 98% of Yucatec soups-stews are broth consomm\u00e9s, not at all thick or heavy. It is flavored with saffron, allspice and black pepper.  The dish is served with all ingredients in the bowl and a side of fresh additions.  Typically or traditionally, a side plate is provided so that the person can put the meat to the side while eating the soup. The garnish consists of freshly chopped or diced habanero chili, onion, radish and cilantro. Avocados when in season.

                "description": "Manjar blanco ([maxa blako]), also known as manjar de leche or simply manjar, is a term used in Spanish-speaking area of the world in reference to a variety of milk-based delicacies. In Spain the term refers to blancmange, a European delicacy found in various parts of the continent as well as the United Kingdom. In the Americas (South America primarily) it refers to a sweet, white spread or pastry filling made with milk. This term is sometimes used interchangeably with dulce de leche or cajeta in Latin America but these terms generally refer to delicacies prepared differently from those just described. Related dishes exist by other names in other countries, such as tembleque in Puerto Rico. ...",

Manjar blanco in Spain and in other parts of Europe refers to a dessert (blancmange in English), traditionally light brown in color (although often colored by added ingredients), made with a mould with a consistency like gelatin (in fact modern varieties are often made with gelatin). In the Middle Ages, the dish was prepared with chicken or fish, rice, sugar, and almond milk or milk and other ingredients (the dish was probably influenced by the Arab cuisine of Muslim Spain). Today the primary ingredients in Spain tend to be milk, almonds, corn starch or gelatin, and sugar. The variants in Spain are often somewhat different from those in France or the United Kingdom.\nThis term is used in Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina (not to be confused with natillas which is a similar but separate dish). It refers to a set of similar dishes traditionally made by slowly and gently cooking pure (normally non-homogenized) milk to thicken and reduce the volume, and gradually adding sugar. In some regions other ingredients such as vanilla, citrus juices, cinnamon, and even rice may also be added. Usually a double boiler of some sort is employed so as to prevent browning of the mixture (which would give it a different flavor). The result is a white or cream-colored, thick spread with a consistency much like that of a thick cake frosting although the flavor is more like that of sweetened cream (with accents of whatever additional ingredients may have been added). The cooking process is largely the same as for creating sweetened condensed milk except that the result is normally thicker.\nAlthough manjar blanco can be used as spread much like jelly or jam is used in the U.S., it is also commonly used as a filling for pastries and cookies such as alfajores and tejas.\nIn Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries in Central America manjar de leche is a pudding or custard made with milk, cornstarch (to thicken), sugar, and often other ingredients such as vanilla, cinnamon or other flavorings. This white-colored confection may be eaten by itself or used as a pastry filling. In Costa Rica, the term \"natilla\" refers to a cultured buttermilk-like product with a butterfat content ranging from 12% (\"liviana\") to 14%, sold in stores in plastic pouches. It is used as a condiment on such dishes as gallo pinto, baked potatoes, steamed vegetables and the like.\nManjar blanco is a traditional Christmas dish in Colombia, along with natilla. It is made out of ingredients like milk, rice, and sugar, which are heated for a long period of time until the right texture is achieved. Manjar blanco is usually eaten with a slice of natilla, bu\u00f1uelos, and hojuelas, creating a flavor combination from the salty bu\u00f1uelos with the two sweet desserts. Manjar blanco can be found in stores during Christmas time, but is also found in stores throughout the year.\nA local adaptation of this dessert is called maja blanca, and uses coconut milk instead of milk. It also contains corn kernels, and this variation is known as maja blanca con maiz.\nBu\u00f1uelos\nHojuelas\nList of spreads\n\"Web Gastronomica de Enrique Domenech: Manjar Blanco Receta\" (in Spanish).

The name wanko comes from the regional dialect of the Iwate Prefecture from which it comes, meaning \"bowl\", but more specifically, a small, wooden Japanese soup bowl.  There are many theories about the origin of the dish itself however.\nOne such origin is of a landowner who was having a festival on his land.  There was a crowd of over 100 villagers and guests who customarily ate soba at festivals. However, there were so many people to feed but the pots in which the soba were to be made were very small. The soba noodles were spread around in reduced quantities so that there would be enough for everyone.\nNanbu Toshinao, a territorial lord of the Nanbu area, came and stopped at a house in Hanamaki asking for a meal.  His retainers served him a local variety of soba in a small soup bowl.  Thinking they served Nanbu Toshinao something too rustic and without much flavor, they were afraid of his reaction.  But Nanbu Toshinao thought it was delicious, and ordered more servings.  This is said to have established the tradition of hosts continuing to serve small bowls until their guest was satisfied.\nThere are many stories of how the dish came to be, but these two are the most common. However, as the term \"wanko\" did not come about until after World War II, some repudiate the stories.\nIn December 1957, the Hanamaki-shi Cultural Centre was the site of the first annual contest on who could eat the most bowls of wanko soba. The event continues to this day featuring noodle fans from many countries.\nWanko Soba is one of the Three Great Noodles of Morioka (\u76db\u5ca1\u4e09\u5927\u9eba) along with Morioka Reimen (\u76db\u5ca1\u51b7\u9eba) and Morioka Jajamen (\u76db\u5ca1\u3058\u3083\u3058\u3083\u9eba)\nPerry, Julien. \"Competitive Eating\".

Another variation uses thicker Chinese noodles (called chanpon noodles). The style and thickness of noodles varies between restaurants.

Ashure or Noah's pudding is a dessert porridge that is made of a mixture consisting of grains, fruits, dried fruits and nuts. \nIn the Balkans and Turkey Sufi Muslims make the dish during the month of Muharram in which the Day of Ashure takes place. Traditionally, ashure is made in large quantities to commemorate the ark's landing and is distributed to friends, relatives, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, and others, without regard to the recipient's religion or belief system as an offering of peace and love. Ashure was traditionally made and eaten during the colder months of the year due to its heavy and calorie rich nature, but now it is enjoyed year-round. Armenians make it as a Christmas pudding and for New Year's celebrations, where it is a centerpiece.\nIn anecdotal history, it is claimed that when Noah's Ark came to rest on Mount Ararat, Noah's family celebrated with a special dish. Since their supplies were nearly exhausted, what was left (primarily grains, dried fruits and the like) was cooked together to form a pudding, what is now called ashure. \nTurkish families make ashure pudding to commemorate this event. Among Turkish and Bosnian Sufis (especially Bektashi), the ashure pudding is prepared with special prayers for health, healing, safety, success and spiritual nourishment. Ashure is distributed to the poor, as well as to neighbors, friends and relatives.\nEvliya \u00c7elebi says in his travelbook Seyahatname that \"Ashure is a porridge (a\u015f) that should be cooked at the tenth of Muharram.\"\nIn Armenia, ashure may be garnished with pomegranate seeds and flavored with rose water, and the pudding is shared with neighbors during the Christmas season. The festive pudding is the centerpiece of the New Year's table, which is often decorated with dried fruits, nuts and pomegranates.\nThe word Ashure comes from the Arabic word Ashura Arabic: \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0621\u200e \u02bb\u0100sh\u016br\u0101\u2019\u00a0, meaning 'tenth'. In Turkish tradition, this dish is made mostly on 10th of Muharram or after 10th of Muharram in Islamic Lunar Calendar. The association with Muharram is not only significant in Islamic beliefs, but also pre-Islamic beliefs, with some Semitic stories also referencing this month.\nAlso in Turkish, Ash(A\u015f) represents mixed porridge. It is derived from Persian word \"Ashur\" meaning mixing.\nAshoriya, grains and cereals are eaten in remembrance for the drowned people of Noah's flood in Mandaeism\nFieldhouse, P. (2017).

Pandoro appeared in remote times, the product of the ancient art of breadmaking, as the name, pan d'oro (literally: 'golden bread'), suggests. Throughout the Middle Ages, white bread was consumed solely by the rich, while the common people could only afford black bread and, often, not even that. Sweet breads were reserved for nobility. Breads enriched with eggs, butter, and sugar or honey were served in the palaces and were known as royal bread or golden bread.\nThe desserts consumed in the 17th century were described in the book Suor Celeste Galilei, Letters to Her Father, published by La Rosa of Turin, and they included \"royal bread\" made from flour, sugar, butter and eggs. However, the bread was already known and appreciated in the ancient Rome of Pliny the Elder, in the 1st century. That bread was made with \"the finest flour combined with eggs, butter and oil\". Virgil and Livy mentioned the preparation under the name Libum.\nThe first citation of a dessert clearly identified as pandoro dates to the 18th century. The dessert certainly figured in the cuisine of the Venetian aristocracy. Venice was the principal market for spices as late as the 18th century, as well as for the sugar that by then had replaced honey in European pastries and breads made from leavened dough. And it was at Verona, in Venetian territory, that the formula for making pandoro was developed and perfected, a process that required a century. The modern history of this dessert bread began at Verona on October 30, 1894, when Domenico Melegatti obtained a patent for a procedure to be applied in producing pandoro industrially.\nPanettone, a similar Italian Christmas bread\nColomba Pasquale, a traditional Italian Easter bread\ndi Giovine, Elia (1989).

Thus, the inhabitants of the region used to buy it and referred to it as \u201cPan del Bono\u201d meaning \u201cBread from El Bono\u201d and by the continued use the name was abbreviated as \u201cPandebono\u201d.\nStill another version states that the name comes from the voucher (Spanish \u201cbono\u201d) the workers from the region's sugar cane farms received as part of their compensation, which could be exchanged for bread. Therefore, the name would mean \u201cvoucher bread\u201d.\nColombian cuisine\nList of breads\nPan de yuca\nAm\u00e9rica Pintoresca, Montaner y Simon, 1884, vol. 3, pp.\u00a0704",

Pandoro appeared in remote times, the product of the ancient art of breadmaking, as the name, pan d'oro (literally: 'golden bread'), suggests. Throughout the Middle Ages, white bread was consumed solely by the rich, while the common people could only afford black bread and, often, not even that. Sweet breads were reserved for nobility. Breads enriched with eggs, butter, and sugar or honey were served in the palaces and were known as royal bread or golden bread.\nThe desserts consumed in the 17th century were described in the book Suor Celeste Galilei, Letters to Her Father, published by La Rosa of Turin, and they included \"royal bread\" made from flour, sugar, butter and eggs. However, the bread was already known and appreciated in the ancient Rome of Pliny the Elder, in the 1st century. That bread was made with \"the finest flour combined with eggs, butter and oil\". Virgil and Livy mentioned the preparation under the name Libum.\nThe first citation of a dessert clearly identified as pandoro dates to the 18th century. The dessert certainly figured in the cuisine of the Venetian aristocracy. Venice was the principal market for spices as late as the 18th century, as well as for the sugar that by then had replaced honey in European pastries and breads made from leavened dough. And it was at Verona, in Venetian territory, that the formula for making pandoro was developed and perfected, a process that required a century. The modern history of this dessert bread began at Verona on October 30, 1894, when Domenico Melegatti obtained a patent for a procedure to be applied in producing pandoro industrially.\nPanettone, a similar Italian Christmas bread\nColomba Pasquale, a traditional Italian Easter bread\ndi Giovine, Elia (1989).

Campbell\u2019s Cream of Mushroom flavored soup variety was created in 1934 and was the first of the company's soups to be marketed as a sauce as well as a soup. It became so widely used as casserole filler in recipes for the hotdish recipes popular in Minnesota that it was sometimes referred to as \"Lutheran binder.\" Like other food companies, Campbell's employed recipe developers to create recipes using their products as part of their marketing strategy.\nDorcas Reilly (1926\u20132018) created the recipe in 1955 while working in the home economics department at the Campbell's Soup Company. The recipe was created for a feature article for the Associated Press; the requirement was for a quick and easy dish using ingredients most US households kept on hand. \nIt was called \"Green Bean Bake\" when the recipe began being printed on soup cans. Initially the dish did not test well within the company but, in part because of Reilly's persistence, eventually earned a reputation for being \"the ultimate comfort food.\" Culinary historian Laura Shapiro called the recipe's use of the crunch fried onion topping was a \"touch of genius\" that gave an otherwise ordinary convenience-food side dish a bit of \"glamour\".\nFood & Wine called it iconic, and Good Housekeeping said that \"few dishes are as iconic\" as the green bean casserole.\nIt was originally marketed as an everyday side dish but became popular for Thanksgiving dinners in the 1960s after Campbell's placed the recipe on the can's label. The recipe popularized the combination of the soup with green beans. Campbell's Soup now estimates that 40 percent of the Cream of Mushroom soup sold in the United States goes into making green bean casserole. As of 2020 Campbell's estimated it was served in 20 million Thanksgiving dinners in the US each year. Campbell's in 2020 reported their online version of the recipe is viewed 4 million times each Thanksgiving Day. According to Campbell's as of 2018, the recipe is the most popular ever developed in their kitchens. Campbell's has estimated that 40% of its cream of mushroom soup sales become ingredients in a green bean casserole. \nFolklorist Lucy Long in 2007 noted that its inclusion on Thanksgiving dinner tables crosses ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious differences. She also notes it is included in most popular American cookbooks, mentioned in the media regularly, and referred to a \"classic\", \"traditional\", and \"a Thanksgiving standard\". She wrote that the popularity of the dish was related to its categorization as a casserole, which in the US is associated with \"communal eating, sharing, and generosity\" and that the green bean casserole in particular represents the familiar and also the festive.\nThe recipe, which hasn't changed, calls for green beans, mushroom soup, milk, soy sauce, ground black pepper, and french fried onions. The beans, soup, milk, and seasonings are mixed together with a portion of the onions and baked, then topped with more onions and baked for another few minutes.   \nMultiple similar recipes have been developed that \"update\" or \"upgrade\" the original recipe to use fresh beans, homemade cream sauce, and fresh mushrooms as the convenience-food based recipes of the 1950s and 1960s have become less fashionable, but according to culinary historian Shapiro, the green bean casserole remains popular for Thanksgiving for reasons of nostalgia. Other recipes have been developed, by Campbell's and others, that incorporate a variety of ingredients in addition to or in replacement of those in the original.\nIn November of 2002, Reilly, representing Campbell's, donated the original recipe card to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio. The donation was followed by a meal featuring the dish. Reilly died 15 October 2018, at the age of 92 in her hometown of Camden, New Jersey.\nList of casserole dishes\nMarketing\nLong, Lucy (Spring 2007). \"Green Bean Casserole: The Logic of a Midwestern Foodways Aesthetic\".

The English name for moussaka was borrowed from Greek mousak\u00e1s (\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c2) and from other Balkan languages, all borrowed from Ottoman Turkish, which in turn borr\u03bfwed it from Arabic musaqqa\u2018a (\u0645\u0633\u0642\u0639\u0629, lit.\u2009'that which is fed liquid'). or from mu\u1e63aqqa\u2018a (\u0645\u0635\u0642\u0639\u0629, lit.\u2009'pounded'  or 'cold'). The word is first attested in English in 1862, written m\u00f9z\u00e0kk\u00e0.\n\nMost versions are based primarily on saut\u00e9ed aubergine (eggplant) and tomato, usually with minced meat, mostly lamb. The Greek version includes layers of meat and eggplant topped with a b\u00e9chamel (\"white\") sauce and baked.\nThe modern Greek version was created by the French-trained Greek chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s. His recipe has three layers that are separately cooked before being combined for the final baking: a bottom layer of sliced eggplant saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; a middle layer of ground lamb lightly cooked with chopped or pur\u00e9ed tomatoes, onion, garlic, and spices (cinnamon, allspice and black pepper); and a top layer of b\u00e9chamel sauce or savoury custard.\nThere are variations on this basic recipe, sometimes with no top sauce, sometimes with other vegetables.  Such variants may include, in addition to the eggplant slices, saut\u00e9ed zucchini (courgette) slices, part-fried potato slices, or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. There is a fast-day (vegan) version in Tselementes' cookbook, which includes neither meat nor dairy products, just vegetables (ground eggplant is used instead of ground meat), tomato sauce, and bread crumbs.\nAnother variant is (melitzanes) papoutsakia (\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2) \u03c0\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1  (lit.\u2009'eggplant, little shoe style') which consists of whole small eggplant stuffed with ground meat and topped with b\u00e9chamel and baked.\nIn Albania, Bulgaria, the former Yugoslavia, and Romania, potatoes are used instead of eggplant, pork or beef mince, and the top layer is usually milk or yogurt mixed with raw eggs, sometimes with a small amount of flour added. There is also a three-layer version: the bottom layer consists of ground pork and beef, the middle layer of potato slices, and the top layer is typically a custard. Each layer is cooked on its own and layered in a pan and baked until the top is browned.\nThe Romanian version is made usually with potatoes or eggplant or cabbage. The layers start with the vegetable, then the layer of meat (usually pork), then vegetables, until the pot is full. Sometimes bread crumbs are used for toppings, sometimes slices of tomatoes and crushed cheese. The pot is then filled with tomato sauce. There is also a pasta variant, with pasta being used instead of vegetables. The \"fasting\" variant, which is vegan, replaces meat with mushrooms or a mix of saut\u00e9ed onions and rice.\nIn the rest of the Balkans, the top layer is often a custard: this is the version introduced in the UK by Elizabeth David's Mediterranean Cookery and where it remains the usual presentation. Grated cheese or bread crumbs are often sprinkled on top.\nIn the Levant, moussaka is a cooked dish made up primarily of tomatoes and eggplant, similar to Sicilian caponata, and may also include chickpeas. It may be served cold as a mezze dish, or hot.\nThe Egyptian version of moussaka is made from layers of fried eggplant immersed in tomato sauce and then baked. A layer of seasoned cooked ground beef is usually added between the eggplant before baking. The dish can be served hot but is usually chilled for a day or so to improve the taste.\nTurkish musakka is not layered. Instead, thinly sliced eggplant is fried and served in tomato-based meat sauce seasoned with green peppers, garlic and onions. It is generally eaten with pilav and cac\u0131k. There are also variants with zucchini (courgettes, kabak musakka), carrots (havu\u00e7 musakka) and potatoes (patates musakka).\nList of casserole dishes\nBobotie - recipe comparable to moussaka, popular in South Africa\nEmpad\u00e3o - recipe comparable to moussaka, popular in Portugal\nKarn\u0131yar\u0131k \u2013 recipe comparable to moussaka, popular in Turkey\nPastitsio \u2013 Greek baked pasta dish\nParmigiana - sliced\u00a0eggplant\u00a0layered with\u00a0cheese\u00a0and\u00a0tomato sauce and then baked, popular in Italy\nShepherd's pie \u2013 recipe comparable to moussaka, popular in the United Kingdom\nTepsi Baytinijan \u2013 recipe comparable to moussaka, popular in Iraq\nOxford English Dictionary 3rd ed., March 2003 s.v.

Donauwelle (literally 'Danube wave' in German) is a traditional sheet cake popular in Germany and Austria. It is made of layers of plain and chocolate pound cake combined to have a wavy border between them. It contains sour cherries and is topped with buttercream and chocolate glaze.\nThe cake's name comes from its wavy pattern inside and its swirled chocolate decoration, although the reason for naming it after the Danube in particular is not clear. It could refer to its popularity in those countries that the river flows through. Other names for the cake are Schneewittchenkuchen, meaning 'Snow White cake', and Schneewittchentorte, referring to its color scheme of black, white and red, like the character of Snow White in the Brothers Grimm's fairy tale.\nRecipe of Donauwelle\nA version from My Best German Recipes",

According to the rules proposed by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, the genuine Neapolitan pizza dough consists of wheat flour (type 0 or 00, or a mixture of both), natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer's yeast, salt and water. For proper results, strong flour with high protein content (as used for bread-making rather than cakes) must be used. The dough must be kneaded by hand or with a low-speed mixer. After the rising process, the dough must be formed by hand without the help of a rolling pin or other machine, and may be no more than 3 millimeters (0.12\u00a0in) thick. The pizza must be baked for 60\u201390 seconds in a 485\u00a0\u00b0C (905\u00a0\u00b0F) wood-fired oven. When cooked, it should be soft, elastic, tender and fragrant.\nThere are different variants, but the original one is called pizza Margherita, and it follows the essential rules for the ingredients, tomato, sliced mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil, sometimes with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on top. Other variants are: pizza marinara, which is made with tomato, garlic, oregano and extra virgin olive oil and pizza Margherita DOP made with tomato, buffalo mozzarella from Campania, basil and extra virgin olive oil. The pizza napoletana is a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) product in Europe. The TSG certification attests that a particular food product objectively possesses specific characteristics which differentiate it from all others in its category, and that its raw materials, composition or method of production have been consistent for a minimum of 30 years.\nIn Argentina, a pizza a la napolitana (\"Neapolitan-style pizza\") is a pizza topped with mozzarella cheese and slices of fresh tomato, which may also be flavoured with garlic.\nNeapolitan pizza has a protected status granted by the Italian Standardization Body administered by the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana (AVPN). A protected designation is available to pizzerias that meet strict requirements in following Neapolitan traditions in the art of pizza making.\nThe European Union has recognized Pizza Napoletana as Traditional Speciality Guaranteed since 5 February 2010.\nList of pizza varieties by country\nAssociazione Vera Pizza Napoletana (AVPN)\n\"Official Journal of the European Union\". lex.europa.eu. 2008.

Nineteenth century descriptions of \"avral bread\" (funeral biscuits) vary from place to place but it sometimes described as \"sponge biscuits\" or a \"crisp sponge\" with a light dusting of sugar \". Traditional American sponge recipes diverged from earlier methods of preparation, adding ingredients like vinegar, baking powder, hot water or milk. \nThe basic recipe is also used for madeleines, ladyfingers, and trifles, as well as some versions of strawberry shortcake.\nAlthough sponge cake is usually made without butter, its flavor is often enhanced with buttercream, pastry cream or other types of fillings and frostings. Sponge soaks up flavors from fresh fruits, fillings and custard sauces. Sponge cake covered in boiled icing was very popular in American cuisine during the 1920s and 1930s. The delicate texture of sponge and angel food cakes, and the difficulty of their preparation, meant these cakes were more expensive than daily staple pies. The historic Frances Virginia Tea Room in Atlanta served sponge cake with lemon filling and boiled icing. New York City's Crumperie served not only crumpets but toasted sponge cake as well.\nThe basic whisked sponge cake does not contain any fat. It is made by whisking egg whites and caster sugar and gently folding in flour. The process of whisking egg whites incorporates air bubbles to create a foam by agitating the protein albumen to create a partially coagulated membrane, making the egg whites stiffer and increasing their volume. This type of cake, also called foam cake, depends on aeration of eggs and heat to rise. Some types of sponge are baked in ungreased pans to improve the cake's rise by allowing the batter to adhere and climb the sides of the pan. To maintain the moisture of the cake it is sometimes made with potato flour.\nVariations on the basic sponge sometimes add butter or egg yolks to make the cake more moist. For Genoise cake flour and melted butter are added to the egg mixture for a moister cake. The \"biscuit\" sponge from early American cuisine is made by beating egg yolks with sugar, then alternately folding in whisked egg whites and flour. Anne Willan says both types of sponge cake are represented in French cuisine. According to Willan \"sponge may have some butter added, but not much or it will not rise\". Cream of tartar or baking soda are recommended by some turn of the century cookbooks to make Swiss rolls more pliable and easier to roll. \nFor some cakes, like the Victoria Sponge, fat and sugar are creamed before eggs and flour are incorporated into the batter, similar to pound cake. In British English layer cakes like the Victoria Sponge are called \"sandwich sponge\". This type of buttery cake was not possible without baking powder, which was discovered by English food manufacturer Alfred Bird in 1843, allowing the sponge to rise higher.\n\nIn the Philippines, sponge cakes and chiffon cakes were introduced during the Spanish period. They are known collectively as mam\u00f3n. They are typically baked as cupcakes (torta), as loaves (taisan), or as cake rolls (pianono). Traditionally they are simply served with just butter (or margarine) and white sugar. Variants of mam\u00f3n also use unique ingredients, the most common being purple yam and pandan leaves which result in the ube cake and the buko pandan cake. Crispy cookie-like versions are known as mam\u00f3n tostado and broas.\nSteamed sponge cake like the ma lai gao are commonly found in Malaysia. Chinese almond sponge is steamed and topped with boiled icing, chocolate, vegetables or fresh fruit. Korean sponge called saeng is usually made with rice flour and topped with whipped topping and fruit. Some Vietnamese varieties may have fresh herbs like mint, lemon grass or basil added to the batter, and be topped with caramelized tropical fruit. Milk and jaggery are added to sponge cake in India which is served with the creamy Sri Lankan specialty \"avocado crazy\". Western style sponge cakes topped with whipped cream and strawberries are popular in Japan where sponge is also used as a base for cheesecakes.\nAngel food cake is a 19th-century American cake that contains no egg yolks or butter. The cake is leavened using only egg whites and baking powder. This recipe can be traced to 18th century American cookbooks. The delicate cake is baked in an ungreased pan and cooled upside down.\nThe official state dessert of Massachusetts, the Boston cream pie, is a chocolate-glazed, layered yellow sponge cake filled",

                "description": "A chiffon cake is a very light cake made with vegetable oil, eggs, sugar, flour, baking powder, and flavorings. Being made with vegetable oil, instead of a traditional solid fat such as butter or shortening, it is easier to beat air into the batter. As a result, chiffon cakes (as well as angel cakes and other foam cakes) achieve a fluffy texture by having egg whites beaten separately until stiff and then folded into the cake batter before baking. Its aeration properties rely on both the quality of the meringue and the chemical leaveners. A chiffon cake combines methods used with sponge cakes and conventional cakes. ...",

The high oil and egg content create a very moist cake, and as oil is liquid even at cooler temperatures, chiffon cakes do not tend to harden or dry out as traditional butter cakes might. This makes them better-suited than many cakes to filling or frosting with ingredients that need to be refrigerated or frozen, such as pastry cream or ice cream. The lack of butter, however, means that chiffon cakes lack much of the rich flavor of butter cakes.\nThe recipe is credited to Harry Baker (1883\u20131974), a Californian insurance salesman turned caterer. Baker kept the recipe secret for 20 years until he sold it to General Mills, which spread the recipe through marketing materials in the 1940s and 1950s under the name \"chiffon cake\", and a set of 14 recipes and variations was released to the public in a Betty Crocker pamphlet published in 1948.\nIn the United States, March 29 is National Lemon Chiffon Cake Day.\nJapanese cheesecake\nPaper wrapped cake\nList of lemon dishes and beverages\nMalgieri, Nick. \"CAKES: RECIPES AND TIPS\".

Genoise is a basic building block of much French p\u00e2tisserie and is used for making several different types of cake. The batter usually is baked to form a thin sheet.  An 1884 cookbook gives a simple recipe for a genoise:\nWork together briskly in a basin half a pound of flour, half a pound of sugar, and four eggs:  after five minutes' good stirring, add a quarter of a pound of melted butter.  Butter a square baking sheet, spread the paste upon it, and bake it in a moderate oven until it turns a golden yellow.\nWhen finished baking, the sheet is rolled while still warm (to make jelly rolls or b\u00fbches de No\u00ebl), or cut and stacked into multiple layers or line a mold to be filled with a frozen dessert.  A variety of fillings are used, such as jelly, chocolate, fruit, pastry cream, and whipped cream.  The genoise can be piped in strips to make ladyfingers or into molds to make madeleines. It is the base for Jaffa Cakes.\nThe cake is notable for its elastic and somewhat dry texture and is sometimes soaked with flavored syrups or liqueurs and often served with a buttercream frosting. The popular tiramisu cake may be made with ladyfingers or a genoise sheet.\nA chocolate genoise can be made by substituting cocoa powder for some of the flour, and is sometimes used as a substitute for the richer cake used in the standard Sacher torte recipe.\nCastella\nGenoa cake\nLamington\nZuppa Inglese\nG\u00e2teau magique\nCuisine of Liguria\nList of Italian dishes\n\"genoise\".

It is prepared and given at weddings and other festivals in southern India \nand is very popular in baby showers.\nThe Maharaja of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wodeyar IV, was a food lover and maintained a large kitchen at the Amba Vilas Palace in Mysore, making cuisines from European to Prasadam in the temples.\nThis sweet, by his chief chef Kakasura Madappa. With time running out, the desperate Madappa began experimenting, wanting to present the King with something unusual. Adding gram flour, ghee and sugar, he made a soft pak (or mixture). Handed over in the royal thali is a hot, fudge-like sweet. The chef was called in and asked its name. He said the first thing that came to his mind - the 'Mysore Pak.\nPaaka or extreme sweet refers to the sticky sugar syrup obtained by simmering sugar with an equal amount of water; specifically for Mysore pak, the simple syrup heated to the softball stage. The syrup, used as the primary sweetening agent in various Indian sweet dishes like Jalebi, Badam puri, Mysore pak and others. The syrup is given taste with spice essences like cardamom, rose, honey etc. Paaka syrup preparation is a skilled art mastered by few cooks. Some of whom keep their methods secret.\nThis sweet Mysore pak improved as time goes by. However, the original sweet made with the original recipe is still available at the famous \"Guru Sweets\" stores in Devaraja Market, run by Mr Nataraj, great-grandson of the original inventor of the dish Mr Kakasura Madappa.\nMysore Pak is made from Gram flour (Besan), Ghee, Sugar and Water. It is commonly used in Southern India. Other ingredients that may or may not be used are Baking soda and Cardamom.\nShape:  Mysore pak is cut into cubes or cuboids.\n Texture:  Hard and porous when made with less ghee, soft and dense when made with generous amount of ghee. Moisture from the sugar syrup escapes as steam through the greased gram-flour rendering Mysore pak porous. Excess ghee, if any, may fill in such pores rendering it dense.\n Colour:  Yellow to light brown due to gram flour (roasted).\n Shelf life:  Very little water is used in the preparation, so it can stay fresh in a cool and dry place, but it should be used within one month only.\nDharwad pedha\nByadagi chilli\nUdupi Mattu Gulla\nMujumdar, Neha (24 November 2012). \"In search of Mysore Pak\" \u2013 via www.thehindu.com.\n\"Four generations - mysore pak still crowd puller here\" \u2013 via www.deccanchronicle.com.\nhttps://www.ndtv.com/south/how-the-famous-mysore-pak-was-invented-674512?amp=1&akamai-rum=off How the Famous Mysore Pak Was Invented\nhttps://www.indianmirror.com/culture/indian-specialties/mysorepak.html",

The recipe cake was brought to the local Hotel Park in 1953 by I\u0161tvan Luka\u010devi\u0107\n, chef of the hotel's confectionery store. He came to Bled from Serbia where a similar cake was already known. As of October 2009, 10 million cream cakes have been baked at the hotel's patisserie since its invention. The name of the dessert means simply \"cream slice\". Most locals refer to it as krem\u0161nita, from the German word Cremeschnitte, with the same meaning. While the kremna rezina from Bled celebrated their 10th million piece production, Sla\u0161\u010di\u010darna Len\u010dek, which is located in Dom\u017eale, in year 2013 celebrated the 75th anniversary since they have made their first one which is called  Len\u010dkova kremna rezina.\nIn Croatia, the two most popular variants are Samoborska krem\u0161nita from the town of Samobor and Zagreba\u010dka krem\u0161nita from the capital, Zagreb. The extremely popular Samoborska krem\u0161nita is characterized by having a puff pastry top, predominantly custard cream filling (less whipped cream) with meringue and is finished with powdered sugar. Zagreba\u010dka krem\u0161nita has a characteristic chocolate icing instead of the puff pastry top, while maintaining the puff pastry base. The classic recipe for Samoborska krem\u0161nita is considered to be designed by \u0110uro Luka\u010di\u0107 in the early 1950s, based on different earlier variants found in patisseries of Zagreb.\nIn Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro, the dish is known as krempita 'cream pie'. It is usually prepared with puff pastry dough. The filling is usually pure thick custard, less commonly combined with meringue (whipped egg whites and sugar) creme. A similar recipe with only meringue filling is called \u0160ampita.\nIn Montenegro, the most famous are the Kotorska krempita or Kotorska pa\u0161ta (Kotor Cremeschnitte). Except for the original recipe, they differ from other crempitas because they are made with three layers of dough and two layers of cream. The \"Kotorska pa\u0161ta\" festival dedicated to this delicacy is held in Kotor every year.\n\nIs made out of filo pastry of usually three layers with cream on top and crumble sprinkled on it.\nCustard pie\nNapoleonka (krem\u00f3wka)\nList of custard desserts\nMille-feuille\n\u0160ampita\nTompouce\n\"Hrvatski jezi\u010dni portal - Krem\u0161nita\".

Sweet soy sauce (Indonesian: kecap manis) is a sweetened aromatic soy sauce, originating in Indonesia, which has a darker color, a viscous syrupy consistency and a molasses-like flavor due to the generous addition of palm sugar. Kecap manis is widely used with satay. It is similar to, though finer in flavor than, Chinese sweet bean sauce (tianmianjiang). It is by far the most popular type of soy sauce employed in Indonesian cuisine, and accounts for an estimated 90 percent of the nation's total soy sauce production.\nKecap manis is an essential sauce in the Indonesian pantry. It is used to add a pleasantly mild sweet and umami flavor in most popular Indonesian dishes; including nasi goreng, mie goreng, kwetiau goreng, ayam kecap (chicken), babi kecap (pork), semur beef stew, and ketoprak. It is also a popular marinade for grilled dishes, such as satay, ayam bakar (grilled chicken) and ikan bakar (grilled fish). Sweet soy sauce is also a popular dipping sauce, mixed with chopped shallot and bird's eye chili and served as dipping sauce to accompany tahu goreng (fried tofu). Steamed rice topped with sunny side fried egg and drizzled with sweet soy sauce is a simple yet popular meal among Indonesian children. In Eastern Indonesia, sweet soy sauce is used as the ingredient of colo-colo dipping sauce, although traditionally this Maluku sauce uses black colored  rendered coconut oil residue.\nIn Indonesia there are large numbers of sweet soy sauce brands. Kecap manis is traditionally a small-scale home industry. However there are a handful of brands that are widely distributed throughout Indonesia and regionally, such as kecap manis ABC, Kecap Bango, Indofood and Sedaap. \nThere are also brands that distribute widely in the Netherlands like Conimex and Trade Mark A\nSweet soy sauce is widely available in Indonesian marketplaces, warungs, minimarkets, supermarkets, toko and Asian grocery stores worldwide. However, it is quite hard to find in most parts of Europe (except for the Netherlands, UK and Germany) and also quite scarce in the Americas. Sweet soy sauce can be made from regular soy sauce. Regular soy sauce mixed with brown sugar, added with a trace of molasses, can serve as a substitute for sweet soy sauce.\nDark soy sauce\nSoup soy sauce\nList of condiments\nList of fermented soy products\nList of sauces\nSweet bean sauce\nTeriyaki sauce\nKetchup\nWilliam Shurtleff; Akiko Aoyagi (2011).

Ashure or Noah's pudding is a dessert porridge that is made of a mixture consisting of grains, fruits, dried fruits and nuts. \nIn the Balkans and Turkey Sufi Muslims make the dish during the month of Muharram in which the Day of Ashure takes place. Traditionally, ashure is made in large quantities to commemorate the ark's landing and is distributed to friends, relatives, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, and others, without regard to the recipient's religion or belief system as an offering of peace and love. Ashure was traditionally made and eaten during the colder months of the year due to its heavy and calorie rich nature, but now it is enjoyed year-round. Armenians make it as a Christmas pudding and for New Year's celebrations, where it is a centerpiece.\nIn anecdotal history, it is claimed that when Noah's Ark came to rest on Mount Ararat, Noah's family celebrated with a special dish. Since their supplies were nearly exhausted, what was left (primarily grains, dried fruits and the like) was cooked together to form a pudding, what is now called ashure. \nTurkish families make ashure pudding to commemorate this event. Among Turkish and Bosnian Sufis (especially Bektashi), the ashure pudding is prepared with special prayers for health, healing, safety, success and spiritual nourishment. Ashure is distributed to the poor, as well as to neighbors, friends and relatives.\nEvliya \u00c7elebi says in his travelbook Seyahatname that \"Ashure is a porridge (a\u015f) that should be cooked at the tenth of Muharram.\"\nIn Armenia, ashure may be garnished with pomegranate seeds and flavored with rose water, and the pudding is shared with neighbors during the Christmas season. The festive pudding is the centerpiece of the New Year's table, which is often decorated with dried fruits, nuts and pomegranates.\nThe word Ashure comes from the Arabic word Ashura Arabic: \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0621\u200e \u02bb\u0100sh\u016br\u0101\u2019\u00a0, meaning 'tenth'. In Turkish tradition, this dish is made mostly on 10th of Muharram or after 10th of Muharram in Islamic Lunar Calendar. The association with Muharram is not only significant in Islamic beliefs, but also pre-Islamic beliefs, with some Semitic stories also referencing this month.\nAlso in Turkish, Ash(A\u015f) represents mixed porridge. It is derived from Persian word \"Ashur\" meaning mixing.\nAshoriya, grains and cereals are eaten in remembrance for the drowned people of Noah's flood in Mandaeism\nFieldhouse, P. (2017).

A bonbon is a small chocolate confection. They are usually filled with liqueur or other sweet ingredients, and sold wrapped in coloured foil.\nThe word \"bonbon\" arose from the reduplication of the word bon, meaning \"good\" in the French language. Its use originated in the seventeenth century within the French royal court, and spread to other European countries by the eighteenth century. Bonbons began to be served in ornate containers by the middle of the eighteenth century, which would be given as gifts at festivals and on holidays such as New Year's Day.\nInspired by bonbons, Johann Strauss II wrote the waltz Wiener Bonbons in 1866. Its title page shows the composition's name in the form of twisted bonbon wrappers.\nAccording to French law, a chocolate candy or bonbon de chocolat must be at least 25% chocolate and can come in several forms:\na bite-sized chocolate;\nan arrangement of different chocolates;\na mixture of chocolate and other edible ingredients.\nSpecifically in the United States, the phrase \"Bon Bon\" can also refer to The Hershey Company's trademarked name of a frozen confection made from vanilla ice cream and covered in chocolate.\nPralines\nBuckeye candy\n\"cioccolatino in Vocabolario\".

Today, however, many kinds of crispbread contain wheat flour, spices and grains, and are often leavened with yeast or sourdough, and milk or sesame seeds can be added. In the case of unleavened crispbread, bubbles are introduced into the dough mechanically. Traditionally, this was done by mixing snow or powdered ice into the dough, which then evaporated during baking. Today, the dough, which must contain a large amount of water, is cooled and mixed until bubbly. Another method is to knead the dough under pressure in an extruder. The sudden drop in pressure then causes water to evaporate, creating bubbles in the dough. ...",

Crispbreads are lightweight and keep fresh for a very long time due to their lack of water. Crispbread is a staple food and was for a long time considered a poor man's diet. However, in recent years there has been renewed interest in crispbread in the Nordic countries.\nFinland and Sweden have long traditions in crispbread consumption. The origin of the crispbread came from the earlier spisbr\u00f6d (stovebread) which was a similar but thicker kind of bread. These breads were baked from at least the 6th century in central Sweden. They were usually hung above the stove to be dried. Traditional crispbread in Sweden and western Finnish is made in  this tradition with the form of a round flat loaf with a hole in the middle to facilitate storage on long poles hanging near the ceiling. Traditionally, crispbreads were baked just twice a year: following harvest and again in the spring when frozen river waters began to flow. The slim crispbread that is common today originated in eastern V\u00e4rmland. Sweden's first industrial crispbread bakery, AU Bergmans enka, began its production in Stockholm in 1850. Rectangular Kn\u00e4ckebrot was first manufactured in Germany in 1927 and has remained popular and readily available there ever since.\nCrispbread itself is very dry and therefore served with a spread, like butter, and optional toppings. Crispbread is usually a part of a daily meal. In Sweden and Finland crispbread and butter or margarine are included in school meals. Crispbread might also be crushed into yogurt or filmj\u00f6lk in place of cereals or muesli, and even used as a pizza base.\nBublik\nDorset knob\nFlatbread\nFlatbr\u00f8d\nHardtack\nLavash\nMatzo\nRyvita, a brand of crispbread\nTunnbr\u00f6d\nWasabr\u00f6d, a Swedish company\nCRISPBREAD\nMedeltida tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rdsv\u00e4xter: Att sp\u00e5ra det f\u00f6rflutna Archived 2009-02-25 at the Wayback Machine\nJan-\u00d6jvind Swahn (2003).

The Natchitoches meat pie is a regional dish from northern Louisiana, United States. It is one of the official state foods of Louisiana.\nIn the modern recipe, ground pork or pork sausage is blended into the ground beef for additional flavor.  Onions, bell pepper and when used garlic and parsley provide aromatics. Ground black pepper and cayenne pepper are added to get attention without being uncomfortable. Flour is added to the browned meat and vegetable mixture to dry, thicken and loosely bind the filling. The meat filling can be used in other foods (e.g., tacos, tamales, enchiladas, stuffed bell pepper et al) but the wheat turnover crust is a defining element. The traditional size is approximately 4 ounces (by weight) on a 5\"-6\" diameter pastry dough (with the dough circles being cut, traditionally, using an empty coffee can). The filling should be made the day before to allow the flavors of the ingredients to meld. Filling, dough and tools should be chilled before assembly. Warm filling will cause the dough to disintegrate.\nIn the first part of the 20th century, meat pies were sold from home kitchens or from carts by street vendors. By 1967, Natchitoches meat pies were produced in commercial kitchens. Now, they may be ordered online.\nLouisiana Public Broadcasting aired a program January 20, 2007, describing how to make Natchitoches meat pies. It is available on DVD entitled \"A Taste of Louisiana with Chef John Folse & Company:  Our Food Heritage - The Spanish Shows\". An annual Meat Pie Festival, held in September, celebrates the Natchitoches meat pie. It includes pie making demonstrations, a meat pie cook-off, live music and more.\nCrawfish pie\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nPistolette\nLaws of Louisiana, LL 170.9, 2003.\n\"Report\". inside.sfuhs.org.\n\"Common Empanada Mistakes\".

Some Hot Browns also include ham with the turkey, and either pimentos or tomatoes over the sauce, and imitation Hot Browns sometimes substitute a commercial cheese sauce instead of the Mornay.

A Hot Brown sandwich (sometimes known as a Louisville Hot Brown or Kentucky Hot Brown) is an American hot sandwich originally created at the Brown Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky, by Fred K. Schmidt in 1926. It is a variation of traditional Welsh rarebit and was one of two signature sandwiches created by chefs at the Brown Hotel shortly after its founding in 1923. It was created to serve as an alternative to ham and egg late-night dinners.\nThe \"cold brown\" is baked poultry (chicken or turkey), hard-boiled egg, lettuce, and tomato open-faced on rye bread, and covered with Thousand Island dressing. It is rarely served anymore.\nIn St. Louis, the Prosperity Sandwich is a similar dish, with origins at the Mayfair Hotel in the 1920s. It is still served in the area today, and sometimes called a \"hot brown\".\nThe Turkey Devonshire, first served in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the 1930s, has been described as being similar to the Hot Brown.\nOn the Food Network, the Hot Brown was featured in an episode of Throwdown! with Bobby Flay. Joe and John Castro, chefs of the Brown Hotel in Kentucky, competed and won against Flay in a cook-off. It has also been featured on episodes of the network's shows The Rachael Ray Show and Southern Fried Road Trip. On the Travel Channel, the Hot Brown has been featured on the show Taste of America with Mark DeCarlo, a Louisville-themed episode of Man v. Food Nation and a 2018 episode of Food Paradise titled \"Sandwich Heroes\".\nOn PBS, the Hot Brown has been featured in the documentary Sandwiches That You Will Like as well as the program The Mind of a Chef, where Chef David Chang presented his interpretation of the sandwich.\nCuisine of Kentucky\nHistory of Louisville, Kentucky\nMelt sandwich\nList of American sandwiches\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nList of sandwiches\nKleber, John E.

Similar spreads are found in other countries  in the Balkan region, and bordering regions.\nZacusc\u0103 can be eaten as a relish or spread, typically on bread. It is said to improve in taste after some months of maturing but must be used within days of opening. Although traditionally prepared at home, it is also commercially available. Some Bulgarian and Middle Eastern brands are available in the United States. In the Orthodox Christian majority countries, it is sometimes eaten during fasting seasons due to the absence of meat, eggs or dairy products.\nThe word zacusc\u0103 is of Slavic origin which means simply \"appetizer\", \"breakfast\" or \"snack\" (see zakuska)\nAjvar, pindjur and ljutenica, similar spreads in Balkan cuisine\nKyopolou, a similar Bulgarian dish\nBiber sal\u00e7as\u0131, a Turkish paste made from red peppers alone\nList of eggplant dishes\nList of spreads\nZacusca on DEX Online Dictionary\nBasic zacusc\u0103 recipe.\nZacusca (recipe)",

Cendol /\u02c8t\u0283\u025bnd\u0252l/ is an iced sweet dessert that contains droplets of green rice flour jelly, coconut milk and palm sugar syrup. It is commonly found in Southeast Asia and is popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and Myanmar. Next to the green jelly, additional toppings might be added, including diced jackfruit, sweetened red azuki beans, or durian.\nEarliest written records of the word cendol or tjendol (Dutch spelling) can be traced to dictionaries and books of the 19th century in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). One of the oldest known records of the word tjendol is listed in the 1866 Oost-Indisch kookboek or East Indies recipe book. This book includes a cendol recipe with the title \"Tjendol of Dawet\" which indicates that cendol and dawet were already used synonymously at that time. In the dictionary Supplement op het Maleisch-Nederduitsch Woordenboek (1869) by Jan Pijnappel (Gz.), tjendol is described as a kind of drink or watery paste made from sago, coconut milk, sugar and salt.\nIn Malaya, the word \"chendol\" was first mentioned in 1932 as one of the foodstuffs available in Kuala Lumpur as recorded in the Malay Concordance Project that collects Malay writings.\nThere is a popular belief that the name \"cendol\" is related to, or originated from, the word jendol, in reference to the swollen green worm-like rice flour jelly; in Javanese, Sundanese, Indonesian, and Malay, jendol means \"bump,\" \"bulge,\" or \"swollen.\" In most parts of Indonesia, cendol refer to the green rice flour jelly; while the concoction of that green rice flour jellies with coconut milk, shaved ice, areca palm sugar and sometimes diced jackfruit is called es cendol (in West Java) or dawet (in Central and East Java).\nThe Indonesian dictionary Kamus Besar describes cendol as a snack made from rice flour and other ingredients that are formed by filters, then mixed with palm sugar and coconut milk (for beverage). The Malay dictionary Kamus Dewan similarly defines it as a porridge-like drink with long strands made of rice flour in coconut milk and sugar syrup.\nIn Vietnam, this worm-like rice flour concoction is called b\u00e1nh l\u1ecdt or \"fall through cake\". B\u00e1nh l\u1ecdt is a common ingredient in a Vietnamese dessert drink called ch\u00e8, or more commonly ch\u00e8 ba m\u00e0u. In Thailand it is called lot chong (Thai: \u0e25\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07, [l\u0254\u0302\u02d0t t\u0361\u0255\u02b0\u0254\u0302\u014b]) which can be translated as \"gone through a hole\", indicating the way it is made by pressing the warm dough through a sieve into a container of cold water. In Burma, it is known as mont let saung or \u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u101c\u1000\u103a\u1006\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1038. In Cambodia, it is known as lot (\u179b\u178f /l\u0254\u02d0t/), bang-aem lot (\u1794\u1784\u17d2\u17a2\u17c2\u1798\u179b\u178f /b\u0251\u014b\u0294a\u025bm l\u0254\u02d0t/), nom lot (\u1793\u17c6\u179b\u178f /n\u0277m l\u0254\u02d0t/), and banh lot (\u1794\u17b6\u1789\u17cb\u179b\u178f /ba\u0272 l\u0254\u02d0t/).\nThe origin of cendol is not clear, and this sweet drink is widely spread across Southeast Asia. However, one suggestion is that cendol originated in Java, Indonesia as dawet.  The Javanese name of \"dawet\" was recorded in early 19th century Javanese manuscript of Serat Centhini, composed between 1814 and 1823 in Surakarta, Central Java. An Indonesian academic suggests that a dawet sweet drink may have been recorded in the Kresnayana manuscript, dated from Kediri Kingdom circa 12th century Java. In Java, dawet refer to the whole concoction of cendol green jellies, usually made from aren sagoo or rice flour, coconut milk and liquid gula jawa (palm sugar syrup). An Indonesian historian argues that sagoo or rice flour might have been used as sweet beverage ingredient in the rice agriculture society of ancient Java. Indeed, cendol jellies and its variations are rural agricultural product, still traditionally produced in Javanese villages. In Banjarnegara, Central Java, dawet is traditionally served without ice. Today, however additional ice cubes or shaved ice is commonly added into this dessert drink. \nCendol, however, has developed differently in different countries.  In Indonesia, cendol only refers to the green \"pandan jelly served in coconut milk\", where sometimes pandanus leaves or pieces of jackfruit may be added. This is different to the cendol in Malaysia and Singapore where various ingredients such as sweetened red beans and sweet corn may be mixed in like an es campur.\nCendol is typically served with ice, and this may have developed when ice became readily available. It may have originated in Malayan",

Malawach or Melawwa\u1e25, (Hebrew: \u05de\u05dc\u05d5\u05d5\u05d7\u200e; literally means \"board-like bread\"), is a flatbread that is traditional in Yemenite Jewish cuisine. It was brought to Israel by Yemenite Jews. Malawach resembles a thick pancake but consists of thin layers of puff pastry brushed with oil or fat and cooked flat in a frying pan. It is traditionally served with hard-boiled eggs, zhug, and a crushed or grated tomato dip. Sometimes it is served with honey.\n\"The dough traditionally takes three days to make, since it is a multi-stage process, and the dough must rest in between each phase.\u201d\n\u2014\u2009Regev Eibenschutz\nMalawach is made from the same dough as jachnun, a Yemenite Jewish Shabbat bread, and both originated as a variation of hojaldre, a Sephardic Jewish puff pastry, brought to Yemen by Jews expelled from Spain. Hojaldre later became \"ajin\", an enriched dough only made by the Yemenite Jews, and was not made by the non-Jewish Yemenis, according to Rabbi Gil Marks, a Jewish food historian\nMalawach has historically been a staple of the Yemenite Jews. Through exodus of Yemenite Jews from Yemen in the mid-20th century, and their subsequent refuge in Israel, it has become a very popular dish in Israel, and a favorite comfort food for Israelis of all backgrounds and origins. Malawach is traditionally made at home by members of the Yemenite Jewish community, but with the newfound, widespread popularity of malawach in Israel in recent decades it is now commonly served at restaurants in Israel, many of which are dedicated to serving malawach, and related dishes such as jachnun. It is commonly used as a sandwich wrap similar to a laffa, and is commonly served with shakshouka, hummus, sabich, and many other dishes. It is also commonly served as a dessert with labneh and jam. It is also used as a pizza crust. Frozen malawah is commonly available in grocery stores across the nation, by brands such as Ta'amti, and Osem, and is exported abroad to kosher supermarkets in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and other nations. Frozen malawach can be used as a substitute for dough in different recipes such as bourekas, sambusak, and many others.\nYemenite Jewish cuisine\nIsraeli cuisine\nIsraeli culture\nSephardic Jewish cuisine\nJachnun\nKubaneh\nMarks, Rabbi Gil.

However, during World War I, the Battle of Li\u00e8ge took place, which lasted much longer than the German army had anticipated it would, caused a delay in German advances towards France in 1914, allowing the French to reorganize better. In order to honor the city of Li\u00e8ge for its resistance, and because the city was shelled with guns from Austria (an ally of the invading Germany during the war), Paris' caf\u00e9s started renaming the dessert from caf\u00e9 viennois to caf\u00e9 li\u00e9geois. In Li\u00e8ge itself, the dessert continued to be known as caf\u00e9 viennois for a while. and in Swiss French it remains only known as caf\u00e9 viennois.\nList of coffee dishes\n\u00a0Food portal\n\u00a0Coffee portal\n\"Caf\u00e9 li\u00e9geois with Homemade Coffee Ice Cream ~ a coffee and chocolate dessert\".

Pie \u00e0 la Mode was allegedly invented at the Cambridge Hotel in Cambridge, Washington County, New York, in the 1890s.\nThe claim is that while visiting the hotel, Charles Watson Townsend ordered a slice of apple pie with ice cream. When asked by another guest what he called the dish, he named it Pie \u00e0 la Mode. Townsend subsequently ordered it by that name every day during his stay. When he later ordered it by that name at Delmonico's Restaurant in New York City, the waiter responded that he had never heard of it. Townsend chastised the waiter by stating:\nDo you mean to tell me that so famous an eating place as Delmonico's has never heard of Pie \u00e0 la Mode, when the Hotel Cambridge, up in the village of Cambridge, NY serves it every day? Call the manager at once, I demand as good serve [sic] here as I get in Cambridge.\nThe manager, when called by the waiter, declared \"Delmonico's never intends that any other shall get ahead of it... Forthwith, pie \u00e0 la mode will be featured on the menu every day\". A reporter for the New York Sun newspaper overheard the disturbance and wrote an article about it the next day. Soon, Pie \u00e0 la Mode became a standard on menus around the United States.\nWhen Charles Watson Townsend died on May 20, 1936, a controversy developed as to who really invented Pie \u00e0 la Mode. The New York Times reported that \u201cPie \u00e0 la Mode\u201d was first invented by Townsend at the Cambridge Hotel in Cambridge, New York in the late 1800s. It was later reported by several sources that Townsend ordered pie and ice cream at the Cambridge Hotel in 1896, and thus invented the dessert. The legend also states that a reporter from The Sun newspaper in New York overheard a conversation between the manager of Delmonico's Restaurant and Charles Townsend. The reporter was said to have written about the incident in the very next issue of The Sun.\nA reporter from the St. Paul Pioneer Press read Townsend\u2019s obituary in the New York Times and considered that the Times had incorrectly attributed the invention of pie \u00e0 la mode to Townsend. The newspaper accordingly ran a story on May 23, 1936 about how the dessert was in fact invented inside a Superior Street restaurant in Duluth, Minnesota in the 1880s. The St. Paul newspaper indicated the Duluth restaurant specifically served ice cream with blueberry pie. This was over a decade before Townsend first ordered pie with ice cream in New York, making Duluth the true birthplace of pie \u00e0 la mode.\nA grand opening bill of fare for the Hotel la Perl was published in the March 26, 1885, issue of the Duluth Daily Tribune. The hotel was located at 501-503 West Superior Street in Duluth. The menu showed the hotel restaurant serving both vanilla ice cream and blueberry pie.\nThe owner of the hotel was John Gieriet. He was born in Tavetsch, Switzerland on February 6, 1829. He later moved to France where he learned to speak French. Gieriet moved to the United States in 1854. In 1856, Gieriet was put in charge of food service at the White House under the administration of President Franklin Pierce. He continued in that position into the late 1850s when he served under the administration of President James Buchanan.\nThe Gieriets moved to Duluth in 1885 and purchased the Commercial Hotel, which had been built in 1884 by William Dambruck. John re-named the building \u201cHotel La Perl.\u201d It was a large two-story wood-frame building with a flat roof. A saloon, that was located on the first floor, was converted into a restaurant and the rear laundry room was remodeled into a kitchen. On the Hotel la Perl\u2019s first day of business, Gieriet served up a fancy dinner that included French pickles, oysters, French peas, and Lake Superior trout. For dessert, he served warm blueberry pie and vanilla ice cream. Gieriet called the popular treat \u201cpie \u00e0 la mode.\u201d It was reported in the Duluth Herald that Duluthians in the 1880s often mispronounced the local invention as \u201cpylie mode.\u201d In 1886, the Duluth Weekly Tribune stated the Hotel la Perl had gained a \u201cfirst-class reputation\u201d under Gieriet's management. John continued to operate the Hotel la Perl until his wife became very ill in 1886. He ended up selling the hotel in August of that year.\nPie \u00e0 la mode wasn\u2019t John Gieriet\u2019s only invention. He received a United States patent for a railroad car ventilating apparatus on June 20, 1882. He also received a patent on October 30, 1899, for a type of fire escape. By 1910, Gieriet had moved to New York City, where he died on May 22, 1912, at the age of 83.\nList of pies, tarts and flans\nb\u0153uf \u00e0 la mode, a French dish similar to a pot roast\nThe Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, ed.

Maja de ube. Maja blanca has the consistency of thick gelatine and a delicate flavor, and is creamy white in color.\nThe dessert is the local Filipino adaptation of the Spanish dish manjar blanco (blancmange), but it has become distinct in that it uses very different ingredients, like coconut milk instead of milk or almond milk. The dish was most popular in Luzon, especially in Tagalog, Kapampangan, Pangasinense, and Ilocano cuisine. But it was also popular in the south, especially among Chavacano-speaking Zamboangue\u00f1os.\nMaja blanca takes its name from the flamboyant majas of 18th- and 19th-century Spanish society. Maja blanca is also known as dudul in Ilocano; as well as maja blanca con ma\u00edz, maja ma\u00edz, or maja blanca ma\u00edz when corn kernels are used in the preparation (ma\u00edz is Spanish for corn).\nMaja blanca is relatively easy to prepare. A coconut milk (not coconut cream) and cornstarch mixture is heated to boiling over a low flame while stirring. Agar (gulaman in Filipino) can be substituted for cornstarch. Corn kernels, milk, and sugar are also often added, though these are not traditionally part of the recipe. Once the mixture thickens, it is then poured into serving dishes previously greased with coconut oil and allowed to cool. Once firm, latik (browned coconut cream curds) are then sprinkled as toppings.\nIt is also often refrigerated and served cold to improve the texture.\nMaja blanca is similar in texture to panna cotta, but the flavor is different due to the coconut milk. \nThe corn kernels and latik are used to add different textures to the maja blanca, which, by itself, usually has a creamy texture.\nMaja blanca can easily be adapted to include various other ingredients, often resulting in changes in the color of the dish. Examples include squash maja blanca which uses calabazas (Filipino: kalabasa) and a version of maja maiz that uses butter, resulting in a distinctive yellow color.\nOther common variants include maja de ube (or maja ube), a deep purple variant of maja blanca which uses ube (purple yam); and maja buko pandan a light green variant which is flavored with pandan leaves and coconut meat.\nMaja blanca is prepared similarly with tibok-tibok without the corn kernels.\nEspasol\nHaupia\nLeche flan\nList of dishes using coconut milk\nManjar blanco\nManjar branco\nPhilippine cuisine\nSapin-sapin\nEdgie Polistico (2017).

Stick candy has been around since at least the fall of year 1837 when it was shown at the Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association alongside \"lobster candy\". Stick candy was popular with both children and adults in the U.S. as early as the 1860s, and the selling of this type of candy (particularly during the carnival season in the warmer months) was described as being lucrative. One contemporary account describes broken pieces of stick candy being sold in paper containers, being presented by candy sellers to rural people as something special, and commanding a high price.\nCandy sticks were the subject of an 1885 song called \"The Candy Stick\":\nOh the candy stick striped like a gay barber\u2019s pole,\nWas a luscious delight of my infantile soul,\nEv\u2019ry penny I earn\u2019d in my little palm burn\u2019d,\nTill away to the store on the corner I stole,\nFor the candy stick striped like a gay barber\u2019s pole.\nStick candy was the subject of a poem, \"Stick-Candy Days\", from the 1907 collection A Rose of the Old Regime: And other Poems of Home-Love and Childhood by the Bentztown Bard (Folger McKinsey). The first two verses are:\nI want to go back to the stick-candy days,\nBefore they made bonbons of choc'late and glaze;\nI want to go back to the dear little shop\nWhere the little old lady sold ginger-beer pop,\nAnd made little cookies with raisins, that went\nLike lightning because they were two for a cent!\nI know the green street where the little shop stood,\nAnd, oh, the stick-candy that tasted so good!\nLemon and wintergreen, cinnamon bar,\nEach in its round little, fat little jar\u2014\nI see through the glamor of childhood the glint\nOf the sassafras, horehound and white peppermint!\nStick candy is also mentioned in a 1909 poem, \"The Land of Candy\", by Madison Julius Cawein:\nFirst place that they came to, why,\nWas a wood that reached the sky;\nForest of Stick Candy. My!\nHow the little boy made it fly!\nWhy, the tree trunks were as great,\nBig around as, at our gate,\nAre the sycamores; the whole\nStriped like a barber's pole...\nStick candy is produced by mixing granulated sugar (and sometimes also corn syrup) with water and a small amount of cream of tartar. The dough is mixed with color and flavoring, then drawn and twisted, producing the characteristic spiral pattern, and finally cut to the proper length and allowed to cool and harden.\nIn the 1800s, bright red (and sometimes also bright blue) swirled with white were the most common colors. Although unbent and thicker, it is similar to a candy cane (which retains the aforementioned red-and-white color scheme).\nStick candy is produced in a wide assortment of flavors, such as root beer, sassafras, horehound, cinnamon, butterscotch, pi\u00f1a colada, peppermint, clove, spearmint, licorice, bubble gum, cotton candy, and wintergreen. They are also made in a wide variety of fruit and berry flavors. There are also varieties containing two different flavors swirled together.\nStick candy is generally sold shrink-wrapped in clear plastic, and traditionally displayed for sale in wide-mouthed glass jars.\nThey were originally sold by the piece for a nickel or dime. As of 2008 they more typically sell for 25 cents to 75 cents each, although they are also sold in bulk.\nSome varieties of stick candy are filled with sweet cream.\nAs a hard candy, stick candy is slow to dissolve and candy sticks last a very long time if consumed by sucking. As with lollipops, they are most often consumed by sucking, but may also be crushed by the teeth.\nStick candy is sometimes used as an ingredient in other foods: crushed and used in ice cream  pudding, or frosting, or cut into thin slices and used as a topping for cakes. It can also be used in other candy, particularly in combination with chocolate.\nLemon stick\nPolkagris\nRock candy\nRock (confectionery)\nDictionary of American Regional English by Frederic Gomes, p. 151.\nHarper's Magazine, v. 73 (June-November 1886), p. 94.\nCBRL Group, Inc.

There are many different sizes, colors, and shapes of arare.  Some are sweet, and others savory. One, called norimaki arare (nori meaning an edible seaweed in the form of a dried sheet; maki meaning roll shape) is wrapped with dried nori seaweed. Another, kaki no tane (\u67ff\u306e\u7a2e), takes its name from its resemblance to a persimmon seed. (Kaki is Japanese for \"persimmon\".) Kaki no tane are often sold with peanuts, a combination called kakip\u012b (\u304b\u304d\u30d4\u30fc). These are a popular snack to accompany Japanese beer.\nJapanese typically consume arare to celebrate the Doll Festival (Hinamatsuri), on March 3, Girls' Day in Japan. The arare made during the festival are very colorful - pink, yellow, white, brown, light green, and so on. Regular arare can be bought throughout the year, but the colorful ones are only available around January to March in anticipation of the Doll Festival.\nArare was brought to the U.S. by Japanese immigrants who came as plantation workers in the early 1900s. In Hawaii, the snack is often called kakimochi (fried rice paste). In Hawaii, it is popular to mix arare with popcorn (some people mix in furikake, too). The popular \"Hurricane popcorn\" includes both arare and furikake with the popcorn.

It is made of corn meal, water, salt, grated \"queso blanco\" (hard, salty, white cheese), sugar or panela (jaggery, used in most traditional recipes), and very ripe plantain.",

To create a sandwich loaf, bread is cut horizontally and spread with layers of filling. Common fillings include egg salad, chicken salad, ham salad, tuna salad, and Cheez Whiz, but other fillings are possible, including peanut butter and jelly and mock egg salad made from tofu. In a simple sandwich loaf, the fillings may all be the same, but in more complex creations each layer is different. White bread is usually used to create a sandwich loaf, but whole wheat is also used. Sometimes white and whole wheat are used in alternating layers to create a ribbon effect. ...",

It is likely that it was adapted from the \"Grilled Spamwich\", a recipe published in a Spam cookbook by Hormel in 1939 and brought to West Germany by American G.I.s. Spam was not available in Germany's grocery stores so Wilmenrod replaced it with a slice of cooked ham and Toast Hawaii was born.",

Pininyahang manok is made by first marinating the chicken in pineapple juice, though some recipes skip this part. The chicken is then fried in oil with garlic and onions until lightly browned. Water with a small amount of evaporated milk or condensed milk is then added, along with pineapple chunks, diced carrots, potatoes, and bell peppers. Coconut milk or cream can also be used in place of milk. It is spiced with salt, sugar, black pepper, or fish sauce to taste, and left to simmer at low heat until the ingredients are thoroughly cooked.\nThe dish spoils easily because of the milk or coconut milk ingredients. A common variant of the dish excludes them completely, and instead simply uses chicken stock as the base. Cornstarch may be added to thicken the sauce in this case.\nVienna sausages, hot dogs, cheese, eggs, or diced tomatoes may also be added along with the other ingredients. It is served on white rice and garnished with scallions and, sometimes, cashews.\nPininyahang manok is similar to the version of chicken afritada with pineapples, but the latter uses tomato sauce. It is also similar to chicken hamonado, but the latter uses soy sauce. Both of these similar dishes do not use milk.\nPininyahang hipon\nGinataan\nKare-kare\nList of chicken dishes\nSarsiado\nTinola\n\"Pininyahang Manok: Pineapple Chicken\". Asian Food Channel.

Depending on the region, they are traditionally filled with either ricotta cheese or egg custard. In some Italian-American communities, they are called pusties. Pasticciotti are approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) thick. They are typically served as a breakfast item, but may also be eaten throughout the day, and are a traditional pastry in Apulia.

An egg wash is often applied to the top of each pastry before baking.\nFillings for pasticciotti include the traditional lemon-flavored custard or ricotta, and variant fillings such as almond, chocolate, pistachio or vanilla custard; fruit preserves; or gianduja or Nutella chocolate-hazelnut spreads. An unusual variation filled with ground veal and almonds but topped with sugar, pasticciotti di carne, is a local favorite in the Sicilian town of Patti. Pasticciotti di carne are similar to the Moroccan pastilla which also combines a meat filling with a sugar topping. In Italy, custard-filled pasticciotti are the typical variety in Apulia,  particularly in the province of Lecce, where the city of Lecce named the pasticciotto its typical cake. The ricotta filling is more commonly seen in Sicily. In Naples, in southwestern Italy between Apulia and Sicily, custard fillings are common but the pasticciotto napoletano also includes cherries. Both custard and ricotta fillings can be found in the United States.\nThe invention of pasticciotti is credited to Andrea Ascalone, a chef in the town of Galatina in Lecce, who in 1745 used ingredients left over from full-sized tortas to create a smaller cake. The name pasticciotto allegedly comes from Ascalone himself regarding his creation as a pasticcio, or \"mishap\".\nHowever, recent studies demonstrate that the Ascalone family was not present in Galatina before 1787.\nIn southern Apulia, pasticciotti are sold in bakeries, bars, coffee shops and restaurants. They are also commonly available at Italian-American bakeries in the United States, alongside other Italian pastries such as cannoli and sfogliatelle.\nD'Imperio, Chuck (Apr 30, 2015). \"Pusties\".

                "description": "Szaloncukor (Slovak: salnka, plural salnky; literally: \"parlour candy\", Romanian: bomboane de pom) is a type of sweet traditionally associated with Christmas in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. It is a typical Hungarikum. It is usually made of fondant, covered by chocolate and wrapped in shiny coloured foil, then hung on the Christmas tree as decoration. Every year, almost a kilo and a half of it are consumed per household during Christmas season. The tradition of hanging these candies on the Christmas tree started in the 19th century. It was named szaloncukor because the tree usually stood in the parlour (szalon in Hungarian; Cukor means \"sugar\" or \"candy\"; in Slovak saln is \"parlour\" and -ka is diminutive suffix). ...",

The whole procedure was manual until the first fondant-machines have appeared. These were made by St\u00fchmer chocolate factory for the famous sweet-shop, Gerbaud. The last part of the procedure to be mechanized was the thrumming of the end of the paper cover. Considering that it has such a typical shape to keep, this part was not to be omitted.\nFondant candies originally came in a few flavours (vanilla and strawberry for example), but now there is a variety of candies, including jelly, coconut, hazelnut and many other flavors. It is usually hung on the tree with strings or small metal hooks. It is considered traditional on children's part, no matter how adults may frown, to empty all the wrappers on the tree before the season is out.\nThe earliest version of this fondant dessert emerged during the 14th century in France and was called fondantcukor. The recipe was altered through the years of European confectionery history. French pastry chef Pierre-Andre Manion in the 17th century introduced fondantcukor recipe in Germany.\nThe popularity of the fondant candies reached the shores of Hungary when German craftsmen migrated there in the 19th century. German wealthy families would erect Christmas trees in the entrance halls of their homes (called salons) and decorate them with sweets wrapped in shiny paper.\nSuch candies were made first in the 14th century in France. By the beginning of the 19th century it came through German intermediates to Hungary. In 1891, Hungarian-French chef and entrepreneur Hegyesi Joseph coined the name Szaloncukor which is derived from German fondant candy called \"Salonzuckerl\" which mean \"Sugar in Salons\".\nThe mass production of fondant candies wrapped in foil packaging was manufactured by steam-powered engines in 1883 in Hungary, mostly dedicated for creating traditional cakes of the Gerbeaud brand.\nFollowing Gerbeaud as inspiration, the family of Geza Kugler founded a chocolate factory in 1886. The Gerbeauds and Kuglers each adopted their own version of the recipe and published 19th-century recipe books of Hungarian confectionery. By the end of the 1800s, the candies were packed in tinfoil balls and colored tissue papers.\nIn 1941, the Kuglers opened the largest chocolate factory in Hungary.\nIn 1951 chocolate factory DEVA was founded in Trebi\u0161ov, Czechoslovakia (today Slovakia), which has been producing one of the best known chocolate Christmas candy in Slovakia, including \"parlour candy\" (sal\u00f3nky). Today, DEVA is brand owned by company ChocoSuc Partner s.r.o.\nChristmas trees\nPetr\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1, V\u011bra; Klaus, Ji\u0159\u00ed, edi.

The food is traditionally cooked by steaming the ingredients over layers of seaweed in a pit oven. The shellfish can be supplemented with vegetables, such as onions, carrots, and corn on the cob. Clambakes are usually held on festive occasions along the coast of New England.",

A typical clambake begins with gathering seaweed (traditionally rockweed \u2013 Ascophyllum nodosum) at the shoreline; seaweed is an important adjunct to cooking the food. To keep the seaweed fresh, it is necessary to have a container large enough to hold both the seaweed and a fair amount of sea water.\nAlso important are several round medium-sized stones, or sometimes cannonballs, which are heated in the fire and used to re-radiate heat during the cooking process.\nFinally, like most other methods of steaming, a cover is necessary to allow the trapped heat and steam to thoroughly cook the food. Canvas tarps or potato sacks soaked in sea water are often used for this purpose.\nOnce the stones and seaweed have been collected, a fire pit is prepared.  Some prefer to simply start a fire within the pit, while others line the edges with flat stones to provide support for a metal grill on which the stones may be placed.\nThe stones used for cooking are then placed in the center of the pit and a wood fire is started, although the exact method of heating the stones varies. The fire must burn until the stones are glowing hot. Care must be taken to ensure that the fire will burn out shortly after this optimal cooking temperature is achieved. The ashes are then swept off the stones and raked between them to form an insulating \"bed.\" A layer of wet seaweed is placed over the stones, followed by traditional regional foods such as steamers, mussels, quahogs, and lobsters. Side dishes usually include corn on the cob, potatoes, carrots, and onions. Alternating layers of seaweed and food are piled on top and the entire mound is covered with canvas that has been drenched in water to seal in the heat and prevent the canvas from burning. The food is allowed to steam for several hours.\nSince many locales outlaw building fires on beaches, and in order to accommodate the dish in homes or backyards, this dish is often prepared in a large pot. This is known as a New England clam boil. Some caterers specialize in clambakes on the beach.\nClambakes are also popular in Greater Cleveland, despite that region's not being near the Atlantic Ocean. A typical clambake there includes a dozen clams with half a chicken, sweet potatoes, corn, and other side dishes.  Seaweed is not used and the clams, chicken, and sweet potatoes are all steamed together in a large pot. John D.

Originally called Tea Biscuits, they were developed in the 17th century in Yorkshire, England for the upper classes as a light snack between full-course meals. One of the best-selling biscuits in the British Isles, the biscuit is also popular in Malta and Cyprus. The plain flavour and consistency of rich tea makes them particularly suitable for dunking in tea and coffee. McVitie's have used the brand name \"Rich Tea\" since 1891 and remains the best-known manufacturer in the UK. Since 2000, most major supermarkets sell an own-brand version of the biscuits. ...",

Poppy seed paste, also known as mohn is a common ingredient in Jewish pastries and desserts, and is made from ground poppy seeds and additional sweeteners. Examples of pastries featuring the filling include mohn kichel, babka, and, most famously, hamantashen. In Jewish cuisine, the filling is traditionally referred to as mohn, the word for poppy in both Yiddish and German. Poppy seed-filled pastries are particularly associated with the holiday of Purim\nPoppy seed paste generally has a very thick, paste-like consistency similar to peanut butter or a thick custard, which can grow hard during cooking. It is typically sweet but has been said to have a subtle bitterness and citrus notes due to the poppy seeds. Sometimes lemon or orange zest is added to further accentuate these notes. As the poppy seeds have been ground to a powdery consistency, they have less of a tendency to get stuck in people's teeth than whole poppy seeds.\nIn Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, there are two main kinds of poppy seed filling used in order to accommodate kosher dietary laws. Dairy mohn, which may contain milk, heavy cream, and/or butter; and which is used in baked goods such as hamantaschen which are made with a dough containing dairy and which will be served with a dairy meal. And pareve (non-dairy) poppy seed filling which typically replaces the milk with water and the butter with margarine or oil, and is used in pastries that are meant to be served with meat meals such as mohn rolls, pareve hamantaschen, etc. Pareve poppy seed filling is also suitable for vegan recipes.\nPoppy seeds were one of the most popular spices in medieval Central Europe, known as mohn in German and Yiddish and m\u00e1k in Hungarian.\nTraditionally, poppy seed filling was almost exclusively prepared at home. Immigrants brought poppy seeds to the United States, with the first recipes for poppy seed cookies attested as early as 1889 in cookbooks published by German-Jewish immigrants. Beginning in the 20th century, various commercially-made canned varieties by brands such as \"Solo\" became available and are still sold online and in grocery stores in areas of the United States with significant Jewish populations such as the Northeast, Southern California, and South Florida. Homemade and premade renditions have significant differences in ingredients, and premade filling is generally dairy-free. Some assert that homemade filling is of superior quality as packaged poppy seed filling often contains ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup, and preservatives.\nPastries featuring poppy seed filling are associated with holidays in several cultures. In Ashkenazi Jewish culture, poppy seed-filled hamantashen (translated as \"Haman's ears\" or \"Haman's pockets\") are a traditional pastry eaten during Purim, and are one of the most well-known uses of poppy seed filling.\nIn Hungary, a Poppy seed roll (Bejgli) is made for Christmas.\n\"poppy seed filling for cookies and pastries\".

A corn dog (also spelled corndog) is a sausage (usually a hot dog) on a stick that has been coated in a thick layer of cornmeal batter and deep fried. It originated in the United States and is commonly found in American cuisine.\nNewly arrived German immigrants in Texas, who were sausage-makers finding resistance to the sausages they used to make, have been credited with introducing the corn dog to the United States, though the serving stick came later.  A US patent filed in 1927, granted in 1929, for a Combined Dipping, Cooking, and Article Holding Apparatus, describes corn dogs, among other fried food impaled on a stick; it reads in part:\nI have discovered that articles of food such, for instance, as wieners, boiled ham, hard boiled eggs, cheese, sliced peaches, pineapples, bananas and like fruit, and cherries, dates, figs, strawberries, etc., when impaled on sticks and dipped in batter, which includes in its ingredients a self rising flour, and then deep fried in a vegetable oil at a temperature of about 390\u00a0\u00b0F [200\u00a0\u00b0C], the resultant food product on a stick for a handle is a clean, wholesome and tasty refreshment.\nA \"Krusty Korn Dog\" baker machine appeared in the 1926 Albert Pick-Barth wholesale catalog of hotel and restaurant supplies. The 'korn dogs' were baked in a corn batter and resembled ears of corn when cooked.\nA number of current corn dog vendors claim responsibility for the invention and/or popularization of the corn dog. Carl and Neil Fletcher lay such a claim, having introduced their \"Corny Dogs\" at the State Fair of Texas sometime between 1938 and 1942.  The Pronto Pup vendors at the Minnesota State Fair claim to have invented the corn dog in 1941.  Cozy Dog Drive-in, in Springfield, Illinois, claims to have been the first to serve corn dogs on sticks, on June 16, 1946. Also in 1946, Dave Barham opened the first location of Hot Dog on a Stick at Muscle Beach in Santa Monica, California.\nOne cheesy variation is prepared either with melted cheese between the hot dog and the breading or by using a cheese-filled hot dog.\nAnother version is the \"cornbrat\" (or \"corn brat\"), which is a corn dog made with bratwurst instead of a wiener or hot dog. They are also sold using different meats in the dog, such as pork and turkey.\nSmall corn dogs, known as \"corn puppies\", \"mini corn dogs\", or \"corn dog nuggets\", are a variation served in some restaurants, generally on the children's menu or at fast food establishments. A serving includes multiple pieces, usually 10. In contrast to their larger counterparts, corn puppies are normally served stickless as finger food.\nA breakfast version of the corn dog features a breakfast sausage in place of the hot dog, and pancake batter in place of the cornmeal. This variation is commonly called a \"pancake on a stick\". It was formerly served by the drive-in restaurant Sonic, but now is made by companies such as Jimmy Dean.\nBoth vegetarian corn dogs and corn dog nuggets are made as meatless alternatives by many of the same companies that produce vegetarian hot dogs.\n\nIn Argentina, a panchuker (or panchuque, pancho chino) is a hot snack that can be bought near some train stations and in some places of heavy pedestrian transit. They are more popular in the inner country cities. A panchuker consists of a sausage covered with a waffle-like pastry, and has a stick in it (like a corn dog) so that it can be easily consumed. Some versions contain cheese, and sauces may be served to accompany them. Some variations may be found in Uruguay and other South American countries. Generally, panchukers are offered as a low-price fast food and can only be seen at certain provinces of the inner country, like La Plata, Belgrano, Villa Albertina, Cipoletti, and in Buenos Aires they can be found in Barrio Chino. They are particularly popular in the province of Tucum\u00e1n.\nIn Australia, a hot dog sausage on a stick, deep fried in batter, is known as a Dagwood Dog, Pluto Pup, or Dippy Dog, depending on region.  Variants use wheat-based or corn-based batters. These are not to be confused with the Australian battered sav, a saveloy deep fried in a wheat flour-based batter, as used for fish and chips, which generally does not contain cornmeal.\nIn Quebec, a battered hot dog on a stick is called a \"pogo\" and is traditionally eaten with ordinary, yellow mustard, sometimes referred to as \"ballpark mustard\". The rest of Canada refers to them by the non-trademarked term \"corn dog\" It is named after the trademarked name of a Conagra inc. frozen product available in all of the country since the 1960s but whose main market is the province of Quebec.\nA New Zealand Hot Dog is invariably a deep fried battered sausage on a stick that is dipped in tomato ketchup.

According to oral history, the plant and the jelly were named after the daughter of a Taiwanese tea businessman in the 1800s. The gelling property of the seeds was discovered by the businessman as he drank from a creek in Chiayi. He found a clear yellowish jelly in the water he was drinking and was refreshed upon trying it. Looking above the creek he noticed fruits on hanging vines. The fruits contained seeds that exuded a sticky gel when rubbed.\nUpon this discovery, he gathered some of the fruits and served them at home with honeyed lemon juice or sweetened beverages. Finding the jelly-containing beverage delicious and thirst-quenching, the enterprising businessman delegated the task of selling it to his beautiful 15-year-old daughter, Aiyu. The snack was very well received and became highly popular. So, the businessman eventually named the jelly and the vines after his daughter.\nHowever, the Austronesian name igos, coming from Spanish higo, hints at a possible Austronesian origin for this food.\nFruits of the creeping fig plant resemble large fig fruits the size of small mangos. The figs grow from flowers pollinated by the Wiebesia pumilae. and are harvested from September through January just before the fruit ripens to a dark purple. The fruits are then halved and turned inside out to dry over the course of several days. The dry fruits can be sold as is, or dried aiyu seeds (Chinese: \u611b\u7389\u5b50; pinyin: aiyu zi) can then be pulled off the skin and sold separately.\nThe aiyu seeds are placed in a cotton cloth bag, and the bag and its contents are submerged in cold water and rubbed. A slimy gel will be extracted from the bag of aiyu seeds as it is squeezed and massaged. This is known as \"washing aiyu\" in Chinese (\u6d17\u611b\u7389). After several minutes of massaging and washing, no more of the yellowish tea-coloured gel will be extracted, and the contents of the bag are discarded. The washed gel is then allowed to set into a jelly either in a cool location or in the refrigerator. One must keep in mind certain things when making aiyu jelly or else the gel may not set:\nThere must not be any grease in the container or water used to wash or set the gel,\nSugar must not be added to the aiyu prior to the setting of the gel,\nDistilled water must not be used since the gelling depends on the presence of minerals in the water,\nDuring washing, the seeds must not be rubbed so hard as to rupture their shells.\nWater will slowly seep out of the jelly some time after it sets, and it will turn back to a liquid over the course of several days.\nThe jelly is usually served with honey and lemon juice but can also be included in other sweetened beverages or shaved ice and is particularly popular as a cool drink in hot summers.\nThe gelling agent in aiyu seeds is pectin. Pectines are located in the transparent layer on the surface of seeds and not the inside of seeds, which is why they are extracted by washing and rubbing instead of grounding to a powder. The main component of the water extract was found to be LMP (low methoxy pectin), as opposed to high metoxy pectins prevalent in commercially used sources such as apples or citrus peels. LMP gels in presence of divalent cations, which are found in sufficient amount in water (when it's not distilled), thus causing a creation of jelly.\nTaiwanese cuisine\nNight markets in Taiwan\nGrass jelly\nGelatin dessert\nO-aew, a variant of aiyu jelly found in Phuket, Thailand\nBingfen\n\"Entry #12372\". \u81fa\u7063\u95a9\u5357\u8a9e\u5e38\u7528\u8a5e\u8fad\u5178 [Dictionary of Frequently-Used Taiwan Minnan].

The jelly is not commonly made or found outside of Taiwan and Singapore, though it can be bought fresh in specialty stores in Japan and canned in Chinatowns. It is also used in Taiwanese cuisine. In Cantonese, it is also known as wan tau long (). It is commonly served with a slice of lime.",

According to oral history, the plant and the jelly were named after the daughter of a Taiwanese tea businessman in the 1800s. The gelling property of the seeds was discovered by the businessman as he drank from a creek in Chiayi. He found a clear yellowish jelly in the water he was drinking and was refreshed upon trying it. Looking above the creek he noticed fruits on hanging vines. The fruits contained seeds that exuded a sticky gel when rubbed.\nUpon this discovery, he gathered some of the fruits and served them at home with honeyed lemon juice or sweetened beverages. Finding the jelly-containing beverage delicious and thirst-quenching, the enterprising businessman delegated the task of selling it to his beautiful 15-year-old daughter, Aiyu. The snack was very well received and became highly popular. So, the businessman eventually named the jelly and the vines after his daughter.\nHowever, the Austronesian name igos, coming from Spanish higo, hints at a possible Austronesian origin for this food.\nFruits of the creeping fig plant resemble large fig fruits the size of small mangos. The figs grow from flowers pollinated by the Wiebesia pumilae. and are harvested from September through January just before the fruit ripens to a dark purple. The fruits are then halved and turned inside out to dry over the course of several days. The dry fruits can be sold as is, or dried aiyu seeds (Chinese: \u611b\u7389\u5b50; pinyin: aiyu zi) can then be pulled off the skin and sold separately.\nThe aiyu seeds are placed in a cotton cloth bag, and the bag and its contents are submerged in cold water and rubbed. A slimy gel will be extracted from the bag of aiyu seeds as it is squeezed and massaged. This is known as \"washing aiyu\" in Chinese (\u6d17\u611b\u7389). After several minutes of massaging and washing, no more of the yellowish tea-coloured gel will be extracted, and the contents of the bag are discarded. The washed gel is then allowed to set into a jelly either in a cool location or in the refrigerator. One must keep in mind certain things when making aiyu jelly or else the gel may not set:\nThere must not be any grease in the container or water used to wash or set the gel,\nSugar must not be added to the aiyu prior to the setting of the gel,\nDistilled water must not be used since the gelling depends on the presence of minerals in the water,\nDuring washing, the seeds must not be rubbed so hard as to rupture their shells.\nWater will slowly seep out of the jelly some time after it sets, and it will turn back to a liquid over the course of several days.\nThe jelly is usually served with honey and lemon juice but can also be included in other sweetened beverages or shaved ice and is particularly popular as a cool drink in hot summers.\nThe gelling agent in aiyu seeds is pectin. Pectines are located in the transparent layer on the surface of seeds and not the inside of seeds, which is why they are extracted by washing and rubbing instead of grounding to a powder. The main component of the water extract was found to be LMP (low methoxy pectin), as opposed to high metoxy pectins prevalent in commercially used sources such as apples or citrus peels. LMP gels in presence of divalent cations, which are found in sufficient amount in water (when it's not distilled), thus causing a creation of jelly.\nTaiwanese cuisine\nNight markets in Taiwan\nGrass jelly\nGelatin dessert\nO-aew, a variant of aiyu jelly found in Phuket, Thailand\nBingfen\n\"Entry #12372\". \u81fa\u7063\u95a9\u5357\u8a9e\u5e38\u7528\u8a5e\u8fad\u5178 [Dictionary of Frequently-Used Taiwan Minnan].

The first Westerner to report of nam phrik was Simon de la Loub\u00e8re, a French ambassador to the court of Ayutthaya. In 1687\u201388 he noted that it contains \"a mustard like sauce, which consisted of crayfish corrupted (fermented fish); which they called kapi.\" King Chulalongkorn, regarded as one of the greatest kings of Thailand, repeatedly stated during his tour of Europe in 1907 that, besides khai chiao (omelette), he most missed nam phrik. The chef David Thompson, an acknowledged expert on Thai cuisine, writes, \"They are at the very core of Thai cooking and have fed the Thai from their distant past to the present.\"\nChili peppers originated in the Americas, where they have been cultivated for over 6,000 years. They were probably introduced to Asia, and Thailand, in the 16th century by Portuguese emissaries and traders in what is known as the Columbian Exchange. Before chili peppers were known and enthusiastically embraced in Thai cuisine, other spices such as black pepper, long pepper, and Sichuan pepper were used instead to achieve the desired \"spiciness\".\nTypes of nam phrik vary according to the ingredients, the preparation and the region. Some may include tamarind, green mango, galangal, lemongrass, and/or mushrooms and even ingredients such as frog. If fish paste is used, it may be made in a variety of ways, by mincing dried, boiled, grilled or salted fish, or by using fish roe. In Isan, pla ra, giving an intense flavor, is often used. Some types of nam phrik may be sweetened with sugar. A Thai cook book from 1974 lists over 100 different recipes. Among the most widespread varieties, the following deserve mention:\nNam phrik kapi (Thai: \u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e01\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e34) is one of the most widespread varieties and is typical of central Thailand. It contains fermented shrimp paste, lime, chilies, and often pea eggplant. It is often eaten with fried pla thu and vegetables, among other dishes.\nNam phrik kha (Thai: \u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e02\u0e48\u0e32) is made with roasted chilies, garlic, galangal and salt.

A Mont Blanc (or Mont-Blanc aux marrons, in Italian, Monte Bianco) is a dessert of sweetened chestnut pur\u00e9e in the form of vermicelli, topped with whipped cream. It was created in nineteenth-century Piedmont, in Italy. The name comes from Mont Blanc, as the dish resembles a snow-capped mountain.\nMont Blanc has been an autumn and winter favorite at many Parisian p\u00e2tisseries, notably the Parisian tea shop Angelina, where it has been a specialty since it opened in 1903. For a long time considered old-fashioned and heavy, it has become newly popular in the 2010s in a lighter form at trendy shops like Pierre Herm\u00e9, with many variations.\nMont Blanc is popular in France, Italy, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Japan, Slovakia, Switzerland, Hungary, and northwestern Romania.\nChestnut pur\u00e9es have a long history as a soup, porridge, or side dish for meats, especially in regions where chestnuts are a staple food. However, these dishes are not desserts, and are not served with whipped cream. Even a Swiss or German recipe of whole chestnuts cooked with cream and butter and seasoned with cinnamon is treated as a savory dish in 1844.\nThe Mont Blanc has three distinctive characteristics: it is sweet, it is made of chestnut pur\u00e9e in the form of vermicelli served as a mount or a ring, and it is heaped with whipped cream.\nA sweet dessert of pur\u00e9ed chestnuts passed through a sieve to make vermicelli shapes\u2014but without the characteristic whipped cream of the Mont Blanc\u2014is called in various French cookbooks starting in 1842 (compote de) marrons en vermicelle.\nA dish called entremets du Mont-Blanc or simply montblanc, described as a sweet combination of chestnuts and cream, is said to have been invented by the Dessat(s) pastry-shop by 1847. Sources do not specify exactly how it was prepared, but it was said to be \"a true monument which will make his name immortal, that is, a dish that all mouths will praise\".\nAn unambiguous reference to the Mont Blanc is a dish of pur\u00e9ed chestnuts topped with whipped cream documented in 1885, called torche aux marrons, and considered an Alsatian dish. That recipe does not specify that the chestnuts are formed into vermicelli, but an 1892 article does, and clearly says that torche is the Alsatian name for what is called Mont Blanc in southern France. The same dish is also called marrons chantilly in 1889.\nThe dish with whipped cream and the name Mont-Blanc aux marrons appears in 1888, 1889, and 1893, and then in Escoffier's Guide Culinaire in 1903, with the advice to pile the whipped cream up irregularly to imitate a rugged mountain.\nAccording to the Mont-Blanc (Monburan) pastry shop in Tokyo, Mont Blanc was introduced to Japan in 1933, inspired by the Mont Blanc of Angelina in Paris. That shop used chestnuts preserved in syrup, which were yellow.\nIt has been claimed that the dessert was described in Platina's De Honesta Voluptate in 1475, and that a recipe is found in Scappi's Opera in 1570, but no such recipe appears in these writings. It is also claimed that it arrived in France from Italy in 1620, but no evidence is given for this.\nThe chestnut pur\u00e9e may be formed in a mold rather than into vermicelli shapes, though this tends to make the dish heavier. This may be what was called \"timbale de marrons, Chantilly\" on an 1868 menu.\nThe original version served multiple diners, but the p\u00e2tisserie version today is often an individual serving.\nIn France, it is sometimes presented on a meringue or biscuit bottom. It may be flavored or garnished with chocolate, rose syrup, berries, and so on.\nVariations include using chestnuts in the meringue or biscuit base, with no pur\u00e9e.\nEscoffier also describes a Mont-Blanc aux fraises, essentially whipped cream studded with fraises des bois, with no chestnuts at all, the name referring to its shape.\nA simplified version mixes cr\u00e8me de marrons with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and serves it in a bowl, with no \"mountain\".\nTraditional patisseries in Shanghai often have chestnut vermicelli cut into short bits, and laid atop a base of sponge cake, the thickness of which may vary. Shanghainese chestnut Mont Blanc also feature a heavy unwhipped cream topping and may be served in cups. Such style is said to have been created by a German pastry chef at the city\u2019s first European patisserie, Kaisiling, and over time it has become a Shanghainese staple under the unassuming name \u201cli zi dan gao\u201d or chestnut cake. \nIn Japan, sometimes pumpkin, squash, and purple yam are used instead of chestnuts, and along with chestnuts, sometimes cocoa or matcha are added. There are also fruit Mont Blanc, with flavors such as mango and strawberry. In fact, all they have in common with the original is being made of a pur\u00e9e formed into vermicelli shapes.\nMarron glac\u00e9\nList of desserts\nLucile Escourrou, \"Le Mont Blanc\u00a0: ce grand",

Several times in succession, the dough is folded and rolled out thinly, and coated with butter. As soon as the dough is sufficiently outstretched to a filmy layer, it is moistened with a little water, sprinkled with a melange of sugar and cinnamon and finally rolled up. In order to provide the filled dough roll with the typical shape of a Franzbrtchen, it has to be cut into slices, each about four centimetres thick. Afterwards, the pieces are pressed together in the middle of the cut faces with the handle of a wooden spoon, which causes the filling to ooze out sideways. ...",

A Franzbr\u00f6tchen ([\u02c8f\u0281ants\u02ccb\u0281\u00f8\u02d0t\u00e7\u025bn]) is a small, sweet pastry baked with butter and cinnamon, similar to a cinnamon roll. Sometimes other ingredients are used as well, such as chocolate or raisins. It is a type of pastry commonly found in northern Germany, especially Hamburg, and it is usually served for breakfast, but is also enjoyed along with coffee and cake. As its name indicates, the Franzbr\u00f6tchen was probably inspired by French pastries. Originally, it could be found only in the region of Hamburg, but now Franzbr\u00f6tchen are also sold in Bremen, Berlin, and other German cities.\nThe Franzbr\u00f6tchen was probably named in the style of the French (German 'franz\u00f6sisch') model, the croissant, which is also made of pastry and became popular in Germany after Napoleon's troops had occupied Hamburg between 1806 and 1814. According to a different historical tradition, they produced a longish Franzbrot (German for 'French bread') which resembled the baguette. Legend has it, a baker in Hamburg had once seared such a Franzbrot in a pan of fat, which is considered the origin of the contemporary Franzbr\u00f6tchen.\nList of German desserts\nCinnamon Roll\n\"Happi, Happi - Mors, Mors\".

Knafeh (Arabic: \u0643\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0629\u200e) is a traditional Middle Eastern dessert made with spun pastry called kataifi, soaked in sweet, sugar-based syrup, and typically layered with cheese, or with other ingredients such as clotted cream, pistachio or nuts, depending on the region. It is popular in the Arab world, particularly Egypt and the Levant, being considered the most representative and iconic Palestinian dessert. Variants are also found in Turkey, Greece, and the Balkans.\nIn Arabic, the name may refer to the string pastry itself, or to the entire dessert dish. In Turkish, the string pastry is known as tel kaday\u0131f, and the cheese-based dessert that uses it as k\u00fcnefe. In the Balkans, the shredded dough is similarly known as kadaif, and in Greece as kataifi, and is the basis of various dishes rolled or layered with it, including dessert pastries with nuts and sweet syrups.\nOne of the most well-known preparations of the dessert is \"Knafeh Nabulsiyeh\", which originated in the city of Nablus, and is the most representative and iconic Palestinian dessert. Knafeh Nabulsiyeh uses a white-brine cheese called Nabulsi. It is prepared in a large round shallow dish, the pastry is colored with orange food coloring, and sometimes topped with crushed pistachio nuts.\nThe English language borrows the word from Levantine and Egyptian Arabic, and widely transliterates it as kanafeh, kenafeh, knafeh, kunafah, kunafeh, konafa, kunafa, and similar variations. Its form in Arabic, \u0643\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0629, renders as kn\u0101fa when transliterated.\nThe ultimate origin of kanafeh is debated. Some sources state that it comes from the Coptic Egyptian word kenephiten, meaning a bread or cake. Early attestations are found in Egyptian stories in Alf layla\u1e97 wa-layla\u1e97, the One Thousand and One Nights. Another view is that it comes from a Semitic root with a meaning of \"side\" or \"wing\", from the Arabic kanafa, \"to flank or enclose\".\nAccording to etymologist Sevan Ni\u015fanyan, the Turkish term tel kaday\u0131f\u0131 (\"string-pancake\" or \"string-cr\u00eape\"), referring to the vermicelli-like pastry often used in kanafeh and other dishes, is based on the Arabic word qatayif (a pancake or cr\u00eape). It appears in 1501 in a Turkish-Persian dictionary.\nA common story is that the dish was created, and prescribed by doctors, to satisfy the hunger of caliphs during Ramadan. The story is variously said to have happened in Fatimid Egypt, or in the Umayyad Caliphate in Syria. It is also reported to have been mentioned in writing as early as the 10th century, and to be of Fatimid origin. However, dishes mentioned in historical texts are not necessarily the same as the modern versions of kanafeh.\nIbn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th century Kitab al-Tabikh (Book of Dishes), a collection of Arabic and Persian recipes and food advice of the Abbasid caliphs, mentions neither the word kun\u0101fa, nor a description of the dish as it is known today. However, it does feature a chapter on desserts made with the related qat\u0101yif, meaning cr\u00eapes, from which the Turkish word kaday\u0131f and Greek word kata\u00effi derive. In one recipe, qat\u0101yif are stuffed with nuts, deep-fried, and topped with honey-sugar syrup, which is essentially unchanged in today's version. Also described are large thin cr\u00eapes resembling fabric, called ruq\u0101q, cooked on a round sheet of metal called a t\u0101baq, layered with fruit, and drenched with sugar.\nThe 13th century anonymous Kitab al tabikh fi-l-Maghrib wa-l-Andalus (Book of Dishes from Mahgreb and Al-Andalus) uses the word 'kun\u0101fa' to describe a cr\u00eape made with thin batter on an Indian pan or \"mirror\" (the t\u0101baq), and says it is equivalent to ruq\u0101q. It also gives a recipe for Abbasid Qat\u0101yif (the cr\u00eapes being called musahhada in Al-Andalus), which uses the same batter, but the kun\u0101fa is made thinner, \"like a fine tissue\". It gives a number of dessert recipes for kun\u0101fa, where the cr\u00eapes are served layered with fresh cheese, baked, and topped with honey and rose syrup; or cut up into shreds like rose leaves and cooked with honey, nuts, sugar, and rosewater.\nIbn al-Jazari gives an account of a 13th-century market inspector who rode through Damascus at night, ensuring the quality of kun\u0101fa, qat\u0101'if, and other foods associated with Ramadan, during the Mamluk period.\nIn the later Middle Ages, a new technique was created, with thin batter being dripped onto the metal sheet from a perforated container, creating hair-like strings. A mid-15th century Ottoman Turkish translation of Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi's Kitab al-Tabikh added several new contemporary recipes, including one for this kadayif, though it does not specify where it originated.

These layers are repeated up to the top of the dish when a final dollop of cream and sprinkling of the rye crumbs are added to enhance the dessert's appearance.

Ka'\u00ed Ladrillo is a typical dessert of the Paraguayan cuisine prepared mainly with peanuts and molasses.\nThe name ka\u2019i ladrillo is the result of the combination of two words, \u201cka\u2019i\u201d that means \u201cmonkey\u201d and \u201cladrillo\u201d that is brick, used to refer to all things with that shape. So the \u201cka\u2019i ladrillo\u201d is the \u201cbrick of the monkey\u201d because it is usually made with a rectangular form like a brick and because the monkey (ka\u2019i mirikina) is an animal natural of the Paraguayan jungles that likes to eat everything that is sweet. And this dessert is especially sweet. It is also called \u201cazukap\u00e9 manduv\u00ed\u201d, Guaran\u00ed words for \u201csugar\u201d (azuk\u00e1), \u201cflat\u201d (p\u00e9) and \u201cpeanut\u201d (manduv\u00ed).\nTo prepare the ka\u2019i ladrillo are needed: toast peanuts and molasses. Some varieties of the dish also include a little of sour orange or grapefruit juice, which give it a bittersweet taste and diminishes the excessive sweetness.\nCarlos Villagra Marsal (1999).

Chikki is a traditional Indian sweet (brittle) generally made from nuts and jaggery/sugar. There are several different varieties of chikki in addition to the most common groundnut (peanut) chikki. Each variety of chikki is named after the ingredients used, which include puffed or roasted Bengal gram, sesame, puffed rice, beaten rice, or khobra (desiccated coconut), and other nuts such as almonds, cashews and pistachios. \nIn regions of North India, especially Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, this sweet is called layiya patti. In Sindh and Sindhi regions of India, it is called layee or lai and in other north Indian states, it is also known as gajak or maroonda. In Bangladesh, West Bengal and other Bengali-speaking regions, it is known as gur badam. In the South Indian states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, it is called palli patti. In Kerala it is called Kappalandi muthai. In Tamil Nadu it is called kadalai mittai. Similar dishes are also very popular in Brazil, where it is known as p\u00e9-de-moleque, and in Paraguay, where it is called ka'i ladrillo.\nThe preparation of chikkis consists of first preparing the hot jaggery syrup with a minimum of water, adding nuts to the syrup to coat them (with the syrup) and then transferring the nuts to a wooden mould, then rolling them to a thickness of about 6\u20138\u00a0mm using a wooden roller, then placing into a steel plate for cooling, cutting into slabs, and packing. In homes, smaller quantities are hand rolled with wooden rollers.\nMost popular chikkis are sourced from the Indian towns of Bhuj in Gujarat;  Kovilpatti in Tamil Nadu; Standard Cold Pressed Oil Madurai, Palakkad , Central Travancore, Kannur, Cherthala in Kerala, Lonavala, Matheran, Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani, and Karjat in Maharashtra.\nGajak, a similar candy with sesame seeds\nKovilpatti\nLonavala chikki\nPeanut brittle, a similar candy with a lower proportion of nuts\nGozinaki\nList of peanut dishes\nTameletjie\nAlegr\u00eda (Mexican candy)\nP\u00e9-de-moleque\nChitrodia, Rucha Biju. \"A low-cal twist to sweet sensations\".

Ptitim is a rice-grain-shaped pasta developed in the 1950s in Israel as a substitute for rice.\nOrzo is often boiled in Italian soups, like minestrone.

Rice has been grown in southern Italy since the 14th century, and its cultivation eventually reached Milan in the north. While according to a legend, a young glassblower's apprentice of the Fabbrica del Duomo di Milano from Flanders, who used to use saffron as a pigment, added it to a rice dish at a wedding feast, the first recipe identifiable as risotto dates from 1809. It includes rice saut\u00e9ed in butter, sausages, bone marrow, onions with hot broth with saffron gradually added. There is a recipe for a dish named as a risotto in the 1854 Trattato di cucina ('Treatise on Cooking') by Giovanni Vialardi, assistant chief chef to kings. However, the question of who invented the risotto in Milan remains unanswered today.\nThe rice varieties now associated with risotto were developed in the 20th century, starting with Maratelli in 1914.\nA high-starch (amylopectin), low-amylose round medium- or short- grain white rice is usually used for making risotto. Such rices have the ability to absorb liquids and to release starch and so they are stickier than the long grain varieties. The principal varieties used in Italy are Arborio, Baldo, Carnaroli, Maratelli, Padano, Roma, and Vialone Nano. Carnaroli, Maratelli (historical Italian variety) and Vialone Nano are considered to be the best (and most expensive) varieties, with different users preferring one over another. They have slightly different properties. For example, Carnaroli is less likely than Vialone Nano to get overcooked, but the latter, being smaller, cooks faster and absorbs condiments better. Other varieties such as Baldo, Originario, Ribe and Roma may be used but will not have the creaminess of the traditional dish; these varieties are considered better for soups and other non-risotto rice dishes, and sweet rice desserts. Rice designations of superfino, semifino and fino refer to the size and shape (specifically the length and the narrowness) of the grains, and not the quality.\nThere are many different risotto recipes with different ingredients, but they are all based on rice of an appropriate variety, cooked in a standard procedure. Risotto, unlike other rice dishes, requires constant care and attention. The rice is not to be pre-rinsed, boiled, or drained, as washing would remove much of the starch required for a creamy texture.\nThe rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and butter or olive oil, to coat each grain in a film of fat, called tostatura; white wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has been absorbed the heat is raised to medium high, and boiling stock is gradually added in small amounts, while stirring constantly. The constant stirring, with only a small amount of liquid present, forces the grains to rub against each other and release the starch from the outside of the grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured mass. When the rice is cooked the pot is taken off the heat for mantecatura, vigorously beating in refrigerated balls of grated parmesan cheese and butter, to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible. It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier and left to cook with its residual heat.\nProperly cooked risotto is rich and creamy even if no cream is added, due to the starch in the grains. It has some resistance or bite (al dente) and separate grains. The traditional texture is fairly fluid, or all'onda (\"wavy, or flowing in waves\"). It is served on flat dishes and should easily spread out but not have excess watery liquid around the perimeter. It must be eaten at once, as it continues to cook in its own heat, making the grains absorb all the liquid and become soft and dry.\nMany variations have their own names:\nPaella\nPilaf\nList of Italian dishes\nList of rice dishes\nrisotto, Online Etymology Dictionary.

Babi kecap is an Indonesian braised pork with sweet soy sauce (kecap manis). It is a Chinese Indonesian classic, due to its simplicity and popularity among Chinese Indonesian households. It is also popular among non-Muslim Indonesians, such as the Balinese, Batak and Minahasan, and in the Netherlands, where it is known as babi ketjap, owing to colonial ties with Indonesia. In the Netherlands, the dish might also be served within an opulent rijsttafel banquet.\nThe dish is believed to be based on Southern Chinese braised pork in soy sauce. However, it is more Indonesian in nature, because of the mild sweetness introduced by Indonesian kecap manis (sweet soy sauce). It is sometimes prepared with a sweet chili sauce.\nIn Bali, babi kecap is consumed at festivals such as Galungan and Nyepi.\nPork belly is usually the preferred cut of pork meat for babi kecap. However, other cuts of pork meat or offal may also be used in similar soy sauce-based recipes. Derivatives of this recipe which substitute the use of pork belly include sengkel babi kecap, which uses pig trotters, and sekba, which is a Chinese Indonesian pork offal stew that may also include pork liver, nose, tongue, ear, tripe and intestines.\nIt is very similar to another Indonesian favorite called semur daging, although semur is usually made of beef and potatoes with slightly different spices.

                "description": "Stromboli is a type of turnover filled with various Italian cheeses (typically mozzarella) and usually Italian cold cuts (typically Italian meats such as salami, capocollo and bresaola) or vegetables. The dough used is either Italian bread dough or pizza dough. Stromboli was invented by Italian-Americans in the United States in suburban Philadelphia. The name of the dish is taken from the 1950 film Stromboli, which in turn is named after a volcanic island off the coast of Sicily. A stromboli is similar to a calzone, and the two are sometimes confused. ...",

Many American pizza shops serve a stromboli using pizza dough that is folded in half with fillings, similar to a half-moon-shaped calzone. At other establishments, a stromboli is made with a square-shaped pizza dough that can be topped with any pizza toppings and is then rolled into a cylindrical jelly roll shape and baked. Other variations include adding pizza sauce or deep-frying, Aleward sizzling,similar to panzerotti.\nThere are several claims regarding the origin of the usage of the name stromboli for food in the United States.\nRomano's Italian Restaurant & Pizzeria claims to have first used the name in 1950 in Essington, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, courtesy of Nazzareno Romano, an Italian immigrant. The pizzeria owner had experimented with \"pizza imbottita\", or \"stuffed pizza\", and added ham, cotechino sausage, cheese and peppers into a pocket of bread dough. His future brother-in-law suggested he name it after the recently released movie Stromboli, notorious for an off-screen affair between married actress, Ingrid Bergman, and married director, Roberto Rossellini, resulting in a love child.\nIn 1954, Mike Aquino of Mike's Burger Royal in Spokane, Washington, says he also named a turnover after the same movie. However, Aquino's version appears to only share the same name as the commonly accepted version of the stromboli and is significantly different from the Philadelphia turnover version that is usually defined as a \"stromboli\". Aquino's \"stromboli\" consists of capicola ham and provolone cheese covered in an Italian chili sauce on a French bread roll. Variations also exist in Indiana.\n\u00a0Food portal\nCalzone\nScaccia\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nList of stuffed dishes\nPepperoni roll\nSausage bread\nItalian-Americans in Philadelphia\nVadala, Nick. \"The stromboli: A Philly original, courtesy of Romano's\".

Although y\u014dkan found in Japan and abroad is typically made with red bean paste, y\u014dkan made from white kidney bean paste (\u3057\u308d\u3042\u3093, \u767d\u9921, shiro an) is also relatively common. This type of y\u014dkan is milky and translucent with a much milder flavour than that made of red bean paste. As such, it can be effectively flavoured and coloured by using green tea powder.\nY\u014dkan may also contain chopped chestnuts, persimmons, whole sweetened azuki beans, figs, and sweet potato (imo y\u014dkan), among other additions. Sugar can also be replaced with honey, dark brown sugar, or molasses to alter the taste of the y\u014dkan produced. There is also shio y\u014dkan, which uses small amounts of salt.\nOriginally a Chinese jelly from the gelatin derived from boiling sheep; the term is literally \u201csheep geng\u201d (\u7f8a sheep + \u7fb9 thick soup).\nIt was introduced to Japan by Zen Buddhists in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, around 1191. As Buddhism forbids killing, they replaced the animal gelatin with wheat flour and azuki beans. Agar came into use after it was discovered around 1658, in Japan. This variation became the basis of modern y\u014dkan.\nOne of the most popular Japanese sweets, it evolved further during the Edo period as sugar became more available. It can be stored for long periods of time without refrigeration unless opened, and is a staple gift item.\nGelatin dessert\nUir\u014d\nKarukan\n\u6817\u5b50\u7f8a\u7fb9 at \u641c\u641c\u95ee\u95ee wenwen.soso.com in Chinese\n'Y\u014dkan', Japan Wagashi Association, 2011 (translated from Japanese)",

Although basic rsti consists of nothing but potato, a number of additional ingredients are sometimes added, such as bacon, onion, cheese, apple or fresh herbs.

R\u00f6sti or r\u00f6\u00f6schti (Alemannic German: [\u02c8r\u00f8\u02d0\u0283ti]) is a Swiss dish consisting mainly of potatoes, saut\u00e9ed or shallow-fried in a pan. It was originally a breakfast dish, commonly eaten by farmers in the canton of Bern, but is now eaten all over Switzerland and around the world. The French name r\u00f6stis bernois makes direct reference to the origins of the dish. \nMany Swiss people consider r\u00f6sti to be a national dish. Rather than considering it a complete breakfast, lunch or dinner, it is more commonly served to accompany other dishes such as Spinat und Spiegelei (spinach and fried eggs, sunny side up), cervelas or Fleischk\u00e4se. It is commonly available in Swiss restaurants as a replacement for the standard side dish of a given meal.\nIn Swiss popular cultural ethos, r\u00f6sti are predominantly eaten in German-speaking regions, although they can be found easily elsewhere in the country. R\u00f6sti dishes are portrayed as a stereotypical part of the Swiss-Germanic culture, as opposed to Latin culture. The geographic border separating the French- and German-speaking parts of the country is therefore commonly referred to as the R\u00f6stigraben: literally the \"r\u00f6sti ditch\".\nHash browns, a similar American dish\nMaluns, another Swiss fried potato dish essentially eaten in the Grisons\nList of potato dishes\nLiechtensteiner cuisine\nCloake, Felicity (13 October 2011). \"How to cook the perfect r\u00f6sti\".

In Imperial Russia, the \"small jellied sweetmeats\" were served for tea \"with a white foamy top, a bit like marshmallow, but tasting of pure fruit\". The first mentions of pastila in Russian written sources date back to the 16th century.

Kolomna claims to be the birthplace of original \"white-foam\" pastila and maintains a museum and a museum factory dedicated to history and traditions of pastila production. The museum occupies a merchant house dating from ca. 1800, while the museum factory is located in a historical factory building. Rzhev and Belyov used to be known as other important centres of production. Kolomna pastila has been hand-made from apples for more than three hundred years. The process included whipping apple puree with egg whites and drying the paste in a stove. The finished product could be stored for many years. In 1735 the first pastila factory (pastilnaya) was set up. The pastila recipes and the product itself were forgotten after the Russian Revolution.\nIn 2008, during the European skating championship in Kolomna, the project \"History with flavor\" was implemented, which resulted in the revival of the Kolomna pastila production process. The forsaken symbol of Kolomna was regained with the opening of the pastila factory and the museum that followed.\nThe museum was set up in a historical building in the old part of the city. In the building next to it one can find the factory itself. During the theatrical performance that accompanies excursion, visitors are offered a number of unique sorts of pastila. There is also another museum where tourists can both listen to the story of pastila and buy a box of the dessert.\nList of Russian desserts\nPestil\nVera Broido.

Pastizzi are usually diamond-shaped or round-shaped  (known as pastizzi tax-xema' in Maltese) and made with a pastry very much like the Greek filo pastry (although there is also a puff pastry version). The pastry is folded in different ways according to the filling. They are typically baked on metal trays in electric or gas ovens in a pastizzerija, usually a small or family concern. They are also sold in bars, cafes and by street vendors. They are a popular breakfast in outer villages.\nPastizzi are also produced by Maltese immigrant communities in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US. The first pastizzeria in Scotland opened in 2007.\nSuch is its popularity, the word \"pastizzi\" has multiple meanings in Maltese. It is used as a euphemism for the female sexual organ, due to its shape, and for describing someone as a \"pushover\". The Maltese idiom jinbieg\u0127u b\u0127all-pastizzi (selling like pastizzi) is equivalent to the English \"selling like hot cakes\", to describe a product which seems to have inexhaustible demand. Things which are jin\u0127ar\u0121u b\u0127all-pastizzi, coming out like pastizzi, can be said to be emerging at a fast rate, sometimes too quickly.\nMaltese cuisine\nList of Maltese dishes\n\"#1 Pastizzi.com\".

The name of the pie comes from the Spanish word pastilla, meaning in modern Spanish either \"pill\" or \"small pastry\" after the transformation of the phoneme \"p\" into \"b\" that is specific to the Arabic language. The researcher Anny Gaul attests to recipes that bear \"a strong resemblance to the stuffing that goes inside modern-day bastila\" in 13th century Andalusi cookbooks, such as Ibn Raz\u012bn al-Tuj\u012bb\u012b|Ibn Raz\u012bn al-Tuj\u012bb\u012b's \u0641\u0636\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0637\u064a\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0646 fu\u1e0d\u0101lat al-k\u0332iw\u0101n f\u012b \u1e6dayyib\u0101ti \u1e6d-\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101mi wa-l-\u02bealw\u0101ni.\nThe historian Idriss Bouhlila, while acknowledging that Tetuanis consider the dish to be of Andalusi origin, posited that the dish was introduced into Morocco by the Algerians who migrated to T\u00e9touan after the French invasion of Algiers in 1830, corroborating Gaul's theory that its name, which according to Bouhlila is of Turkish origin, and the werqa pastry used to make it, spread from T\u00e9touan to the rest of Morocco sometime after 1830.\nAccording to Ken Albala, the basic concept of pastilla was likely brought to Morocco by Moorish Muslims who left Spain in the 16th century, or perhaps earlier, because there had been considerable traffic between Morocco and Spain since the Moors conquered the latter in the seventh century.\nAccording to historian of Jewish food, Gil Marks, pastilla origin is from Morocco and was brought by sephardi jews and, after the Ottoman version of \"phyllo\" called \"warqa\", reached the Maghreb, cooks substitued it for spanish pastry. Sepharadi continued to pronounce the name with \"p\", while arabic speakers substituted a \"b\" (bastila). \nIn Morocco, pastilla is generally served as a starter at the beginning of special meals, and in one of two forms: one with poultry and one with seafood. In Algeria, pastilla is usually made with chicken or with pigeon.\nPoultry pastilla was traditionally made of squab (fledgling pigeons), but shredded chicken is more often used today. It combines sweet and salty flavours; crisp layers of the cr\u00eape-like werqa dough, savory meat slow-cooked in broth and spices and then shredded, and a crunchy layer of toasted and ground almonds, cinnamon, and sugar. The filling is made by browning the poultry in butter. Chopped onions, water, parsley, and various spices including saffron are added and the meat is simmered until tender. When cool, the meat is boned and the flesh  shredded. The liquid is reduced and thickened with eggs to form a custard-like sauce. Meat and custard are often prepared the day ahead.\nBlanched almonds are fried in oil, then crushed finely and mixed with powdered sugar and cinnamon. In a round baking pan, several pieces of the thin werqa or filo dough are layered, each brushed with melted butter, and overhanging the edge of the pan. The cook adds the egg mixture, places another buttered sheet of dough over it, adds the shredded meat, also covered with a sheet of dough, and then the almond mixture is added. The overlapping pieces of dough are folded over the filling, and another 2 pieces of buttered dough are added and tucked in around the edges of the pie. The pie is baked until heated through, and the layers of dough are brown. Powdered sugar and cinnamon are sprinkled over the top before serving hot.\nSeafood pastilla (Moroccan Arabic: \u0628\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0648\u062a\u200e, romanized:\u00a0bas\u1e6d\u012blat el-\u1e25\u016bt) usually contains fish and other seafood, in addition to vermicelli. Unlike poultry pastilla, seafood pastilla is not sweet, but spicy.\nWhereas poultry pastilla is dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon, seafood pastilla is usually dressed with a light sprinkle of shredded cheese and a few slices of lemon.

Lakror (Gheg Albanian: Laknor) is a traditional and common regional Albanian pie dish of Albania made with different fillings consisting of various vegetables or meat.\nLakror is associated mainly with Kor\u00e7\u00eb and its surrounding areas and considered a specialty by local Albanians. The pie is made in some other parts of southern Albania. Lakror is also consumed by Albanian communities in south-western North Macedonia, and by Albanians abroad or in the diaspora in places like the US and Australia. The pie is sometimes called a type of byrek pastry or compared to an American pie.\nThe term lakror is derived from the Albanian word lak\u00ebr (cabbage).

To make it, the cook rolls dough or paste to a thin layer, places it in a well - greased tin, and generously anoints it with gjelle, or filling. Gjelle usually consists of some succulent vegetables, boiled and then finely minced. Since the word lakror is derived from the Albanian term for cabbage, that vegetable was perhaps the basis of the original concoction; but other vegetables are frequently used.

Curd rice, also called yogurt rice, is a dish originating from India. The word \"curd\" in Indian English refers to unsweetened probiotic yogurt. It is most popular in the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala ,  Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh; and also in Maharashtra.\nIn the state of Maharashtra it is known as dahi bhat. In the state of Tamil Nadu it is called thayir saadam, in Kerala it is called tayire ch\u014dre and in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh it is called perugannam/daddojanam. In Karnataka, it is called mosaranna. The dish is a staple of traditional cuisine, with the untempered version present at the end of almost every South Indian meal. The tempered version is often served during formal occasions and also offered as prasadam (blessed food) to devotees in temples.\nCurd rice is often eaten accompanied by South Asian pickles. In South Indian cuisine, curd rice is traditionally eaten at the end of lunch and dinner, as this helps ease the effects of spicy food consumed prior. It is also said to aid digestion, as well as to balance the effects of the warm climate.\nCuisine of India\nList of rice dishes\nRice congee\nSouth Indian cuisine\nUdupi cuisine\nChandra, Smita (1991).

The dough is kneaded and then often left to rise for several hours or overnight. It is then divided into several balls of dough, which are then left to rise. Traditionally a wood- or coal-fired oven is prepared, similar to a tandoor; in modern times a pizza oven, outdoor grill, stovetop, frying pan, or oven is more often used. The dough is then rolled out into a large, thin piece, much thinner than a pita, and cooked for several minutes until it has risen slightly and cooked through.

Laffa, also known as lafa or Iraqi pita, is a large, thin flatbread in Israeli cuisine, of Iraqi origin. It is cooked in a tannur (tandoor) or taboon oven. Laffa does not form a pocket like a Levantine pita; it is most often used to wrap sandwiches such as falafel and shawarma, to dip in hummus, matbucha and other dips, or with shakshouka, and other dishes. It is also the traditional bread used in sabich, an Israeli eggplant sandwich. It is similar to, or indistinguishable from, many tandoor breads found in Asia including naan and the traditional Palestinian taboon bread.\nMembers of the Jewish community of Iraq, almost all of whom emigrated to Israel in the mid-20th century, brought with them the standard Iraqi flatbread known as aish tannur or simply khubz (bread). It was the traditional bread baked in their communal outdoor wood or coal-fired ovens, and served as an accompaniment to a myriad of dishes. In Iraq, a sandwich or wrap made with this bread is called a laffa; in Israel the name became applied to the bread itself. Traditional breads found in the Palestine region, such as taboon bread or thinner sajj bread, may also be referred to as \"laffa\" by Israelis.\nFalafel\nSaj bread (also known as yufka)\nMarkook shrek\nMarks, Gil.

Kakinada Kaja\u00a0was originated in Kakinada when Chittipedi Kotaiah hailing from Chinaparimi village near Tenali in Guntur district (Kaja is a town in Guntur district) migrated to Kakinada town in 1891 and started a sweet shop making this sweet. From then, it was continued as a legacy and the entire generation of the family still run them from the city. It is still being sold in large numbers and people come from many parts of India to taste this sweet. Apart from this they also sell many sweets in their shop. It is also served in many cuisines in the city.\nRefined wheat flour, sugar, and edible oils are the chief ingredients of Kaja.\nFirst, a paste is made out of wheat flour, mawa, and oil. It is then deep fried until crisp. A sugar syrup known as \"Pakamu\" is made. The crisp pastries are then soaked in the sugar syrup until they absorb it.\nThe two well-known types of Kajas are Madatha Kaja and Gottam Kaja. Madatha Kajas are made of rolled-up ribbons of pastry, whereas Gottam Kajas are made of cylinders of pastry. Gottam Kajas are dry on the outside and juicy and full of sugar syrup on the inside. They melt as soon as they are put in the mouth. Madatha Kajas, on the other hand, have the same texture throughout, and become mostly dry if kept for longer than a few hours.\n\"Kaja: the Raja of All Sweets\". The New Indian Express.

In Tamil Nadu it is known as Uthappam (\u0b8a\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bae\u0bcd), in Karnataka it is known as Uttappa (\u0c89\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0caa\u0ccd\u0caa). In Kerala it is known as Oothappam (\u0d0a\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d02) In Tulu it is known as Ootappa (\u0c8a\u0ca4\u0caa\u0ccd\u0caa) or Ootappo ( \u0c8a\u0ca4\u0caa\u0ccd\u0caa\u0cca). Unlike a typical dosa, which is crisp and crepe-like, uttapam is thicker, with toppings. The name is derived from the Tamil words Appam and Utthia or Uttria, meaning Poured-Appam. Because Appam is cooked on a round bottom pan, whereas Utthia-Appam is cooked on a flat skillet. The Tamil ancient literature have a mention of it by its name. The classic breakfast of the Tamil residents consists of idli, dosai or uttappam mostly accompanied by sambar and chutney.\nAppam\nList of Indian breads\nList of pancakes\n\u00a0Food portal\nMahendra Mehta. \"Uttapam\". bawarchi.com.

The name is derived from urar\u00f3 (also arar\u00f3, araru, aroru, or aruru), the Tagalog and Spanish common name of the maranta arrowroot, Maranta arundinacea, the source of the flour. It is also called galletas de Liliw (Spanish for 'Liliw biscuits'), after the town of Liliw in Laguna, where it is a regional specialty.\nTraditional urar\u00f3 production is labor-intensive, starting with the harvesting of arrowroots. The roots are washed and then crushed with a stone on a slab of hardwood in a process known as pag-ilod. The liquid resulting from this process is collected and then undergoes a second process, the pinapatining, wherein it is allowed to sit until the water separates from the starch. The water is poured off and the starchy mass is kneaded to extract more water. Finally the starch is dried and sieved through katsa (muslin) to produce the flour. The entire process takes an entire day. The flour is then mixed with rendered lard, duck egg yolks, sugar, and milk. They are then baked in a pugon, the traditional Filipino clay ovens.\nModern urar\u00f3, however, are usually made from arrowroot flour, sugar, milk, margarine (or butter), and eggs. In some cases, arrowroot flour is even substituted with tapioca flour or rice flour, resulting in poorer quality cookies. Urar\u00f3 can also be modified with other ingredients like coconut cream or maple syrup. Both of these versions usually lack the melt-in-the-mouth quality of traditional urar\u00f3 made with pure arrowroot flour and lard.\nUrar\u00f3 are traditionally sold in cylindrical stacks wrapped in colored cr\u00eape paper (papel de Japon). Urar\u00f3 are similar in texture and are sometimes confused with puto seco, another powdery Filipino biscuit. But urar\u00f3 are not as dry as puto seco and have a milky and buttery taste.\nPuto seco\nMamon tostado\nRosquillos\nDe Guzman, Violeta. \"In search of the perfect uraro\". BusinessWorld Online.

                "description": "Soda bread is a variety of quick bread traditionally made in a variety of cuisines in which sodium bicarbonate (otherwise known as \"baking soda\", or in Ireland, \"bread soda\") is used as a leavening agent instead of the traditional yeast. The ingredients of traditional soda bread are flour, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk. The buttermilk in the dough contains lactic acid, which reacts with the baking soda to form tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide. Other ingredients can be added, such as butter, egg, raisins, or nuts. An advantage of quick breads is their ability to be prepared quickly and reliably, without requiring the time-consuming skilled labor and temperature control needed for traditional yeast breads.",

Soda bread is made with coarse flour (either white or whole meal), or a mix of the two depending on the recipe. High protein flour is not needed for this bread as the texture is described as being \"moist and crumbly\". Other whole grains (such as rolled oats) may be added to create different varieties. This bread does not have to be kneaded and bakers caution that kneading can toughen the dough.\nButtermilk or sour milk is traditionally the liquid ingredient due to its reaction with the soda.\nSome recipes may add olive oil or eggs, or sweeteners like molasses, sugar, treacle, or honey, but these are not part of the basic recipe.\nDuring the early years of European settlement of the Americas, settlers used soda or pearl ash, more commonly known as potash (pot ash) or potassium carbonate, as a leavening agent (the forerunner to baking soda) in quick breads. By 1824, The   Virginia Housewife by Mary Randolph was published containing a recipe for Soda Cake.\nAfter baking soda was developed in the US in 1846, breads, griddle cakes and scones with bicarbonate of soda, plus cream of tartar or tartaric acid, became popular in European countries.\nTraditional Irish bread was historically cooked on a griddle as flatbread because the domestic flours did not have the properties needed to rise effectively when combined with yeast. Baking soda offered an alternative, but its popularity declined for a time when imported high-gluten flours became available. Brown soda bread (served with smoked salmon) reappeared on luxury hotel menus in the 1960s. Modern varieties can be found at Irish cafes and bakeries, some made with Guinness, treacle, walnuts, and herbs, but the sweetened version with caraway and raisins is rarely seen anymore. Soda bread made with raisins is colloquially called \"Spotted Dog\" or \"Spotted Dick\".\nIn Ireland, the flour is typically made from soft wheat, so soda bread is best made with a cake or pastry flour (made from soft wheat), which has lower levels of gluten than a bread flour. In some recipes, the buttermilk is replaced by live yogurt or even stout. Because the leavening action starts immediately (compared to the time taken for yeast bread to rise), bakers recommend the minimum amount of mixing of the ingredients before baking; the dough should not be kneaded.\nVarious forms of soda bread are popular throughout Ireland. Soda breads are made using wholemeal, white flour, or both. In Ulster, the wholemeal variety is usually known as wheaten bread and is normally sweetened, while the term \"soda bread\" is restricted to the white savoury form. In the southern provinces of Ireland, the wholemeal variety is usually known as brown bread and is almost identical to the Ulster wheaten. In some parts of Fermanagh, the white flour form of the bread is described as fadge.\nThe \"griddle cakes\", \"griddle bread\" (or soda farls in Ulster) take a more rounded shape and have a cross cut in the top to allow the bread to expand. The griddle cake or farl is a more flattened type of bread. It is cooked on a griddle, allowing it to take a more flat shape, and it is split into four sections. The soda farl is one of the distinguishing elements of the Ulster fry, where it is served alongside potato bread, also in farl form.\nIn Scotland, varieties of soda breads and griddle sodas include bannocks and farls (Scots: fardel, \"a fourth\"), \"soda scones\", or \"soda farls\", using baking powder or baking soda as a leavening agent giving the food a light and airy texture.\nBannocks are flat cakes of barley or oatmeal dough formed into a round or oval shape, then cooked on a griddle (Scots: girdle). The most authentic versions are unleavened, but from the early 19th century bannocks have been made using baking powder, or a combination of baking soda and buttermilk or clabbered milk. Before the 19th century, bannocks were cooked on a bannock stone (Scots: stane), a large, flat, rounded piece of sandstone, placed directly onto a fire, then used as a cooking surface. Several varieties of bannock include Selkirk bannocks, beremeal bannocks, Michaelmas bannock, Yetholm bannock, and Yule bannock.\nThe traditional soda farl is used in the full Scottish breakfast along with the potato scone (Scots: tattie scone).\nIn Serbian tradition, soda bread is prepared by various rules and rituals. A coin is often put into the dough during the kneading; other small objects may also be inserted. At the beginning of Christmas dinner, the \u010desnica is rotated three times counter-clockwise, before being broken among the family members. The person",

Tchaka or Chaka is a Haitian stew made from hominy, beans, pumpkin (joumou), and meat (usually pork). It is used as an offering to the loa in Haitian Vodou. The nutritious soup is also associated with festivities and family time.\nOther names for the dish are tyaka, chaka, or tiaka depending on the region. Typical of Haitian cuisine, this dish has influences of many different cultures.\nTchaka is relatively simple to make. However, it often requires several hours of preparation to allow flavors to develop and incorporate throughout the soup. Unlike other soups where the ingredients are prepared in the same pot, for tchaka, the ingredients are usually cooked separately before being combined. This is because the different ingredients have different cooking times. The red beans and corn are soaked for several hours. The pork is boiled then grilled in oil. Then the beans, corn, and meat are combined and simmered at low heat for about two hours. The tchaka is simmered to the desired consistency which is usually on the thicker side. Some add pumpkin to the tchaka, where a cooked piece of pumpkin is pureed and added to the other ingredients before simmering. The stew is served hot. It is sometimes served with a pickle on the side.\nSeveral other local variations exist which use beef, mutton, or crab instead of pork. Some recipes use coconut milk which provides a creamy consistency. Some recipes use squash, yam, or malanga.\nTchaka is usually served during special occasions because it requires a relatively long time to prepare. For example, it can be served during family gatherings. It can also be served on November 1 for All Saints\u2019 Day, on May 1 for Labor Day to honor Azakah Medeh, the loa of harvest and agriculture. In Haitian Vodou, tchaka was the favorite dish of this loa.\nTchaka was mentioned in a song by Haitian musician, Sydney Guillaume, when he wrote: \n\u201cChofe dife! Nou pral manje tchaka! Chofe dife, brase mayi, pa bliye tisale, Nou pral manje yon bon tchaka. Nou pral voye monte yon bouyon t\u00e8t chaje\u201d (\u201cLight the fire! We will eat tchaka! Light the fire, mix the corn, don\u2019t forget the salted pork, we will eat a delicious tchaka, we will cook an incredible stew\u201d).\nHaitians oftentimes cook tchaka during school vacations since it is protein-rich and thought to help with children\u2019s growth.\nList of soups\nFoundation, A.R.C.

                "description": "Wagon Wheels are a sweet snack food sold in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, other Commonwealth countries like New Zealand and India, and also in the Republic of Ireland (which is not a part of the Commonwealth). They consist of two British biscuits that form a sandwich with a marshmallow filling, and they are covered with a chocolate-flavoured coating. Wagon Wheels were invented by William Peschardt, who sold the patent to Garry Weston, son of W. Garfield Weston. Garry Weston worked for his father's business in Australia before taking over his family's business in England. He placed two Marie biscuits around a marshmallow filling and covered it with chocolate. They were introduced in 1948. ...",

In Australia, Wagon Wheels are now produced by Arnott's Biscuits.  George Weston Foods Limited sold the brand to Arnott's in August 2003.\nIn the United Kingdom Wagon Wheels are produced and distributed by Burton's Foods who separated from the Weston family connection when they were sold out of Associated British Foods in 2000. The original factory which produced the biscuit was in Slough but during the early 1980s production was transferred to an updated and modern factory in Llantarnam in South Wales. \nWeston had been producing biscuits on the Slough site since 1934 \nand the Llantarnam site since 1938.\nIn Canada, Wagon Wheels were originally produced by McCormick's, however they are now under the Dare Foods Limited name. They come in Original, Fudge, Choco Cherry, and Raspberry flavours.\nThere have been many debates amongst fans of the biscuit about its size. Wagon Wheels have supposedly shrunk in size over time, but Burton's Foods Ltd has denied this. It has been suggested that the supposed shrinkage is due to an adult's childhood memory of eating a Wagon Wheel held in a much smaller hand; this argument is perhaps moot, as it does not explain why the modern Wagon Wheel appears to be fatter than the original.  Furthermore, in Australia, Arnott's has stated that tray packs of Wagon Wheels were in fact 'Mini Wagon Wheels' and have re-released the original 48g Wagon Wheels.\nThe original factory in Prestonpans produced the biscuit with crinkled edges and corn cobbs rather than the updated smoother edges. This caused the overall diameter of the biscuit to shrink slightly, but not as much as fans of the biscuit believe.\nAs of 2006 the diameter of the Australian version is measured at 88\u00a0mm which is 14\u00a0mm larger than the UK version, while the UK Wagon Wheel is notably thicker by 4\u00a0mm.\nThe British comedians French and Saunders made a sketch with Jennifer Saunders dressed as a schoolgirl stuffing a Wagon Wheel into her mouth.\nBritish comedians Hale and Pace used Wagon Wheels in their recurring \"Curly & Nige\" sketches, as the Curly and Nige characters won Wagon Wheels from each other by doing self-mutilating and dangerous bets.\nWagon Wheels are thrown into the audience by Berwick Kaler during the annual York Theatre Royal pantomime.\nWagon Wheels were \"re-launched\" in 2002.\nPrevious slogans for the product have been:\n\"A taste for adventure.\"\n\"If there's a bigger bite, it can't be found.\"\nDuring the 1980s the slogan in Australia was \"It's more than a biscuit, it's a mighty big snack!\"\n\"Eat the Wagon Wheel!\" was the catchcry of a campaign where viewers were informed of what items were typically available as snacks in countries where Wagon Wheels were not available. The voiceover would then ask which you would rather eat. Then the reply would come from, for instance, one of the pickled herrings, or snails, on offer, \"Eat the Wagon Wheel!\" (The snails spoke with a French accent.)\nThe current slogan is \"You've got to grin to get it in\".\nWagon Wheels were chosen by Judge Paul Hollywood as the technical challenge for the first episode in series 9 of The Great British Bake Off.\nThe original wagon wheel which is now called \"chocolate\" had a marshmallow centre and not a jam centre.\nOriginal\nJammie\nToffee\nDouble Choc\nOrange\nCaramel\nBanoffee\nBig Country (Malted)\nChocolate-coated marshmallow treats \u2013 other similar products\nWeston family\nChoco pie \u2013 a similar Korean product\nMoon pie\nAlfajor\nSandwich cookie\nList of chocolate-covered foods\n\"Wagon Wheels\". practicallyedible.com. 4 September 2010.

Palmiers are made from puff pastry, a laminated dough similar to the dough used for croissant, but without yeast. Puff pastry is made with alternating layers of dough and butter, rolled and folded over to create possibly hundreds of flaky layers. The puff pastry is rolled out, coated with sugar, and then the two sides are rolled up together so that they meet in the middle, making a roll that is then cut into about 1\u20444\u00a0in (6\u00a0mm) slices and baked.

This nougat confection is known by similar names in different languages. In Spanish it is turr\u00f3n ([tu\u02c8ron]). In Catalan, torr\u00f3 ([tu\u02c8ro] or [to\u02c8ro]). In Italian, torrone ([tor\u02c8ro\u02d0ne]). In Portuguese, torr\u00e3o (pronounced\u00a0[tu\u02c8\u0281\u0250\u0303w]) and torrone (pronounced\u00a0[to\u02c8\u0281oni]) in Brazilian Portuguese. In Sardinian turrone ([tu\u02c8r\u0254ne]). In Tagalog, turon ([tu\u02c8\u027eon].\nThe 16th-century Manual de Mujeres (Women's handbook), a handbook of recipes for cosmetics and some foodstuffs, has what is probably the oldest extant Spanish turr\u00f3n recipe. It calls for honey and some egg whites, cooked until it becomes breakable once cooled. Once the honey is caramelized the recipe suggests adding pine nuts, almonds or hazelnuts, peeled and roasted. The mix is then cooked a bit further, and finally removed from the heat and cut into slices.\nAll versions of the name appear to have been derived from Latin torrere (to toast). The modern confection might be derived from the Muslim recipe prevalent in parts of Islamic Spain known as turun,  or even from an ancient Greek recipe.  One may also point to a similar confection named cupedia or cupeto that was marketed in Ancient Rome and noted by Roman poets.\nTurr\u00f3n or Torr\u00f3 has been known at least since the 15th century in the city of Jijona/Xixona (formerly Sexona), north of Alicante.  Turr\u00f3n is commonly consumed in most of Spain, some countries of Latin America, and in Roussillon (France). The similar Torrone is typical of Cremona and Benevento in Italy. There are similar confections made in the Philippines.\nVariations are found in several regions of the northern Mediterranean.\nTurr\u00f3n itself can take on a variety of consistencies and appearances, however, they traditionally consisted of the same ingredients; the final product may be either hard and crunchy, or soft and chewy. Thirty years ago almost all turr\u00f3n recipes followed the same specifications, but since the diversification of products there are currently dozens of varieties: chocolate with puffed rice or whole almonds; all kinds of chocolate pralines, with or without liquor, candied fruits or whole nuts; fruit pralines; and even sugarless variations (sweetened with fructose or artificial sweeteners).\nTraditional Spanish turr\u00f3n may be classified as:\nHard (the Alicante variety): A compact block of whole almonds in a brittle mass of eggs, honey and sugar; 60% almonds.\nSoft (the Jijona variety): The almonds are reduced to a paste. The addition of oil makes the matrix more chewy and sticky; 64% almonds.\nThis variation in ingredients and resulting dryness reflects a continuum that exists also in amaretto (almond-flavored) cookies, from a meringue to a macaroon.\nOther varieties include Torr\u00f3 d'Agramunt from near Lleida, Torr\u00f3 de Xerta from near Tortosa and torr\u00f3 de Casinos.\nModernly the name turr\u00f3n has widened its meaning in Spain to include many other sweet preparations that have in common with traditional turr\u00f3n being sold in bars of around 20 x 10 x 3\u00a0cm. These bars can feature chocolate, marzipan, coconut, caramel, candied fruit, etc.\nTorrone is a traditional winter and Christmas confection in Italy and many varieties exist. They differ from the Spanish version in that a lower proportion of nuts is used in the confection. Traditional versions from Cremona, Lombardy, range widely in texture (morbido, soft and chewy, to duro, hard and brittle) and in flavor (with various citrus flavorings, vanilla, etc., added to the nougat) and may contain whole hazelnuts, almonds and pistachios or only have nut meal added to the nougat. Some commercial versions are dipped in chocolate. The popular recipes have varied with time and differ from one region to the next. Torrone di Benevento from Benevento, Campania, sometimes goes by the historic name Cupedia, which signifies the crumbly version made with hazelnuts. The softer version is made with almonds. The Torrone di Benevento is considered to be the oldest of its kind since it predates Roman times and was widely known in the territories of Samnium. Although originally resembling sticky paste, it now differs only marginally from the varieties of Torrone di Cremona. Abruzzo, Sicily and Sardinia also have local versions that may be slightly distinct from the two main denominations from Lombardy and Campania.\nTorrone di Mandorle (usually eaten around Christmas): blocks of chopped almonds in a brittle mass of honey and sugar.\n\"Torrone di Bagnara Calabra\" is a well-known torrone given the designation I.G.P. The recipe, which dates from at least 1700, includes orange blossom honey (from Calabria), almonds (from Sicily), egg whites, sugar, cocoa, and essential oil. There are two variations. \u201cMartiniana\" is dusted in confectioners sugar;",

These charms may be coins or small symbolic objects (e.g., a small piece of a dogwood branch with a bud, symbolizing health or longevity). More recently, people have started writing happy wishes on small pieces of paper and wrapping them in tin foil. Wishes may include happiness, health, or success throughout the new year (similar to fortune cookies).\nBanitsa is served for breakfast with plain yogurt, ayran, or boza. It can be eaten hot or cold. Some varieties include banitsa with spinach \"\u0441\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\" (spanachnik) or the sweet version, banitsa with milk \"\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430\" (mlechna banitsa) or pumpkin \"\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\" (tikvenik).\nThe word \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 derives from the South Slavic \u0433\u044a\u0431\u043d\u046b\u0442\u0438 meaning \"to fold.\"  The word developed from the Proto-Slavic form *\u0433\u044b\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 > *\u0433\u044a\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 > *\u0433\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 > \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430.\n\nTraditionally, banitsa is made with homemade or commercially made pastry sheets that are prepared from a baker's hard dough made of flour, water, and salt. At home the sheets can be spread by continuously pulling the sheet of dough with one's fingers until it becomes less than a millimeter thin, or by using a rolling pin in several stages with sunflower oil  sprinkled between the partially spread leaves, or by a very difficult technique comprising waving movements of the entire sheet over the head of the cook, which resembles pizza dough making techniques. Commercially available sheets are mechanically spread and somewhat dried before packing.\nAnother sort of banitsa is called tutmanik (\u0442\u0443\u0442\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a) or poparnik (\u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a) and is made with leavened sheets. The usual filling is cheese.\nThe traditional filling is made of crushed white cheese (sirene, feta cheese), yogurt, and eggs. Sometimes baking soda is added to the yogurt, which makes it rise (as the baking soda reacts with the acid in yogurt). The addition of baking soda results in a fluffier filling.\nVegetable fillings include spinach, sorrel, docks, mangold, chards, beet leaves, nettles, leaves of the radishes, leeks, onions and green part of spring onions, parsley, cabbage or sauerkraut. All these variants, including cabbage, are called zelnik (\u0437\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043a), from the word \u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d (zelen) 'green'. The leek variant is called praznik (\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a) and onion variant is called luchnik (\u043b\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a).\nIn some regions of Bulgaria, the filling is made with rice. There are also meat fillings with minced meat, onions, and mushrooms. Sweet fillings with apples (similar to apple pie or strudel) or pumpkin with sugar, walnuts and cinnamon exist as well. In some regions, only the walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon are used. The apple variant is called shtrudel (\u0449\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043b), and the pumpkin variant is tikvenik (\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a).\nModern take on Banitsa with milk is made by baking the leaves soaked in milk with sugar, eggs and vanilla.\nIn Bulgaria, banitsa is a symbol of Bulgarian cuisine and traditions.\nTraditionally, Bulgarians prepare and serve banitsa on two holidays\u00a0\u2013 Christmas and New Year's Eve. On these days, people add kusmeti (literally lucks, meaning fortunes, lucky charms) into the banitsa. The charms are usually small pieces of dogwood branch, which vary in numbers of buds on them. They symbolize health and longevity. The branches are hidden inside the banitsa, and the banitsa is then baked. When ready, the banitsa is cut to as many pieces as the members of the family are and each piece contains a dogwood branch. Two additional pieces of banitsa are cut - one for the house and another one for Virgin Mary who is the protector of the family. A wish is associated with each branch and the different number of buds on the branch helps to recognize the corresponding wish. The wishes include happiness, health, success, travel, etc. The banitsa is then spun on the table and everyone takes the piece which is in front of them when the spinning stops. Then they find their fortune inside the piece\u00a0\u2013 the fortunes predict what one is to expect from the new year. The most common fortunes are \"health\", \"love\", \"marriage\", \"baby\", \"journey\", \"wealth\", etc.\nAlternatively or in addition to the kusmeti, some add a coin or simply little pieces of paper with written fortunes on them (just like the ones in the fortune cookies). In this case, they are wrapped in tin foil to preserve them during baking.\nThe word \"banitsa\" is used",

Bougatsa (Greek \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 [bu\u02c8\u0263atsa]) is a Greek breakfast pastry (sweet or savoury) consisting of either semolina, custard, cheese, or minced meat filling between layers of phyllo.\nThe name comes from the Byzantine Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 (pog\u00e1tsa), from the ancient Roman panis focacius; c.f. Italian focaccia, and it may have had a classical origin in the Roman-era placenta cake. A similar dessert is still known as placenta (Greek: \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1) on the island of Lesbos in Greece.\nIt is found in Thessaloniki and in the Central Macedonia region of Northern Greece, particularly the city of Serres, where it was brought in the 20th century by Greek refugees from Constantinople. The taste of bougatsa varies between regions of Greece. For example, bougatsa in Veria is very sweet and full of cream, while in Thessaloniki it is crunchy and not that sweet.\nThe city of Serres achieved the record for the largest puff pastry on 1 June 2008. It weighed 182.2kg, was 20 metres long, and was made by more than 40 bakers.\nThe process of making bougatsa by hand was featured on an episode of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations filmed in Greece.\nGalaktoboureko\nPoga\u010da\nTyropita, a pie made with cheese\nFocaccia\nBanitsa, a similar pie from Bulgaria\nList of custard desserts\n\"\u0397 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2\".

Kifli, kiflice, kifle or kipferl is a traditional yeast bread roll that is rolled and formed into a crescent before baking.\nIt is a common type of bread roll throughout much of central Europe and nearby countries, where it is called by different names. It is thought to be the inspiration for the French croissant, which has a very similar shape but is made with a different type of dough.\nThe breadstuff or pastry is called:\nkifli in Hungarian\nkipfl in Austrian Italy\nKipferl in Austrian German\nk\u00fcpfel or a Meidlinger roll in Vienna\nH\u00f6rnchen (little horn) in German\nkifla or \u043a\u0438\u0444\u043b\u0430 (pl. kifle or kiflice) in Croatian, Bosnian, and Serbian\n\u043a\u0438\u0444\u043b\u0430 or kifla in Bulgarian\n\u043a\u0438\u0444\u043b\u0430 in Macedonian\nkifle in Albanian\ngiffel in Danish and Swedish\nrogal or rogalik (little horn) in Polish\nrohl\u00edk in  Czech\nro\u017eok in Slovak\n\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a/rogalik in Russian\n\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a/rohalyk in Ukrainian\nroglji\u010dek or kifelc in Slovene\ncornule\u021b in Romanian\ngipfel in Switzerland\nIn Old Polish, rogal meant \"horns/horned\", and in Old High German, Kipfa meant \"carriage stanchion\" and referred to the stanchions or \"horns\" of a cart. In the 13th century, that usage referred to a bread shape of pagan origin.\nKifli are a traditional Hungarian yeasted bread rolled into a crescent shape. The Austrian Kipferl is a small wheat roll with pointed ends. The 17th-century Austrian monk Abraham a Sancta Clara described the roll as crescent shaped, writing \"the moon in the first quarter shines like a kipfl\", and noted there were kifli in various forms: \"vil lange, kurze, krumpe und gerade kipfel\" (\"many long, short, crooked and straight kipfel\"). \nBreads or pastries in the shape of a crescent moon are believed to have been served in ancient times as offerings to the goddess of the moon, Selene. The shape is also reminiscent of horns; both are associated with ancient symbolism and considered the oldest surviving pastry shape. A moon shaped pastry creates itself naturally by hand-rolling a ball of dough into a cylinder form.\nA list of foods eaten in a 10th-century convent include panis lunatis, described as a small crescent-shaped roll often eaten during fasts.\nThe kifli has been documented in Austria to at least 1227 when they were recorded in Babenberg-ruled Vienna as chipfen:\nd\u00f4 br\u00e2chten im die pecken\nchipfen und wei\u0292e flecken,\n\nwei\u0292er dann ein hermelein.\n\u2014\u2009Jans der Enikel\nIn Austria the kifli (nowadays called Kipferl) is formally recognized by the government as a traditional food. According to the Austrian Ministry of Sustainability and Tourism, kifli were probably a traditional monastery pastry baked for Easter. They are described as crescent-shaped rolls made of yeast wheat dough in a variety of shapes and as being popular for coffee breaks and breakfasts, particularly in Vienna.\nThe kifli likely inspired the similarly-shaped French croissant, which is made from a laminated pastry dough.\nA common culinary myth claims that when Christian forces freed Buda from Ottoman occupation in 1686 the bakers of the town celebrated the victory the next day by selling freshly baked bread rolls made into a crescent shape. Another story claims the Kipferl was invented in Vienna after or during the siege of the city by Ottoman Turks.\n\nWhen they come out of the oven, the rolls can be left plain or brushed with water to make them shiny. They can be given an egg wash and sprinkled with either poppy seeds or caraway seeds mixed with coarse salt. The latter variety is often made into a straight shape rather than a crescent. Kifli is eaten like bread or rolls; it is usually made into a sandwich, sometimes plain or with butter like a fresh baguette. Often, especially for breakfast, the topping is jam or honey. They may also be used for dunking.\nThis is the same as the regular style but the dough may contain butter or other shortening and milk. It is sweeter than the regular variety and is well-suited to be eaten with jam or honey, and is commonly eaten for breakfast with coffee, hot chocolate or milk. It might also be an accompaniment for drinks like Doogh and Kumis.\nThere are a couple of sweet rolls named \"kifli\" to describe their shape; they are eaten at the end of a meal or with an afternoon drink; these are not kifli, which when used on its own, always means the regular or fine varieties. In German, these are differentiated with a different spelling: Kipferl compared to Kipfel for the yeast bread.\nVanillekipferl is a small, very short soft cookie made from a dough of ground nuts instead of flour. It is originally made with walnuts but almonds are more often used outside of Hungary. Once baked they are rolled in vanilla-flavored confectioners' sugar then allowed to",

In addition, it is marketed in a non-edible form as a beauty product. Depending widely on the ingredients and the process used, mint chocolate can give off a very distinctive mint fragrance. The chocolate component can be milk chocolate, regular dark chocolate, or white chocolate; due to this, mint chocolate has no one specific flavor, and so each chocolate-plus-flavor combination can be unique. ...",

The \"horseshoe\" name has been variously attributed to the horseshoe-like shape of a slice of bone-in ham, or to the horseshoe-like arrangement of potato wedges around the ham. It's not uncommon to substitute other meat for the hamburger, such as chicken or ham, or use more than one type of meat. The fries may also be substituted with tater tots, waffle fries, or other forms of fried potatoes. ...",

The invention of baking powder and other chemical leavening agents during the 19th century substantially increased the flexibility of this traditional pound cake by introducing the possibility of creating lighter, fluffier cakes using these traditional combinations of ingredients, and it is this transformation that brought about the modern butter cake.\nButter cakes are traditionally made using a creaming method, in which the butter and sugar are first beaten until fluffy to incorporate air into the butter. Eggs are then added gradually, creating an emulsion, followed by alternating portions of wet and dry ingredients. Butter cakes are typically rich and moist when stored at room temperature, but they tend to stiffen, dry out, and lose flavor when refrigerated, making them unsuitable for filling or frosting in advance with ingredients that must be refrigerated, such as cream cheese frosting and pastry cream.\nButterkuchen, a German butter cake\nGooey butter cake, a St. Louis variant on butter cake\nPound cake\n\"Simple Home Recipe\".

Junket is a milk-based dessert, made with sweetened milk and rennet, the digestive enzyme that curdles milk. Some older cookery books call the dish curds and whey.\nJunket evolved from an older French dish, jonquet, a dish of renneted cream in which the whey is drained from curdled cream, and the remaining curds sweetened with sugar.\nIn medieval England, junket was a food of the nobility made with cream and flavoured with rosewater, spices and sugar. It started to fall from favour during the Tudor era, being replaced by syllabubs on fashionable banqueting tables and, by the 18th century, had become an everyday food sold in the streets.\nFor most of the 20th century in the eastern United States, junket made with milk instead of cream was a preferred food for ill children, mostly due to its sweetness and ease of digestion.\nDorothy Hartley, in her \"Food in England\", has a section on rennet followed by a section on 'Junkets, Curds and Whey or Creams'. She cites rum as the most common flavouring, and clotted cream as the 'usual accompaniment'. She notes that the practice of heating the milk to blood heat is a new one; originally, junket was made with milk as it was obtained from the cow, already at blood heat.\nThe word's etymology is uncertain. It may be related to the Norman jonquette (a kind of cream made with boiled milk, egg yolks, sugar and caramel), or to the Italian giuncata or directly to the medieval Latin juncata. The first recorded use in this sense is in \"The boke of nurture, folowyng Englondis gise\".\nThe word may also derive from the French jonches, a name for freshly made milk cheese drained in a rush basket, which itself derives from jonquet, the name for such a basket.\n1965 Otto Preminger film \"Bunny Lake is Missing\": In an early scene, a conversation about junket takes place between the cook in an English kindergarten and a young mother dropping her daughter off for her first day of school. The cook, who is preparing to serve two dozen bowls of the dessert, maintains there is no difference between good junket and poor junket. She states that both types \"taste like swill and swallow like slime\".\nLater in the film, a police superintendent (played by Laurence Olivier) eats several spoonfuls of the junket. Later still, the superintendent takes an opportunity to praise the dessert to the cook that prepared it.\nWilson, Carol (2009). Porters English Cookery Bible. Pavilion Books. p.\u00a0159.

The preparation of this bread may be accompanied by various rules and rituals. A coin is often put into the dough during the kneading; other small objects may also be inserted. At the beginning of Christmas dinner, the \u010desnica is rotated three times counterclockwise, before being broken among the family members. The person who finds the coin in his piece of the bread will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The \u010desnica was used in folk magic for divining or influencing the amount of crops.\nChristmas dinner is the most festive meal of the year. It begins about noon, or even earlier. The family members seated at the table stand up when the head of household gives a sign. The head makes the Sign of the Cross and lights a candle, before censing the gathered relatives and saying a prayer, after which they all kiss each other while saying, \"Peace of God, Christ Is Born.\" The head and another man of the family hold the \u010desnica between themselves, rotating it three times counterclockwise. The \u010desnica is then carefully broken among the relatives, so that each of them gets his own piece of the bread, without a crumb falling off.\nUp to three pieces of the loaf may be set aside: one for the absent relatives (if there are such), one for a stranger who might join the family at the dinner, and one for the polaznik, their first visitor on Christmas Day (if he is not present). The rest of the \u010desnica is consumed during the dinner. The family member who finds the coin in his piece of the bread will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The head may try to buy the coin from this lucky relative. Each of the other objects hidden in the bread indicates the segment of the household economy in which the person who finds it in his share of the \u010desnica will be especially successful.\nIn some regions, such as the Bay of Kotor and Bukovica, the \u010desnica is not broken and eaten at Christmas dinner. It is instead placed on the table or nearby, with a candle stuck into it. The head of household lights this candle at the beginning of Christmas dinner. In Bukovica, several olive or bay laurel twigs are stuck around the candle. In the Bay of Kotor, the date when the \u010desnica is eaten varies from place to place; it may be even twenty days after Christmas, on the Feast of Saint Sava. In some areas only half of the \u010desnica is consumed at Christmas dinner, the other half being eaten a week later, on the Feast of St. Basil the Great.\nThe \u010desnica may be used for divination in some regions. In Bosnia, when the dough is shaped and ready for baking, a number of notches are cut in the upper surface of it, and seeds of various crops are placed into the notches. The more a notch has risen when the \u010desnica is baked, the more productive the crop whose seed is in it will be in the following year. In Jadar, western Serbia, the number of embers of the badnjak equal to the sum of grain and livestock sorts grown by the family are taken out of the fire and placed on the \u010desnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. To ensure an abundance of grain, some people place a bowl filled with grain on the \u010desnica.\nIn 19th-century Herzegovina, two men would rotate the \u010desnica between themselves, one of them asking, \"Am I protruding [from behind the \u010desnica]?\" and the other responding, \"You are, a little.\" The first man would then say, \"Now a little, and next year not even a little.\" The purpose of this conversation was to invoke an abundance of grain in the coming year. A similar practice was recorded in the 12th century among West Slavs on the island of Rugia in the Baltic Sea. Those Slavs were adherents of the cult of Svantovit, and had a big temple dedicated to that god at Cape Arkona. Saxo Grammaticus described, in the Book XIV of his Gesta Danorum, the festival of Svantovit which was held annually after harvest in front of that temple. In one of the rituals, a round loaf of bread covered with honey, with the diameter equal to a man's height, was held vertically in front of the statue of Svantovit. The priest of the temple went behind the loaf, before asking the gathered people whether they saw him. After they responded that they did, the priest expressed the wish that next year they would not see him. The aim of the ritual was to ensure a rich harvest of grain in the following year.\nChristmas does not",

Mouna, also known as Mona is an Algerian Jewish sweet bread of Sephardi origin, similar to challah, kubaneh or brioche, that is traditionally consumed for the Jewish holidays of Mimouna and Shabbat, which is commonly found today in France, and Israel, and has a sweet taste enriched with oil and eggs and often contains anise, sesame, orange, or other citrus.\nMouna derives its name from the Jewish holiday Mimouna, a special holiday traditionally celebrated by Maghrebi Jews to mark the end of the Pesach (Passover) holiday with a feast of sweets and baked goods. Mouna likely comes from the Hebrew word emunah, meaning faith.\nMouna is a very popular bread, especially in Algerian Jewish cuisine, but also in Moroccan Jewish, Tunisian Jewish, as well as French Jewish and Israeli cuisine (owing to the large population of Maghrebi Jews in both countries). \nMouna is used in similar way as Challah is used by other Jewish communities, as the bread served for Shabbat and other holidays such as Mimouna of the Yom Kippur break fast. Mouna is a delicate and sweet bread, and also sometimes contains a filling such as jam in the center.\nAmbroise Queff\u00e9lec, Yacine Derradji, Val\u00e9ry Debov, Dalila Smaali-Dekdouk, Yasmina Cherrad-Benchefra, Le fran\u00e7ais en Alg\u00e9rie.

It is a traditional Brazilian recipe, originating in the state of Minas Gerais.\nP\u00e3o de queijo originated from Portuguese colonists like many other Brazilian foods. Enslaved people would soak and peel the cassava root and make bread rolls from it. At this time, there was no cheese in the rolls. At the end of the 19th century, more ingredients became available to the colonial community such as milk and cheese. They added milk and cheese to the tapioca roll making what we now know as p\u00e3o de queijo. It is also widely eaten in northern Argentina and is inexpensive, often sold from streetside stands by vendors carrying a heat-preserving container. In Brazil, it is also very commonly found in groceries, supermarkets and bakeries, industrialized or freshly made.\nDespite being referred to as \"bread\", the cheese bread is basically a type of starch tart cookie or sweet plus eggs, salt, vegetable oil, and cheese, with soft and elastic consistency and with a few variations.\nWith the discovery of mines near Ouro Preto in around 1700, some 20% of the Brazilian population at that time, mainly slaves, occupied a vast territory in the southeast of the then-Portuguese colony. The mass forced colonisation shifted economic hub of the colony to the southeast.\nCreatively, Minas Gerais cooks replaced the non-existent wheat with starch derived from cassava tuber shown to them by tupiniquins indigenous groups. Added this was grated hard cheese similar to Parmesan.\nThere are several different recipes of Brazilian cheese bread where the ingredients and the type of cheese vary widely \u2013 as well as the final result. Some of them use sweet starch, other sour, or even both. But what gives it its main feature is that it is based on starch cassava and some kind of cheese.\nThe fat \u2013 lard, vegetable oil, butter or margarine \u2013 acts as a molecular lubricant,\n contributing to the elastic texture of the dough.\nThe egg gives colour and flavour to the recipe.\nThe type of cheese varies according to preference or availability. The most used are mozzarella, parmesan, and (more traditionally) Minas cheese (either in its \"ripened\" or \"standard\" version).  The cheese gives the typical flavor of the cheese bread, hence its name.\nThere is also the boiled cheese bread with a preparation technique that requires boiling water while preparing, sometimes mixed with vegetable oil in flour. The boiled cheese bread has the closest taste of natural, as in the boiling process the dough is pre-cooked.\nSome recipes use potato.\n\nIn Brazil, p\u00e3o de queijo is a popular breakfast dish and snack. It continues to be widely sold at snack bars and bakeries and it can also be bought frozen to bake at home. In Brazil, cheese puff mix packages are easily found in most supermarkets.\nGiven its growing popularity in the US, the frozen packages of pao de queijo can now be found in some American grocery stores such as Costco, County Market, HEB, Publix, World Market and Whole Foods.\nP\u00e3o de queijo arrived in Japan with the dekasegi. It is usually made with rice flour instead of the cassava (tapioca) starch.\nP\u00e3o de queijo is available in Australia in specialty international food stores and some major supermarkets, including Woolworths Supermarkets as of early 2021, where it is marketed as a \"naturally gluten-free\" snack.\nCheese bun (includes list of those popular in South America)\nGoug\u00e8re (from France)\nChipa (from Paraguay)\n\"chebe \u2013 History of P\u00e3o de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread)\". www.chebe.com.

The \u010desnica is then carefully broken among the relatives, so that each of them gets his own piece of the bread, without a crumb falling off.\nUp to three pieces of the loaf may be set aside: one for the absent relatives (if there are such), one for a stranger who might join the family at the dinner, and one for the polaznik, their first visitor on Christmas Day (if he is not present). The rest of the \u010desnica is consumed during the dinner. The family member who finds the coin in his piece of the bread will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The head may try to buy the coin from this lucky relative. Each of the other objects hidden in the bread indicates the segment of the household economy in which the person who finds it in his share of the \u010desnica will be especially successful.\nIn some regions, such as the Bay of Kotor and Bukovica, the \u010desnica is not broken and eaten at Christmas dinner. It is instead placed on the table or nearby, with a candle stuck into it. The head of household lights this candle at the beginning of Christmas dinner. In Bukovica, several olive or bay laurel twigs are stuck around the candle. In the Bay of Kotor, the date when the \u010desnica is eaten varies from place to place; it may be even twenty days after Christmas, on the Feast of Saint Sava. In some areas only half of the \u010desnica is consumed at Christmas dinner, the other half being eaten a week later, on the Feast of St. Basil the Great.\nThe \u010desnica may be used for divination in some regions. In Bosnia, when the dough is shaped and ready for baking, a number of notches are cut in the upper surface of it, and seeds of various crops are placed into the notches. The more a notch has risen when the \u010desnica is baked, the more productive the crop whose seed is in it will be in the following year. In Jadar, western Serbia, the number of embers of the badnjak equal to the sum of grain and livestock sorts grown by the family are taken out of the fire and placed on the \u010desnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. To ensure an abundance of grain, some people place a bowl filled with grain on the \u010desnica.\nIn 19th-century Herzegovina, two men would rotate the \u010desnica between themselves, one of them asking, \"Am I protruding [from behind the \u010desnica]?\" and the other responding, \"You are, a little.\" The first man would then say, \"Now a little, and next year not even a little.\" The purpose of this conversation was to invoke an abundance of grain in the coming year. A similar practice was recorded in the 12th century among West Slavs on the island of Rugia in the Baltic Sea. Those Slavs were adherents of the cult of Svantovit, and had a big temple dedicated to that god at Cape Arkona. Saxo Grammaticus described, in the Book XIV of his Gesta Danorum, the festival of Svantovit which was held annually after harvest in front of that temple. In one of the rituals, a round loaf of bread covered with honey, with the diameter equal to a man's height, was held vertically in front of the statue of Svantovit. The priest of the temple went behind the loaf, before asking the gathered people whether they saw him. After they responded that they did, the priest expressed the wish that next year they would not see him. The aim of the ritual was to ensure a rich harvest of grain in the following year.\nChristmas does not",

Soda bread is a variety of quick bread traditionally made in a variety of cuisines in which sodium bicarbonate (otherwise known as \"baking soda\", or in Ireland, \"bread soda\") is used as a leavening agent instead of the traditional yeast. The ingredients of traditional soda bread are flour, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk. The buttermilk in the dough contains lactic acid, which reacts with the baking soda to form tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide. Other ingredients can be added, such as butter, egg, raisins, or nuts. An advantage of quick breads is their ability to be prepared quickly and reliably, without requiring the time-consuming skilled labor and temperature control needed for traditional yeast breads.\nDuring the early years of European settlement of the Americas, settlers used soda or pearl ash, more commonly known as potash (pot ash) or potassium carbonate, as a leavening agent (the forerunner to baking soda) in quick breads. By 1824, The   Virginia Housewife by Mary Randolph was published containing a recipe for Soda Cake.\nAfter baking soda was developed in the US in 1846, breads, griddle cakes and scones with bicarbonate of soda, plus cream of tartar or tartaric acid, became popular in European countries.\nTraditional Irish bread was historically cooked on a griddle as flatbread because the domestic flours did not have the properties needed to rise effectively when combined with yeast. Baking soda offered an alternative, but its popularity declined for a time when imported high-gluten flours became available. Brown soda bread (served with smoked salmon) reappeared on luxury hotel menus in the 1960s. Modern varieties can be found at Irish cafes and bakeries, some made with Guinness, treacle, walnuts, and herbs, but the sweetened version with caraway and raisins is rarely seen anymore. Soda bread made with raisins is colloquially called \"Spotted Dog\" or \"Spotted Dick\".\nIn Ireland, the flour is typically made from soft wheat, so soda bread is best made with a cake or pastry flour (made from soft wheat), which has lower levels of gluten than a bread flour. In some recipes, the buttermilk is replaced by live yogurt or even stout. Because the leavening action starts immediately (compared to the time taken for yeast bread to rise), bakers recommend the minimum amount of mixing of the ingredients before baking; the dough should not be kneaded.\nVarious forms of soda bread are popular throughout Ireland. Soda breads are made using wholemeal, white flour, or both. In Ulster, the wholemeal variety is usually known as wheaten bread and is normally sweetened, while the term \"soda bread\" is restricted to the white savoury form. In the southern provinces of Ireland, the wholemeal variety is usually known as brown bread and is almost identical to the Ulster wheaten. In some parts of Fermanagh, the white flour form of the bread is described as fadge.\nThe \"griddle cakes\", \"griddle bread\" (or soda farls in Ulster) take a more rounded shape and have a cross cut in the top to allow the bread to expand. The griddle cake or farl is a more flattened type of bread. It is cooked on a griddle, allowing it to take a more flat shape, and it is split into four sections. The soda farl is one of the distinguishing elements of the Ulster fry, where it is served alongside potato bread, also in farl form.\nIn Scotland, varieties of soda breads and griddle sodas include bannocks and farls (Scots: fardel, \"a fourth\"), \"soda scones\", or \"soda farls\", using baking powder or baking soda as a leavening agent giving the food a light and airy texture.\nBannocks are flat cakes of barley or oatmeal dough formed into a round or oval shape, then cooked on a griddle (Scots: girdle). The most authentic versions are unleavened, but from the early 19th century bannocks have been made using baking powder, or a combination of baking soda and buttermilk or clabbered milk. Before the 19th century, bannocks were cooked on a bannock stone (Scots: stane), a large, flat, rounded piece of sandstone, placed directly onto a fire, then used as a cooking surface. Several varieties of bannock include Selkirk bannocks, beremeal bannocks, Michaelmas bannock, Yetholm bannock, and Yule bannock.\nThe traditional soda farl is used in the full Scottish breakfast along with the potato scone (Scots: tattie scone).\nIn Serbian tradition, soda bread is prepared by various rules and rituals. A coin is often put into the dough during the kneading; other small objects may also be inserted. At the beginning of Christmas dinner, the \u010desnica is rotated three",

An Empire biscuit (Imperial biscuit, Imperial cookie, double biscuit, German biscuit, Belgian biscuit, double shortbread, Empire cookie or biscuit bun) is a sweet biscuit eaten in Scotland, and other Commonwealth countries. It is popular in Northern Ireland, and it is an iconic dish in Winnipeg,\nCanada.\nEmpire biscuit was originally known as the \"Linzer biscuit\", and later as the \"Deutsch biscuit\". With the outbreak of the First World War it was renamed:  in England to Empire biscuit, in Scotland to Belgian biscuit because Belgium had just been invaded, but in Northern Ireland it remains known as the German biscuit or biscuit bun. In Scotland the name now varies depending on the region, with the North-east typically calling it a double shortbread and the West an Empire biscuit. In Northern Ireland it is commonly found with a jam and coconut topping. It is also known as the \"Belgian biscuit\", due to being topped in a similar way to a Belgian bun, which is made of pastry or dough.\nThere also exists a biscuit similar to the Jammie Dodger which is referred to as a Linzer biscuit.\nEmpire biscuits are similar to Viennese whirls.\nKnown as a \"Belgium\" or as a \"Belgian biscuit\" in New Zealand, this type of biscuit gained popularity towards the end of the Great War and is now typically found either in biscuit or slice form. Typically, spiced biscuits are filled with raspberry jam and topped with pink or white icing, with raspberry jelly crystals scattered on top instead of the cherry. These are quite different to the Empire biscuit, which bears more similarity to a NZ 'Shrewsbury'.\nList of shortbread biscuits and cookies\nOther foods renamed for political reasons include:\nLiberty cabbage\nFreedom fries\n\"Traditional Scottish Recipes - Empire Biscuits\". www.rampantscotland.com.\nEdmonds Classics Hachette Livre, 2005. pg. 25\nReview of biscuit on Nice Cup of Tea and a Sit Down",

Jollof (/d\u0292\u0259\u02c8l\u0252f/), or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions.\nThe origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. The dish has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables. \nFood and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in \"linguistic, historical or political patterns\". \nInstead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of \"blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy\" as well as the religion of Islam. \nMarc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia. \nIt may then have spread throughout the region through the historical commercial, cultural and religious channels linking Senegal with Ghana, Nigeria and beyond, many of which continue to thrive today, such as the Tij\u0101niyyah Sufi brotherhood bringing thousands of West African pilgrims to Senegal annually.\nJollof rice is one of the most common dishes in West Africa. There are several regional variations in name and ingredients, for example, in Mali it is called zaam\u00e8 in Bamanankan. The dish's most common name of Jollof derives from the name of the Wolof people, though in Senegal and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as ceebu j\u00ebn or benachin. In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras. Despite the variations, the dish is \"mutually intelligible\" across the regions and has become the best known African dish outside the continent.\nEach West African country has at least one variant form of the dish, with Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cameroon particularly competitive as to which country makes the best jollof. This is especially prominent between Nigeria and Ghana, in a rivalry dubbed the \"Jollof Wars\".\nAlthough considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian jollof rice includes long grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, pepper, vegetable oil, onions, and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are cooked in one pot, of which a rich meat stock and a fried tomato and pepper puree characteristically forms the base. Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid. The dish is then served with the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi moi, steamed vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc. In the riverine areas of Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein, seafood often takes the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice.\nGhanaian jollof rice is made of vegetable oil, onion, bell pepper, cloves of pressed garlic, chillies, tomato paste, beef or goat meat or chicken (some times alternated with mixed vegetables), local or refined rice and black pepper. The method of cooking jollof begins with first preparing the beef or chicken by seasoning and frying it until it is well-cooked. The rest of the ingredients are then fried all together, starting from onions, pepper, tomato paste, tomatoes and spices in that order. After all the ingredients have been fried, rice is then added and cooked until the meal is prepared. Ghanaian jollof is typically served with side dishes of beef, chicken, well-seasoned fried fish, or mixed vegetables.\nJollof in Ghana is also served alongside shito, a popular type of pepper which originates from Ghana, and salad during parties and other ceremonies.\nSince the 2010s there has been increasing interest in West African foods in the western world. Jollof food festivals have been held in Washington, DC, in the US, and Toronto, Canada. \"World Jollof Day\" has been celebrated since 2015 on 22 August, gaining traction on social media.\nCharleston red rice\nJambalaya\nList of African dishes\nThieboudienne\nAyto, John (2012). \"Jollof rice\".

Although pancakes are rarely made from homemade bread dough in NL today, the memory of regional terms still exists in younger generations, such as the British English term tiffin, meaning \"small lunch\". The dish has a long list of regionally-distinct names, and can refer to two (or more) different types of baked or fried dough: the dough cake variant, usually fried; and a baked bun variant, made with pork fat. Toutons are usually served at breakfast or brunch and can still be found quite commonly on the breakfast menus of many local restaurants.",

Fried bread dough is not unique to Newfoundland and Labrador, Acadian lard-fried Croix en d'Jeu being one example from outside the region. Toutons are often made from leftover bread dough, or dough that was left to rise overnight, such as this description from North River, Conception Bay, 1966: \nRisen bread dough pulled flat like a pancake, and fried in pork fat (salt) or margarine. It was usually served for breakfast because with slow rising yeast, bread was mixed in the evening, allowed to rise during the night, and was baked the next day. \n\nThey were sometimes a treat for children, who were fed them so they wouldn\u2019t gobble up all the fresh-baked bread. There was no exact recipe for touton/bread dough in outport communities; each maker generally relied on recipes and techniques passed down orally or through observation. Folklorist Andrea McGuire documented this in an interview with Mary (Murphy) King, originally of Ship Cove, Placentia Bay, who spoke of her mother's interactions with American servicemen in the mid twentieth century: \n\nA few of the men \u201cworshipped mom for her bread and her stews and stuff like that \u2026 Another thing they never could understand were toutons.\u201d The men would ask Mary\u2019s mother for her bread and touton recipe, which baffled her a little. She would say, \u201cThere\u2019s no recipe, you just mix a bit of this and a bit of that,\u201d but as Mary put it, \u201cNow, they were just as wise as my cat would be, you know, because they couldn\u2019t understand\u2014if you didn\u2019t have a recipe, how would you make bread?\u201d \nIt is much rarer to find them cooked in fatback pork today; the toutons found in local restaurants are more likely fried in a combination of olive oil, clarified butter, or canola oil.\nOne of the most common regional names for toutons, generally found in the Bonavista Bay and Central Newfoundland region, though there are outliers in Labrador and Conception Bay North:\nSome of these terms appear remarkably limited in their regional distribution. Tiffin, for example, appears to be localized in a handful of communities in Northern Bonavista Bay, yet students from one southern Bonavista Bay community reported this term with the meaning 'small lunch', a meaning which also occurs in regional British as well as in Indian English.\nThe manufacture of tiffins is similar to descriptions given above for toutons. One 1979 account from Bonavista Bay relates,\nWhen mother was making bread and dough has risen she would cut pieces off, about the size of a doughnut and fry them. These were tiffins. Some people also call them scons but this may not be restricted to Wesleyville.\nOther versions of the word include tiffen-bread, and sintiffin.\nThe traditional accompaniment to toutons is a drizzle of molasses or pat of butter. Less common condiments could include maple syrup, sugar, corn syrup, or fruit jam, though the use of these causes consternation for some foodways purists. An alternative to straight molasses is coady (also cody or lassy coady, a molasses sauce) made thusly, \"Boil for I0 minutes - I cup molasses, 1/4 cup water, 3 tbsp. butter and I tbsp. vinegar\" or by any number of alternative recipes.\nIn some parts of Newfoundland, a touton is a baked cake or bun, often made with diced salted pork in the dough. In 1971, mother and housewife Marie Harris of Glovertown provided this \"old Nfld recipe passed on orally among friends & mothers to daughters\":\n\n...a plain tea cake made of flour, sugar, water (or milk), butter, salt & small pieces of white pork. This was well mixed until it formed a dough which was rolled to a thickness of 1/3 - 1/2 inch and then cut into circles. The cakes were baked in an ovan [sic] of 350F and eaten when ready, hot or cold (Delicious cakes). [also add baking powder to ingredients!] Not to be confused with tiffins.\nAnother typical description is the one given by Mr. Margaret Cook (born in Coachman's Cove) to folklorist John Widdowson in 1964:\nThe toutons then, you take them an' roll them up with the pork, see - pork toutons. No, no, not bread, no, just the flour. Take the flour an' put the pork in and the bakin' powders, whatever you have an' then roll them an bake ('em). That's the toutons.\nAnother regional variant that uses potatoes as the main ingredient was prepared in the Bonavista and Elliston, (Maberly) region of the Bonavista Peninsula from the early twentieth century onwards.\nBy the late 1980s to early 2000s, toutons emerged as a symbol or reminder of Newfoundland identity.

Once done, the potatoes are added to the same pot as the vegetables and all are thoroughly mashed together. Rookworst, a type of smoked sausage, is the preferred piece of meat to be added to the dish in the Netherlands. Stamppot can also be made in a single pot. Potatoes and the vegetables or fruit of choice are placed in the pot. Water is added, and the mixture is left to boil. After the vegetables are cooked and drained, some milk, butter and salt are added, and the vegetables are mashed together. Sometimes the same pot is used to warm sausage as well, but those aren't mashed in. ...",

Stamppot (English: Mash pot) is a traditional Dutch dish made from a combination of potatoes mashed with one or several vegetables.\nThese vegetable pairings traditionally include sauerkraut, endive, kale, spinach, turnip greens, or carrot and onion (the combination of the latter two is known as hutspot in the Netherlands and as wortelstoemp in Belgium). Leafy greens such as endive may be left raw and added to the potatoes only at the mashing stage. Some less common regional varieties of stamppot are made with fruit and potatoes, such as blauwe bliksem (blue lightning), made with pears, and hete bliksem (hot lightning), made with sweet apples. Pineapple may also be included in sauerkraut or endive stamppot. In recent years, variations on the traditional stamppot have been becoming more and more popular with people adding ingredients such as rocket, leeks, beets, sweet potato, mushrooms and various other vegetables. Sometimes, fish is used as an ingredient in stamppot as well instead of serving it as a separate dish. Stamppot is primarily a cold-weather dish. \nStamppot is usually served with sausage (in the Netherlands often smoked, in Belgium more often fried), julienned bacon, or stewed meat. Other accompaniments include cheese, gherkins, nuts or pickled onions.\nPrepared stamppot can be purchased from shops and supermarkets. It can also be ordered in cafe-style restaurants, but more strict recent regulations about allowed foods in taverns versus restaurants has restricted the custom of offering simple dishes in many Belgian pubs.\nThe origin of stamppot is unknown, although legend attributes the invention of hutspot to 1574. Using raw leafy vegetables instead of cooking them with the potatoes has not been dated to earlier than 1940.\nBiksemad, from Denmark\nBubble and squeak, from England\nChamp, and Colcannon, from Ireland\nRumbledethumps, from Scotland\nRoupa velha (Portuguese for \"old clothes\"), from Portugal, often made from leftovers from Cozido \u00e0 Portuguesa\nStoemp, from Belgium\nTrinxat, from the Empord\u00e0 region of Catalonia, northeast Spain, and Andorra\nCaldo verde, a Portuguese soup with similar ingredients.\n\"Andijviestamppot met ananas\" [Endive stamppot with pineapple].

                "description": "Brioche (/brio/, also UK: /bri, bri/, US: /brio, bri, bri/, French:[bij]) is a bread of French origin whose high egg and butter content gives it a rich and tender crumb. Chef Jol Robuchon described it as \"light and slightly puffy, more or less fine, according to the proportion of butter and eggs.\" It has a dark, golden, and flaky crust, frequently accentuated by an egg wash applied after proofing. Brioche is considered a Viennoiserie because it is made in the same basic way as bread, but has the richer aspect of a pastry because of the extra addition of eggs, butter, liquid (milk, water, cream, and, sometimes, brandy) and occasionally sugar. ...",

Brioche has numerous uses in cuisine and can take on various forms, served plain or filled, as coulibiac, or with many other different savory fillings, such as fillet of beef en croute, foie gras, sausage, cervelat lyonnais. Brioche can also be served with sweet fillings, especially fresh fruits, vanilla cream or jam.\nBrioche \u00e0 t\u00eate  or parisienne is perhaps the most classically recognized form: it is formed and baked in a fluted round, flared tin; a large ball of dough is placed on the bottom and topped with a smaller ball of dough to form the head (t\u00eate). Brioche Nanterre is a loaf of brioche made in a standard loaf pan. Instead of shaping two pieces of dough and baking them together, two rows of small pieces of dough are placed in the pan. Loaves are then proofed (allowed to rise) in the pan, fusing the pieces together. During the baking process the balls of dough rise further and form an attractive pattern.\nBrioche can also be made in a pan without being rolled into balls to make an ordinary loaf.\nBrioche dough contains flour, eggs, butter, liquid (milk, water, cream, and sometimes brandy), leavening (yeast or sourdough), salt, and sometimes sugar. Common recipes have a flour to butter ratio of about 2:1.\nThe normal method of preparation is to make the dough, let it rise to double its volume at room temperature and then punch it down and let it rise again in the refrigerator for varying periods (according to the recipe), retarding the dough to develop the flavor. Refrigeration also stiffens the dough, which still rises, albeit slowly, making it easier to form. The dough is then shaped, placed in containers for the final proofing, and generally brushed on top with an egg wash before being baked at 230\u00a0\u00b0C (446\u00a0\u00b0F) until the crust browns and the interior reaches at least 90\u00a0\u00b0C (194\u00a0\u00b0F). The first rise time for small rolls is 1 to 1\u00bd hours, for larger brioche the time is lengthened until the loaves double.\nThe first recorded use of the word in French dates from 1404. It is attested in 1611 in Cotgrave's A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues, where it is described as \"a rowle, or bunne, of spiced bread\" and its origin given as Norman.\nIn France it developed as \"a sort of bread improved since antiquity by generations of bakers, then of pastry-makers ... with some butter, some eggs, sugar coming later ... it developed from the blessed bread [pain b\u00e9nit] of the church which gradually became of better quality, more and more costly, less and less bread; until becoming savory brioche\". In the 17th century \"p\u00e2t\u00e9 \u00e0 tarte brioch\u00e9e\", \"a pain \u00e0 brioche pauvre [poor] ... [using only] 3 eggs and 250 grams of butter for 1 kilogram of flour\" was introduced. The terms \"pain b\u00e9nit\" and \"brioche\" were sometimes used together or virtually interchangeably; so, for example, in another 17th-century recipe entitled: \"CHAPITRE II. Pain b\u00e9nit, & brioches.\" It begins with a lighter, cheaper version of blessed bread, calling for \"a pound of fresh butter and a soft cheese [but no eggs!] for a pail of flour\"; and goes on to describe \"the more delicate that we call Cousin\", which uses 3 pounds of butter, 2 cheeses, and a royal pint of eggs for the same amount of flour, as well as \"some good milk\" if \"the dough is too firm\". However, sourdough and brewer's yeast preparations would both remain common well into the next century, with \"blessed bread ... more and more often replaced by brioche\" in the 18th century, where \"Those from Gisors and Gournay, great butter markets, were the most highly regarded.\"\nFor the wealthy \"from the time of Louis XIV onwards ... Butter, in widespread use at least in the northern half of France, was the secret of making brioches\". \"In Gisors, on market days, they produce up to 250 or 300\u00a0kg of brioches. The dough is made the evening before (1\u00a0kg of farine, a quarter of which for the starter, 10\u00a0g of yeast, 7 or 8 eggs; one mixes this together with the starter and 800\u00a0g of butter, breaking up the dough, which 'uses up the butter'). The dough is kept in a terrine, and one puts it in a mold just at the moment of baking. Thus prepared, the brioche remains light, keeps well, maintains the flavour of butter, without the stench of the starter.\" Brioche of varying degrees of richness from the rich man's with a flour to butter ratio of 3:2 to the cheaper pain brioch\u00e9 with a ratio of 4:1 existed at the same time.\nJean-Jacques Rousseau, in his autobiography Confessions, relates that \"a great princess\" is said to have advised, with regard to peasants who had no bread, \"Qu'ils mangent de la brioche\", commonly translated as  \"Let them eat cake\". This saying is commonly misattributed to Queen Marie-Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI.\nAlthough there has been much debate about the etymology of the word and,",

Zeeuws spek (pronounced [ze\u02d0ws \u02c8sp\u025bk]; \"Zeelandic bacon\") is a traditional Dutch bacon, originally a specialty from the province of Zeeland. Traditionally, it is seasoned with salt, pepper and herbs such as bay leaf, and slow-cooked. Modern Zeeuws spek is marinated, and then grilled, broiled, or smoked.\nTraditionally, Zeeuws spek is eaten on whole grain bread with mustard; other uses include serving it as an hors d'\u0153uvre, on a salad, or with baked potatoes. A notable sandwich with Zeeuws spek is made in Vermaat restaurant, in IJsselstein; Ronald van der Kruk uses Zeeuws spek, bacon, katenspek (bacon which is boiled before it is smoked), and ontbijtspek (\"breakfast bacon\").\nZeeuws spek continues to be held in high regard as a Zeeland dish, though in Zeeland it is also used in fusion foods, such as the Dutch/Indonesian/Chinese fusion dish babi panggang.\nThe national organization of butchers, Slavakto, organizes a competition to determine the best Zeeuws spek in the country. In 2007, the prize went to Jacco van Zoonen of Nieuwe Niedorp. In 2008, the award went to Niek Kramer of Anna Paulowna.

In other countries of the Arabian Peninsula it is also called ma'booj (Arabic: \u0645\u0639\u0628\u0648\u062c\u200e).\nThe word Sahawiq comes from the Arabic root (s-\u1e25-q) which means to pestle or to crush.\nVarieties in Yemen include sahawiq akhdar (green sahawiq), sahawiq ahmar (red sahawiq), and sahawiq bel-jiben (sahawiq with cheese, usually Yemeni cheese). Sahawiq is one of the main ingredients of Saltah. Wazif (traditional Yemeni dried baby sardines) is sometimes added to the Sahawiq's ingredients and it is known as Sahawiq Wazif (Arabic: \u0633\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0642 \u0648\u0632\u0641\u200e).\nIn Israel, one can find skhug adom (\"red zhug\"), skhug yarok (\"green zhug\") and skhug khum (\"brown zhug\"), which has added tomatoes. \"Red zhug\" is made with red peppers while \"green zhug\" is made with green peppers, or jalape\u00f1os. Zhug may be referred to by the generic term harif (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05e3\u200e; lit. \"hot/spicy\").

According to one source, American William W. Kolb invented the red candy apple.\n\nKolb, a veteran Newark candy-maker, produced his first batch of candied apples in 1908. While experimenting in his candy shop with red cinnamon candy for the Christmas trade, he dipped some apples into the mixture and put them in the windows for display. He sold the whole first batch for 5 cents each and later sold thousands yearly. Soon candied apples were being sold along the Jersey Shore, at the circus and in candy shops across the country, according to the Newark News in 1948.\nCandy apples are made by coating an apple with a layer of sugar that has been heated to hard crack stage. The most common sugar coating is made from sugar (white or brown), corn syrup, water, cinnamon and red food coloring. Humid weather can prevent the sugar from hardening.\nAustralia \u2013 the Granny Smith variety of apple is considered ideal for creating the children's treat.\nBrazil \u2013 candy apples (named as in other Lusophone countries ma\u00e7\u00e3 do amor, as in the French pommes d'amour, meaning \"apples of love\") are common in the festivities in honor of John the Apostle.\nChina \u2013 a similar treat called Tanghulu is made by coating small fruits, traditionally hawthorns with hard sugar syrup.\nCanada \u2013 very popular and usually eaten at fairs or carnivals.\nFrance \u2013 candy apples are called pommes d'amour (apples of love). They are a common treat found at many festivals in France.\nGermany \u2013 most often associated with the Christmas season. They are also sometimes sold at carnivals and fairs\nIsrael \u2013 almost solely sold in cities' squares on Yom Ha'atzmaut eve (Israel Independence Day) as part of the street celebrations.\nJapan \u2013 candy apples, grapes, strawberries and tangerines are commonly available at Japanese festivals.\nRepublic of Ireland \u2013 eaten at Halloween.\nUnited Kingdom \u2013 a similar treat made with toffee is associated with and eaten at Halloween (Scotland and Northern Ireland), Bonfire Night (England and Wales).\nUnited States \u2013 jelly apples, found in New York's Coney Island area, are related but have a soft candy (\"jelly\") coating and a cherry flavor, not cinnamon.\nSouth Africa - Toffee apples are mostly available at supermarkets like Checkers and Spar. They are also very popular throughout apple season.Mostly dipped in red or green coloured sugar syrup.\nList of apple dishes\nLollipop\nThisisSouthDevon (October 9, 2008). \"Apples galore as event grows\".

It may be a long, narrow sandwich, a triangular half-sandwich, or a small biscuit. It may also be cut into other decorative shapes with a cookie cutter. The bread is traditionally white, thinly sliced, and buttered. The bread crust is cut away cleanly from the sandwich after the sandwich has been prepared but before serving.

Stamppot (English: Mash pot) is a traditional Dutch dish made from a combination of potatoes mashed with one or several vegetables.\nThese vegetable pairings traditionally include sauerkraut, endive, kale, spinach, turnip greens, or carrot and onion (the combination of the latter two is known as hutspot in the Netherlands and as wortelstoemp in Belgium). Leafy greens such as endive may be left raw and added to the potatoes only at the mashing stage. Some less common regional varieties of stamppot are made with fruit and potatoes, such as blauwe bliksem (blue lightning), made with pears, and hete bliksem (hot lightning), made with sweet apples. Pineapple may also be included in sauerkraut or endive stamppot. In recent years, variations on the traditional stamppot have been becoming more and more popular with people adding ingredients such as rocket, leeks, beets, sweet potato, mushrooms and various other vegetables. Sometimes, fish is used as an ingredient in stamppot as well instead of serving it as a separate dish. Stamppot is primarily a cold-weather dish. \nStamppot is usually served with sausage (in the Netherlands often smoked, in Belgium more often fried), julienned bacon, or stewed meat. Other accompaniments include cheese, gherkins, nuts or pickled onions.\nPrepared stamppot can be purchased from shops and supermarkets. It can also be ordered in cafe-style restaurants, but more strict recent regulations about allowed foods in taverns versus restaurants has restricted the custom of offering simple dishes in many Belgian pubs.\nThe origin of stamppot is unknown, although legend attributes the invention of hutspot to 1574. Using raw leafy vegetables instead of cooking them with the potatoes has not been dated to earlier than 1940.\nBiksemad, from Denmark\nBubble and squeak, from England\nChamp, and Colcannon, from Ireland\nRumbledethumps, from Scotland\nRoupa velha (Portuguese for \"old clothes\"), from Portugal, often made from leftovers from Cozido \u00e0 Portuguesa\nStoemp, from Belgium\nTrinxat, from the Empord\u00e0 region of Catalonia, northeast Spain, and Andorra\nCaldo verde, a Portuguese soup with similar ingredients.\n\"Andijviestamppot met ananas\" [Endive stamppot with pineapple].

Pichelsteiner is a German stew that contains several kinds of meat and vegetables.\nThe creation of this dish has been traced to Auguste Winkler (n\u00e9e Kiesling).  Originally from Kirchberg im Wald, she worked as an innkeeper in Grattersdorf, where she is also buried.\nThe name is likely to have derived from the nearby B\u00fcchelstein mountain, where the annual B\u00fcchelsteiner Fest has been celebrated since 1839. As early as the 40th anniversary in 1879, the open-air-cooking festival was considered a tradition, and because the letter \u00fc is pronounced like i in the local dialect, the dish's name developed.\nIn Regen, a town in the Bavarian Forest, the citizens have met annually since 1874 on Kirchweih Monday to eat Pichelsteiner together, a tradition that is still alive today. They also claim the name's etymology. In their opinion, it derives from the pot in which the stew is cooked, which was called a pichel in the past, but this version is highly questioned by Bavarian researcher Max Peinkofer.\nThe dish was first mentioned in a cookbook in 1894.\nBavarian cuisine\nBosnian pot\nIrish stew\nList of stews\nNikujaga\nSwabian cuisine\nMax Peinkofer, \"B\u00fcchelsteinerfest und B\u00fcchelsteinerfleisch\" [The festival and meats of B\u00fcchelstein (a mountain in Bavaria, Germany)] in: Der Brunnkorb [a fountain in the town of Tittling, Bavaria, Germany], (Passau, Germany: Verlag Passavia, 1977), ISBN\u00a03-87616-060-X\nArticle in German",

Pichelsteiner is a German stew that contains several kinds of meat and vegetables.\nThe creation of this dish has been traced to Auguste Winkler (n\u00e9e Kiesling).  Originally from Kirchberg im Wald, she worked as an innkeeper in Grattersdorf, where she is also buried.\nThe name is likely to have derived from the nearby B\u00fcchelstein mountain, where the annual B\u00fcchelsteiner Fest has been celebrated since 1839. As early as the 40th anniversary in 1879, the open-air-cooking festival was considered a tradition, and because the letter \u00fc is pronounced like i in the local dialect, the dish's name developed.\nIn Regen, a town in the Bavarian Forest, the citizens have met annually since 1874 on Kirchweih Monday to eat Pichelsteiner together, a tradition that is still alive today. They also claim the name's etymology. In their opinion, it derives from the pot in which the stew is cooked, which was called a pichel in the past, but this version is highly questioned by Bavarian researcher Max Peinkofer.\nThe dish was first mentioned in a cookbook in 1894.\nBavarian cuisine\nBosnian pot\nIrish stew\nList of stews\nNikujaga\nSwabian cuisine\nMax Peinkofer, \"B\u00fcchelsteinerfest und B\u00fcchelsteinerfleisch\" [The festival and meats of B\u00fcchelstein (a mountain in Bavaria, Germany)] in: Der Brunnkorb [a fountain in the town of Tittling, Bavaria, Germany], (Passau, Germany: Verlag Passavia, 1977), ISBN\u00a03-87616-060-X\nArticle in German",

Soy yogurt, also referred to as Soya yogurt, Soygurt or Yofu (a portmanteau of yogurt and tofu), is yogurt prepared with soy milk.\nSoy yogurt is made using soy milk, adding yogurt bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus), sometimes adding sweeteners such as  fructose, glucose, or sugar.\nIt is suitable for vegans, ovo-vegetarians, for people with PKU or other dangerous diseases, and for those with lactose intolerance or milk allergy, as the bacteria for shop-bought soy yogurt are usually not grown on a dairy base. Due to certain recurring doubts and controversies about the bacterial cultures used, most soy yogurt manufacturers nowadays include certified labels, usually by the Vegan Society or similar vegan organisations, clearly visible on the outer packaging.\nSoy yogurt may have a slight beany soy taste when made directly from freshly prepared soy milk, but this is less pronounced in shop-bought soy yogurt and in soy yogurt made from commercial soy milk.\nSoy yogurt contains less fat than yogurt made with whole milk. This amounts to about 2.7% (the same percentage as soy milk), versus 3.5% in dairy yogurt. However, dairy yogurt can be made with 2%, 1%, or fat-free milk, and soy yogurt can also be made from reduced-fat soy milk.\nIn 1998, the cost of soy yogurt was similar to dairy yogurt.\nSoy yogurt is similar in protein content to dairy yogurt, lower in sugar, and higher in fat. If not fortified, soy yogurt does not contain vitamin B12 or vitamin D.\nPlant-based milks have different structures and components than dairy milk. Though they can be used to make many products similar to those made from dairy, there are differences in taste and texture. For example, \"soy, almond, [and] coconut yogurts do not have the same delicate and smooth structure that conventional yogurts have.\" Since plant-based milks do not contain lactose (the food of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus), plant-based yogurts usually contain different bacterial strains than a dairy yogurt, such as Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Plant-based yogurts also vary considerably in their nutrition and ingredients, and may contain gums, stabilizers, high-intensity sweeteners, and artificial colors.\nIn Europe, companies may not market their plant-based products using the word \"yogurt\" since that term is reserved for products of animal origin only \u2014 per European Union regulation 1308/2013 and a 2017 ruling in the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nList of soy-based foods\nSoy milk\nPlant milk\nSoy yogurt\nHow to make soy yogurt\nLightowler, Helen; Davies, Jill (1 January 1998). \"The vegan dairy\".

White pudding, oatmeal pudding or (in Scotland) mealy pudding is a meat dish popular in Scotland, Ireland, Northumberland, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. \nWhite pudding is broadly similar to black pudding, but does not include blood. Modern recipes consist of suet or fat, oatmeal or barley, breadcrumbs and in some cases pork and pork liver, filled into a natural or cellulose sausage casing. Recipes in previous centuries included a wider range of ingredients.\nWhite pudding is often thought of as a very old dish that, like black pudding, was a traditional way of making use of offal following the annual slaughter of livestock. Whereas black pudding-type recipes appear in Roman sources, white pudding likely has specifically medieval origins, possibly as a culinary descendant of medieval sweetened blancmange-type recipes combining shredded chicken, rice and almonds, or as a way of lightening up offal with the addition of cream, eggs and breadcrumbs. Meatless versions were common, as they could be eaten during the Lenten period of abstinence. Many older recipes are sweetened: a 15th century British pudding combined pork liver, cream, eggs, breadcrumbs, raisins and dates, while a 1588 recipe collection featured a white pudding made of beef suet, breadcrumbs, egg yolk and currants, flavoured with nutmeg, sugar and cinnamon. A similar recipe given in Woolley's 1670 book The Queen-Like Closet used hog's lights and was filled into intestine sausage-skins. By the mid-18th century, Elizabeth Raffald's white pudding recipe, \"White Puddings in Skins\", combined rice, lard, ground almonds, currants and egg, using sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and mace as flavourings; by this period the inclusion of offal such as liver or lights, as well as sweet flavourings, was becoming rarer.\nAn oatmeal pudding recipe found in the 18th century Compleat Housewife is made with beef suet and cream, thickened with oatmeal and mixed up with egg yolks, then baked in a dish with marrow.\nAlongside these more refined and elaborate recipes, a simpler form of white pudding was popular in Ireland, Scotland, and some parts of Northern England, combining suet, oatmeal (or barley in Northumberland), seasoning and onions, in sheep's or cow's intestines.  In Gaelic speaking parts of Scotland and Ireland they were referred to by the names marag gheal or put\u00f3g bh\u00e1n. These oatmeal-based puddings survived into modern Irish and Scottish cuisine, although with significant regional differences. Modern commercially made Scottish white puddings are generally based on oatmeal, onions, and beef suet; the same mixture simply fried in a pan is known as skirlie. In Ireland, white puddings also include a substantial proportion of pork or pork liver and pork fat. Most modern white puddings are filled into a synthetic cellulose casing and boiled or steamed; typical spices used include white pepper, nutmeg, and sage.\nWhite puddings were once also associated with south-western England: Taylor, in the 17th century, mentions \"the white puddings of Somersetshire\". Hog's pudding, still made in Somerset, Cornwall and Devon, is very similar to other white puddings although is somewhat more highly spiced.\nAnother Scottish variant, fruit pudding, includes dried fruit in addition to beef suet and oatmeal.\nBoudin\nGoetta\nHaggis\nRed pudding\nScrapple\nList of Irish dishes\nSee, for instance, James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man: \"White pudding and eggs and sausages and cups of tea!

It is made with red meat\u2014traditionally lamb, mutton, or goat\u2014and coloured and flavoured primarily by alkanet flower (or root) and Kashmiri chilies. It is one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine.\nA number of origins of the name have been suggested. Roughan means \"clarified butter\" or \"oil\" in Persian and Urdu, while ju\u0161 (alternatively romanised josh) means to \"stew\" or \"braise\" and ultimately derives from the verb ju\u0161idan meaning \"to boil\". Rogan josh, by this definition, may mean \"stewed in ghee\".\nAn alternative etymology is that the name derives from either the Urdu word roghan (Urdu: \u0631\u0648\u063a\u0646\u200e), \"brown\" or \"red\", or the Kashmiri roghan, \"red\", along with the word either for \"meat\", (go\u0161t) often romanized as \"rogan ghosht\" or \"gosht\", or a word meaning \"juice\", giving possible meanings of \"red meat\" or \"red juice\". The exact etymology remains uncertain as both \"rogan josh\" and \"rogan ghosht\" are used to refer to the dish and it is unclear which of the names is the original.\nRogan josh is a staple of Kashmiri cuisine and is one of the main dishes of the Kashmiri multicourse meal (the wazwan). The dish was originally brought to Kashmir by the Mughals, whose cuisine was, in turn, influenced by Persian cuisine. The unrelenting summer heat of the Indian plains took the Mughals frequently to Kashmir, which has a cooler climate because of its elevation and latitude.\nWhile the traditional preparation uses whole dried chilies that are de-seeded, soaked in water, and ground to a paste, non-traditional shortcuts use either Kashmiri chili powder (available in Indian stores) or a mixture of paprika (predominantly) and cayenne pepper, adjusted to taste. (Madhur Jaffrey's recipe calls for a 4:1 ratio of paprika to cayenne.) An updated version served in Sanjeev Kapoor's restaurants uses white and black cardamom, anise, and bay leaves.\nMany western interpretations of the dish add tomatoes to the sauce. This is especially common with ready-made pour-over cooking sauces to the point where the dish may be considered tomato-based. The authenticity of including tomatoes is disputed: some authors state that tomatoes are not part of the traditional dish or of traditional Indian cuisine and should not be included. However, other authors have specifically referred to rogan josh as a dish based around meat and tomatoes, while others have identified tomatoes with a Punjabi version of the dish as opposed to a Kashmiri one.\nIn India, rogan josh is often made with goat instead of mutton, due to its wider availability. There is a variety with beef as well, brisket being preferred.\nRogan Josh, Oxford Learners' Dictionary\nMagon, Harminder Singh (2016). My Epicurean Journey.

Fatoot samneh (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05d8\u05d0\u05d5\u05d8 \u05e1\u05de\u05e0\u05d4\u200e) is a dish originating in Yemeni cuisine, consisting of pieces of saluf or malawach (Yemeni flatbreads), or pita, that have been fried in clarified butter and combined with beaten egg. It is commonly served as a breakfast or dinner dish. It was brought to Israel by Yemenite Jews. It is somewhat similar to the Jewish matzah brei or the Mexican-American migas, which are made with matzo, and corn tortillas, respectively; whereas fatoot samneh is made with pita bread.\nFatoot samneh originated as a way for the Yemenite Jewish community to use and repurpose stale pita bread that would have otherwise been discarded. The Yemenite Jewish community was historically very poor, and most of their meals consisted of various soups and stews. Bread such as pita was very valuable, as was \"samneh\", or clarified butter, and their families were often large and the women of the community traditionally had to make do and cook as many meals as possible from their limited resources to feed their families. Over time fatoot samneh became a popular, and traditional dish among the Yemenite Jews as both a way to use up stale pita bread that was past its prime, as well as a popular breakfast or dinner dish.\nFatoot samneh consists of pita bread or some other flatbread such as saluf, laffa, or malawach, that was often leftover from another use or stale, and has been torn or cut into pieces and fried until crisp in a large amount of samneh (clarified butter), although butter or chicken schmaltz are also sometimes used. The mixture is combined with beaten/scrambled eggs, and cooked together in a manner similar to matzah brei or migas. In Israel it is traditionally topped with honey as a sweet dish, although savory versions also exist and some top it with labneh, tahini, shkug, resek avganiyot (grated tomatoes), among other toppings. Fatoot samneh has been compared by some to various dishes such as matzo brei, and migas, among others.\nMarks, Gil. The Encyclopedia of Jewish Food.\nKoenig, Leah. The Jewish Cookbook.

The origin of the dish is claimed by both the Southern regions of Campania and Sicily. Other variations found outside Italy may include chicken, veal, or another type of meat cutlet or vegetable filling.\nThere are several theories about the origin of the dish. Most frequently its invention is attributed to either Parma, Sicily or Naples. The case for Parma is that Parmigiana refers to Parma and because Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese is produced there. Sicilian food writers have several different explanations for a Sicilian origin. According to author Pino Correnti the word parmigiana derives from the Sicilian word for damigiana, a wicker sleeve used both for wine bottles and the hot casserole in which the dish would be prepared and served. Authors Mary Taylor Simeti, Vincent Schiavelli, and several others write that the name derives from the Sicilian word for louver, palmigiana. The angled horizontal slats of a louver would resemble the layering of eggplant slices in the dish. Writer Franca Colonna Romano Apostolo suggests that the name is parmiciana, which means Persian in Sicilian.\nAuthor Clifford Wright argues that the case for Parma is not convincing because Parmigiano-Reggiano was already widely traded since the 14th century. Parmigiano-Reggiano also was not an important ingredient in the original dish. Because eggplant was first introduced to Sicily and the other southern regions, it is more likely that an eggplant dish was invented there. Finally, the dish is popular in Campania in general, Naples in particular, as well as Sicily and Calabria, but not in Parma. Wright considers the case for a Sicilian origin speculative because there is no evidence to support it.\nWright traces the origin of parmigiana to Naples. The ancestor of the modern dish appears in Vincenzo Corrado's cookbook Il cuoco galante from 1786. His recipe described eggplant seasoned with butter, herbs, cinnamon, other spices and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, which was then covered with a cream sauce of egg yolks before being baked in an oven. The modern version with Parmigiano-Reggiano and tomato rag\u00f9 as key ingredients appears several years later in Ippolito Cavalcanti's cookbook Cucina teorico-pratica which was published in Naples in 1837. According to Wright this suggests that the dish evolved in Naples during this time frame, which coincided with the increasing popularity of the tomato in Italian cuisine. Author Marlena Spieler agrees with a Neapolitan origin of the dish for the same reasons.\nIn Naples, Parmigiana is also prepared using zucchini or artichokes in place of eggplants.\nIn Apulia, Parmigiana is prepared not only frying eggplants but also breading them\nVariations made with breaded meat cutlets, such as veal and chicken, have been popularized in other countries, usually in areas of Italian immigration. In such areas the original dish may be called eggplant parmigiana to distinguish it from the meat versions.\nIn the United States and Canada, chicken parmigiana and veal parmigiana are often served as a main course often with a side of pasta. Chicken parmigiana is also served as the filling of a submarine sandwich. The alternative anglicization Parmesan is sometimes used instead, and the abbreviated form parm is common. The use of meats as an alternate to eggplant originated in the United States, where it was influenced by similar Italian dishes. A similar veal dish is known in Italian as Cotoletta alla bolognese, which excludes tomato sauce but includes melted Parmesan cheese and prosciutto. Costolette Parmigiana is another similar veal dish, but in Italy it is generally served without sauce or cheese. \nChicken parmigiana is also a common dish in Australia and is often served with a side of chips or salad. In Australia, where the name is often shortened to parma or parmi, it may also contain a variety of toppings, including sliced ham or bacon.\nIn Argentina and in other neighboring South American countries, veal or chicken parmigiana is topped with ham and served with french fries. It is known as milanesa a la napolitana. If the dish is topped with a fried egg, it is known as Milanesa a caballo, but omits the tomato sauce.\nIn England, the parmo uses either pork or chicken topped with b\u00e9chamel sauce instead of tomato sauce.\nList of eggplant dishes\nList of veal dishes\nCarne pizzaiola\nWright, Clifford A. \"A History of Eggplant Parmesan\".

Given these restrictions, some individuals will make lasagna by substituting matzo for traditional wheat pasta sheets. Some people substitute cottage cheese or farmers cheese and abstain from ricotta cheese during Passover as Kosher-for-Passover varieties are difficult to find.\nMatzo lasagna descended from a local Italian Jewish variant of a much older Sephardic culinary tradition of Passover pies, or casseroles, called minas. Minas are composed of sheets of matzo layered with savory ingredients and baked. Some have ground lamb in a tomato sauce; others may be made with spinach and cheese similar to the Israeli bourekas but made with matzo instead of phyllo or puff pastry.\nMatzo lasagna can be made with regular, shmura, egg matzo, or gluten-free matzo, and fillings include tomato sauce, ricotta cheese and mozzarella-basil filling, while some use fresh mozzarella, a spinach-ricotta filling, and cheese with ramps, peas spinach, leeks and chives.\nMatzah pizza\nMatzo mina\nGebrochts\nMatzah brei\nMatzo balls\nMatzoquiles\nChremslach\n\"Matzoh Lasagna\".

It soon became popular all over the Soviet Union.\nThe cake has become one of the symbols of Kyiv, particularly by its brand name and package, depicting the horse chestnut leaf, the informal coat of arms of Kyiv.\nThe cake has two airy layers of meringue with hazelnuts, chocolate glaze, and a buttercream-like filling.\nOnce confectioners forgot to put some amount of egg-white for the biscuit in a cooler. The next morning the chef Kostyantyn Petrenko, with the help of 17-year-old assistant Nadia Chornohor, in order to hide the mistake of his colleagues, spread frozen cakes with buttercream, strewed with powder, decorated with floral ornaments.\nThe recipe of the Kyiv cake has changed with time: in the 1970s, bakers perfected the process of making egg-white and nut mixture, then started to add hazelnut in cake and began experimenting with peanuts and cashews. However, these expensive nuts increased the cake's cost so the factory returned to using hazelnuts.\nDacquoise\nPavlova\nSans rival\nSpanische Windtorte\n\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 (in Ukrainian).

                "description": "Lane cake, also known as prize cake or Alabama Lane cake, is a bourbon-laced baked cake traditional in the American South. According to food scholar Neil Ravenna, the inventor was Emma Rylander Lane, of Clayton, Alabama, who won first prize with it at the county fair in Columbus, Georgia. She called it \"Prize Cake\" when she self-published a cookbook, A Few Good Things to Eat in 1898. Her published recipe included raisins, pecans, and coconut, and called for the layers to be baked in pie tins lined with ungreased brown paper rather than in cake pans. The Lane cake is sometimes confused with the Lady Baltimore cake, which also is a liquor-laden fruit-filled cake, but of different pedigree. ...",

The cake has a reputation as being difficult to make, but this is no longer as true as it once was. When the recipe originated, there were no stand mixers, nor electric hand mixers, and even hand-crank eggbeaters were not universally available, which meant a lot of hard labor beating egg whites to frothy soft peaks. The wood-fired ovens of the time had no thermostats, making it difficult to produce a white cake. The pecans, raisins and coconut had to be chopped by hand or, more often, put through a meat grinder.  The filling ingredients can be chopped in an electric food processor today. Modern refrigeration also makes it easier to produce a stiff filling, allowing one to build an orderly multi-layer cake, rather than a sticky, lopsided dessert. Even with modern conveniences, making a traditional Lane cake is still quite a task to undertake. It is still a special cake, best made several days in advance of an important family event, so the flavors have time to mingle. During the war, Lane cakes were a favorite among service men lucky enough to receive one for Christmas. By the time the cake arrived overseas, the spirits, raisins and cake had fermented into a special delight. Many southern families have stories of \"the best cake ever tasted\".\nRecipes for Lane cake vary because so many Southern cooks who made Lane cake for special occasions fiercely guarded their recipes. Some lucky cooks use a recipe passed down from generation to generation, while many others rely on vague instructions and a variety of sources in an attempt to recreate the family tradition. One such cook, Atlanta baker and Alabama native Lise Ode wrote about such an attempt and shares the recipe she created on her blog. Professional chef Tori Avey includes a recipe for Lane cake on her website complete with pictures of each step. Although it is difficult to locate a copy of Emma Rylander Lane's original cookbook or the revised edition published in 1989, Some Good Things to Eat, the recipe can be found in many older cookbooks.  One such cookbook, The Purefoy Hotel Cook Book published in Talladega, Alabama in 1953 has been digitized and can be accessed through the Digital Public Library of America. The recipe for Lane cake appears on page 123\u2013124.\nKrystina Castella and Terry Lee Stone include a recipe for Lane cake in their cookbook Booze Cakes: Confections Spiked With Spirits, Wine, and Beer which uses 2 tablespoons of bourbon in the cake, 1 cup in the filling, and a buttercream frosting made from 1 cup unsalted butter, 1/4 cup half-and-half, 3 cups confectioner's sugar, 1/4 cup bourbon, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.\nThe original recipe for Lane cake called for 1/4 cup bourbon added to the filling mixture only, although the bourbon was sometimes replaced with grape juice by cooks who didn't want to use alcohol. Whisky, wine, and brandy are mentioned in other recipes. Still other Lane cake cooks took great pride in using a homemade liqueur,  such as scuppernong wine, making their cakes all the more special and harder to duplicate. Many cooks placed the finished Lane cake in a covered tin and allowed it to \"set\" for up to a week before serving, in order for the spongy cake to \"soak up\" the flavor. Some also wrapped the unfrosted cake in a cloth that had been soaked in the bourbon, brandy, wine, or grape juice while it set in a cool place, often in a bowl set inside a dishpan and then covered. It was then frosted with 7-minute boiled icing or other whipped white frosting, usually a day or more before serving.\nIn Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, a Lane cake is given as a welcome gift to Aunt Alexandra by Miss Maudie Atkinson. The narrator in the story is the young daughter, Scout, of Atticus Finch. Scout reports, \"Miss Maudie baked a Lane cake so loaded with shinny it made me tight.\" \"Shinny\" is a slang term for liquor.\nAlso in To Kill a Mockingbird, Miss Maudie bakes a Lane cake for Mr. Avery, who was severely injured in an attempt to put out a fire in her home. \u201cMr. Avery will be in bed for a week\u2014he\u2019s right stove up. He\u2019s too old to do things like that and I told him so. Soon as I can get my hands clean and when Stephanie Crawford\u2019s not looking, I\u2019ll make him a Lane cake. That Stephanie\u2019s been after my recipe for thirty years, and if she thinks I\u2019ll give it to her just because I\u2019m staying with her she\u2019s got another think coming.\u201d\nIn Jimmy Carter's memoir Christmas in Plains, he writes: \"I guess it would be more accurate to say that Mama never liked to cook, and welcomed my father into the kitchen whenever he was willing. He was always the one who prepared battercakes or waffles for breakfast, and he would",

Typically a sugar solution or syrup is made and heated until it browns and becomes thick, producing a caramelized candy syrup. This hot candy is then mixed with popped popcorn, and allowed to cool. Sometimes, a candy thermometer is used, as making caramel is time-consuming and requires skill to make well without burning the sugar. The process creates a sweet flavored, crunchy snack food or treat. Some varieties, after coating with the candy syrup, are baked in an oven to crisp the mixture.

This fritter is usually topped with powdered sugar, and may be filled with custard, jelly, cannoli-style pastry cream, or a butter-and-honey mixture. The consistency ranges from light and puffy, to bread- or pasta-like. It is eaten to celebrate Saint Joseph's Day, which is a Catholic feast day.",

Zeppole are typical of Italian cuisine, especially that of Rome and Naples.  They are also served in Sicily, on the island of Malta, and in Italian communities in Canada and the United States. The Sardinian tzipulas, even though they are often italianized to zeppole, are somewhat different. Zeppole are known by other names, including Bign\u00e8 di San Giuseppe (in Rome), St. Joseph's Day cake, and sfinge. Zeppole are traditionally consumed during the Festa di San Giuseppe (Saint Joseph's Day) celebrated every March 19, when zeppole are sold on many streets and sometimes presented as gifts.\nIn Istria, Croatia this pastry is called blenzi in the Croatian speaking places and zeppole in the Italian-speaking places. They are always topped with sugar either powdered or coarse.\nThe custom was popularized in the early 19th century by Neapolitan baker Pasquale Pintauro.\nThe terms zeppole and sfinge are also used to refer to baked cream puffs made from choux pastry.\nSome zeppole are filled with ricotta mixed with small pieces of chocolate, candied fruits and honey. In some parts of the U.S., they are called crispellis.\nZeppole can also be savory, and consist of fried bread dough often filled with anchovy. In parts of Calabria, the anchovy or a sultana variety are consumed on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. In Malta, anchovy zeppoli are traditionally consumed during the Lent fasting period. This version of savoury zeppole are known locally as Sfinge. The sweet version is also available in many confectioneries.\nIn the region of Frosinone in Southern Lazio the term \"Sfinge\" refers to a mixture of ricotta, sugar and eggs with the flour, which can then be flavored with vanilla, almond, etc. It is still fried in ball shapes served covered with confectioner's sugar.\nList of pastries\nList of custard desserts\nList of doughnut varieties\nBeignet\nLoukoumades\nSufganiyah\nZippuli\nPettole\n\"Zippole\" (in Spanish).\n\"Ditzion\u00e0riu in l\u00ednia de sa limba e de sa cultura sarda\".\nBrown, Ellen (2015).

Hallaca ([a\u02c8\u028eaka], [a\u02c8\u029daka]; alt. spelling, hayaca and ayaca) is a tamal from Venezuela. It consists of corn dough stuffed with a stew of beef, pork, or chicken and other ingredients such as  raisins, capers, and olives. Hallacas are folded in plantain leaves, tied with strings, and boiled; The dish is traditionally served during the Christmas season and has several regional variants in Venezuela.  It has been described as a national dish of Venezuela but it can be found also in variants. Some speculate it originated from the Orinoquia. A characteristic of the hallaca is the delicate corn dough made with consomm\u00e9 or broth and lard colored with annatto. Hallacas are also commonly consumed in eastern Cuba, Trinidad where it is referred to as pastelle, as well as parts of Colombia, Ecuador, Aruba, and Cura\u00e7ao. In Nicaragua it is known as \u201cNacatamal\u201d.\nHallaca is a Mesoamerican tamal-like dish that goes by various names and spread throughout the Spanish kingdoms in the Americas as far south as Argentina in the decades following the conquest. It is said to have been invented by slaves during the colonial era. The slaves would prepare the Christmas Eve meal for the landowners and with leftover meat they made the hallacas filling for their own Christmas meal. One version of the dishes origin tale has it that the daughter of the landowning family asked to taste the hallacas. She and her family liked the dish so much they requested for it to be made for their dinner party and ever since it has been part of the traditional holiday meal for all economic classes.\nAccording to Adolfo Ernst, the word hallaca evolved from the indigenous Guarani language, stemming from the verb ayua or ayuar, meaning \"to mix or blend\". From there, the construction ayuaca (mixed things) devolved to ayaca and ultimately to hayaca or hallaca (using Spanish silent \"h\" when written).

As suggested by its name, red tortoise cakes are traditionally red in color and has a sticky, chewy texture when eaten.\nRed tortoise cakes are shaped like tortoise shells because the Chinese traditionally believed that eating tortoises would bring longevity to those who are eating it and bring about good fortune and prosperity.\nConsidered to be auspicious items, these sweet pastries are especially prepared during important festivals such as Chinese New Year as offerings to the Chinese deities.\nRed tortoise cakes are also prepared for occasions that are culturally important to the Chinese such as a newborn baby's first month or birthdays of the elderly. Eating red tortoise cakes during these times is meant to represent blessings for the child and longevity for the elderly. In modern times, red tortoise cakes continue to be important food items during Chinese festivals in many countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, China and Taiwan and southern Thailand provinces such as Phuket, Phang-Nga and Trang. However, eating red tortoise cakes in these countries is no longer restricted to special occasions for red tortoise cakes are also commercially available in many pastry shops and bakeries.\nThere are two main components in red tortoise cakes, the skin and the filling. The skin is made mostly from glutinous rice flour and sweet potato whereas the fillings are made from precooked ingredients such as mung bean or ground peanuts and sugar. After kneading and molding the ingredients together, the red tortoise cakes are steamed on a piece of banana leaf. In countries such as Singapore and Malaysia, these pastries are popular snack items and are especially popular with children because of their sweet and savory taste. In fact, many bakeries in Singapore have created red tortoise cakes in a variety of assorted flavors, including jelly and red bean, to cater to all tastes and preferences.\nIn Chinese culture, the color red is traditionally used as a symbol of joy and happiness whereas the tortoise symbolizes longevity, power and tenacity.\nAs such, red tortoise cakes are of a high cultural significance and value amongst the Chinese people. They are typically associated with auspicious occasions and are especially prepared during birthdays and religious festivals to symbolize blessings and good fortune.\nChinese New Year is the most important festival in Chinese culture as it represents the start of a new year for everyone where people could reconcile and welcome the new year in hope for peace and prosperity. During this festival, the Chinese people would pray for good fortune and sweets such as rice cakes and red tortoise cakes are offered to the Chinese deities on ritual altars. These ritual offerings are made in the hope that the sweetness from these cakes will leave a sweet taste in the mouths of the deities and they will bless the people with a prosperous year ahead.\nThe Jade Emperor is one of the most important gods in Chinese folklore. He is believed to be the ruler of heaven and his birthday falls on the ninth day of the first lunar month.   To celebrate his birthday, the Chinese people will conduct prayers in his name and prepare food within Chinese temples or Chinese households as ritual offerings. In Chinese culture, red tortoise cakes are considered must-haves amongst the food items that are to be offered to the Jade Emperor on altar tables.\nBecause the number 6 is considered an auspicious number in Chinese culture, red tortoise cakes are placed on the altar table in multiples of six such as 12, 24 or 36 in the hope that he will bless the people with good fortune and prosperity.\nQing Ming Festival is the time for the Chinese to visit the burial grounds of their ancestors to pay their respects. Prayers are conducted to honor the ancestors and food items such as red tortoise cakes are prepared as offerings. However, there is some difference in the red tortoise cakes that are prepared for this occasion. Apart from the usual red tortoise cakes that are prepared in the color red, there are separate red tortoise cakes that are prepared in the colors green or white. The reason for these differences in color between red tortoise cakes is that these colors are of cultural significance to the Chinese people. The color red is representative of the virtuous life led by the ancestors whereas the",

White pudding, oatmeal pudding or (in Scotland) mealy pudding is a meat dish popular in Scotland, Ireland, Northumberland, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. \nWhite pudding is broadly similar to black pudding, but does not include blood. Modern recipes consist of suet or fat, oatmeal or barley, breadcrumbs and in some cases pork and pork liver, filled into a natural or cellulose sausage casing. Recipes in previous centuries included a wider range of ingredients.\nWhite pudding is often thought of as a very old dish that, like black pudding, was a traditional way of making use of offal following the annual slaughter of livestock. Whereas black pudding-type recipes appear in Roman sources, white pudding likely has specifically medieval origins, possibly as a culinary descendant of medieval sweetened blancmange-type recipes combining shredded chicken, rice and almonds, or as a way of lightening up offal with the addition of cream, eggs and breadcrumbs. Meatless versions were common, as they could be eaten during the Lenten period of abstinence. Many older recipes are sweetened: a 15th century British pudding combined pork liver, cream, eggs, breadcrumbs, raisins and dates, while a 1588 recipe collection featured a white pudding made of beef suet, breadcrumbs, egg yolk and currants, flavoured with nutmeg, sugar and cinnamon. A similar recipe given in Woolley's 1670 book The Queen-Like Closet used hog's lights and was filled into intestine sausage-skins. By the mid-18th century, Elizabeth Raffald's white pudding recipe, \"White Puddings in Skins\", combined rice, lard, ground almonds, currants and egg, using sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and mace as flavourings; by this period the inclusion of offal such as liver or lights, as well as sweet flavourings, was becoming rarer.\nAn oatmeal pudding recipe found in the 18th century Compleat Housewife is made with beef suet and cream, thickened with oatmeal and mixed up with egg yolks, then baked in a dish with marrow.\nAlongside these more refined and elaborate recipes, a simpler form of white pudding was popular in Ireland, Scotland, and some parts of Northern England, combining suet, oatmeal (or barley in Northumberland), seasoning and onions, in sheep's or cow's intestines.  In Gaelic speaking parts of Scotland and Ireland they were referred to by the names marag gheal or put\u00f3g bh\u00e1n. These oatmeal-based puddings survived into modern Irish and Scottish cuisine, although with significant regional differences. Modern commercially made Scottish white puddings are generally based on oatmeal, onions, and beef suet; the same mixture simply fried in a pan is known as skirlie. In Ireland, white puddings also include a substantial proportion of pork or pork liver and pork fat. Most modern white puddings are filled into a synthetic cellulose casing and boiled or steamed; typical spices used include white pepper, nutmeg, and sage.\nWhite puddings were once also associated with south-western England: Taylor, in the 17th century, mentions \"the white puddings of Somersetshire\". Hog's pudding, still made in Somerset, Cornwall and Devon, is very similar to other white puddings although is somewhat more highly spiced.\nAnother Scottish variant, fruit pudding, includes dried fruit in addition to beef suet and oatmeal.\nBoudin\nGoetta\nHaggis\nRed pudding\nScrapple\nList of Irish dishes\nSee, for instance, James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man: \"White pudding and eggs and sausages and cups of tea!

Boerewors, ([\u02c8bu\u02d0r\u0259\u02ccv\u0254rs]) a type of sausage which originated in South Africa. It is an important part of South African,  Zimbabwean and Namibian cuisine and is popular across Southern Africa. The name is derived from the Afrikaans words boer (\"farmer\") and wors (\"sausage\"). According to South African government regulation boerewors must contain at least 90 percent meat, and always contain beef, as well as lamb, pork, or a mixture of lamb and pork. The other 10% is made up of spices and other ingredients. Not more than 30% of the meat content may be fat. Boerewors may not contain offal or any \"mechanically recovered\" meat pulp (as recovered through a process where meat and bone are mechanically separated).\nBoerewors is made from coarsely minced beef (sometimes combined with minced pork, lamb, or both) and spices (usually toasted coriander seed, black pepper, nutmeg, cloves and allspice). Like many other forms of sausage, boerewors contains a high proportion of fat, and is preserved with salt and vinegar, and packed in sausage casings. Traditional boerewors is usually formed into a continuous spiral. It is often served with pap (traditional South African porridge / polenta made from mielie-meal). Boerewors is also very common throughout Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe as well as with expatriate South African communities worldwide.\nOn 3 May 2014, the Guinness World Record for braaing the longest boerewors in the world was broken in South Africa. It measured 1,557.15\u00a0m (5,108\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) in length. The boerewors was distributed freely to old-age homes and the Abraham Kriel Orphanage.\nThe many varieties of boerewors include specialties such as garlic wors, kameeldoring (camel thorn), Karoowors (sausage from the Karoo region in South Africa), and spekwors (made with extra cubed pork fat). Other ingredients include cheese and chilli peppers.\nA similar sausage may also be made from the meat of different animal species, such as kudu, and springbok, but it may not be sold as boerewors. Instead, it is named after the predominant meat species, but only if it contains at least 75% meat from that specific species.  When a sausage is made from different types of game, it may not be labelled boerewors but must be labelled as sausage and with the names of all the game species in it.\nBoerewors does not keep well unrefrigerated. A similar dried or cured sausage called dro\u00ebwors is prepared instead in a process similar to the preparation of biltong. Dro\u00ebwors has become popular in its own right as a snack.\nIn response to the modern plant-based food movement, various vegan boerewors variants, mostly made by small and home-based industries, have begun to appear in retailers and food markets in South Africa.\nThe preparation and grilling of boerewors has become a fine art with many local, regional and national competitions taking place. The Shoprite supermarket chain hosts an annual competition to determine the best new preparations. The winner of this competition has the privilege of having their product/recipe manufactured and sold in all Checkers stores nationwide, under the Championship Boerewors brand.\nSouth African cuisine\n\"Boerewors, n.\".

Khoa is made by simmering full-fat milk in a large, shallow iron pan for several hours over a medium fire. The gradual evaporation of its water content leaves only the milk solids. The ideal temperature to avoid scorching is about 80C (180F). Another quick way of making khoa is to add full fat milk powder to skimmed milk and mixing and heating until it becomes thick.

Khoa, khoya, khuwa or mawa is a dairy food, originating from the Indian subcontinent, widely used in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, encompassing India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is made of either dried whole milk or milk thickened by heating in an open iron pan. It is lower in moisture than typical fresh cheeses such as ricotta.\nKhoya is classified into different types, based on moisture content. Different types of khoya are used for different preparations.\nBatti, meaning \"rock\", has 20% moisture by weight and is the hardest of the three types; it can be grated like cheese. It can be aged for up to a year, during which it develops a unique aroma and a mouldy outer surface.\nChikna (\"slippery\" or \"squishy\") khoya has 50% moisture.\nDaanedaar is a grainy variety. The milk is coagulated with an acid during the simmering; it has a moderate moisture content. It is used for preparing kalakand, gourd barfi and other sweets.\nPindi, dry khoya, is used for preparing barfi and peda.\nDhap, a less dried version, is used for preparing gulab jamun and pantua.\nKhoa is used in various types of sweets: \nPedha  is sweetened khoa formed into balls or thick disks (like patties) with flavourings such as saffron and/or cardamom added.\nGulab jamun, also a round ball sweet made from khoa and then deep fried and soaked in rose water flavoured sugar or honey syrup. A very popular Indian sweet.\nBarfi (or burfi) is also flavoured, but khoa is not the only ingredient. Typically, another ingredient, such as thickened fruit pulp or coconut shavings, is added to khoya and slow cooked until the moisture evaporates sufficiently to give the consistency of fudge, so it can be flattened and cut into rectangles, parallelograms or diamond shapes.\nGujia, a sweet dumpling stuffed with khoa.\nHalwa is essentially a fudge made by adding khoa to wheat starch or cornstarch and sugar syrup to give a dairy-like taste and texture and as a thickening agent. Most halva recipes, however may omit the khoa, relying only on starch and sugar plus slivered nuts, spices such as cardamom and/ or saffron, and flavorings such as rose water and screwpine.\nMain course north India dishes like khoya paneer, Makhmali Kofte, Khoya Matar.\nNaan Roti stuffed with Khoya/Khawa is a speciality of the Muslim bakers of Bangalore.\nCream Bell Ice Creams of India sells an Ice Cream brand called Royal Rajwadi that contains thick layers of cold pressed Mawa covered thin layer of Indian Kulfi Ice Cream\nHomemade Instant Khoya with milkpowder\nChhena\u00a0\u2013 Type of cheese curds originating in India\nList of water buffalo cheeses\u00a0\u2013 Wikipedia list article\nindiacurry.com Fuzzy Math for reducing milk Archived 2007-10-12 at the Wayback Machine Retrieved 2008-02-24.\nindiacurry.com Making khoya mawa Recipe Archived 2007-10-12 at the Wayback Machine Retrieved 2008-02-24.\nSN Mahindru (2009).

Monkey bread (also known by other names including plucking cake, pull-apart bread, and bubble bread) is a soft, sweet, sticky pastry served in the United States for breakfast or as a treat. It consists of pieces of soft baked dough sprinkled with cinnamon.

Dating back to the 1880s in Hungarian literature, Hungarian immigrants brought this dish with them when they immigrated to America and began introducing it into the country's food landscape when Hungarian and Hungarian Jewish bakeries began selling it in the mid-twentieth century.\nIn 1972, a cookbook published by Betty Crocker included a recipe for arany galuska, which they referred to as \"Hungarian Coffee Cake\". As it became more popular in America, arany galuska came to be confused with monkey bread in which the balls of dough are not dipped in cinnamon and sugar but only in butter. \"Monkey bread\" soon became the more common name for this Hungarian Jewish dessert.\nRecipes for the bread first appeared in American women's magazines and community cookbooks in the 1950s, but the dish is still virtually unknown outside the United States. \nDuring the 1980s, Nancy Reagan popularized serving monkey bread during Christmas by making it a staple of the Reagan White House Christmas.\nArany galuska\nList of buns\nList of pastries\n\"Monkey bread recipe\". taste.com.au. 7 July 2015.\nOlver, Lynne. \"The Food Timeline: history notes\".

A Mont Blanc (or Mont-Blanc aux marrons, in Italian, Monte Bianco) is a dessert of sweetened chestnut pur\u00e9e in the form of vermicelli, topped with whipped cream. It was created in nineteenth-century Piedmont, in Italy. The name comes from Mont Blanc, as the dish resembles a snow-capped mountain.\nMont Blanc has been an autumn and winter favorite at many Parisian p\u00e2tisseries, notably the Parisian tea shop Angelina, where it has been a specialty since it opened in 1903. For a long time considered old-fashioned and heavy, it has become newly popular in the 2010s in a lighter form at trendy shops like Pierre Herm\u00e9, with many variations.\nMont Blanc is popular in France, Italy, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Japan, Slovakia, Switzerland, Hungary, and northwestern Romania.\nChestnut pur\u00e9es have a long history as a soup, porridge, or side dish for meats, especially in regions where chestnuts are a staple food. However, these dishes are not desserts, and are not served with whipped cream. Even a Swiss or German recipe of whole chestnuts cooked with cream and butter and seasoned with cinnamon is treated as a savory dish in 1844.\nThe Mont Blanc has three distinctive characteristics: it is sweet, it is made of chestnut pur\u00e9e in the form of vermicelli served as a mount or a ring, and it is heaped with whipped cream.\nA sweet dessert of pur\u00e9ed chestnuts passed through a sieve to make vermicelli shapes\u2014but without the characteristic whipped cream of the Mont Blanc\u2014is called in various French cookbooks starting in 1842 (compote de) marrons en vermicelle.\nA dish called entremets du Mont-Blanc or simply montblanc, described as a sweet combination of chestnuts and cream, is said to have been invented by the Dessat(s) pastry-shop by 1847. Sources do not specify exactly how it was prepared, but it was said to be \"a true monument which will make his name immortal, that is, a dish that all mouths will praise\".\nAn unambiguous reference to the Mont Blanc is a dish of pur\u00e9ed chestnuts topped with whipped cream documented in 1885, called torche aux marrons, and considered an Alsatian dish. That recipe does not specify that the chestnuts are formed into vermicelli, but an 1892 article does, and clearly says that torche is the Alsatian name for what is called Mont Blanc in southern France. The same dish is also called marrons chantilly in 1889.\nThe dish with whipped cream and the name Mont-Blanc aux marrons appears in 1888, 1889, and 1893, and then in Escoffier's Guide Culinaire in 1903, with the advice to pile the whipped cream up irregularly to imitate a rugged mountain.\nAccording to the Mont-Blanc (Monburan) pastry shop in Tokyo, Mont Blanc was introduced to Japan in 1933, inspired by the Mont Blanc of Angelina in Paris. That shop used chestnuts preserved in syrup, which were yellow.\nIt has been claimed that the dessert was described in Platina's De Honesta Voluptate in 1475, and that a recipe is found in Scappi's Opera in 1570, but no such recipe appears in these writings. It is also claimed that it arrived in France from Italy in 1620, but no evidence is given for this.\nThe chestnut pur\u00e9e may be formed in a mold rather than into vermicelli shapes, though this tends to make the dish heavier. This may be what was called \"timbale de marrons, Chantilly\" on an 1868 menu.\nThe original version served multiple diners, but the p\u00e2tisserie version today is often an individual serving.\nIn France, it is sometimes presented on a meringue or biscuit bottom. It may be flavored or garnished with chocolate, rose syrup, berries, and so on.\nVariations include using chestnuts in the meringue or biscuit base, with no pur\u00e9e.\nEscoffier also describes a Mont-Blanc aux fraises, essentially whipped cream studded with fraises des bois, with no chestnuts at all, the name referring to its shape.\nA simplified version mixes cr\u00e8me de marrons with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and serves it in a bowl, with no \"mountain\".\nTraditional patisseries in Shanghai often have chestnut vermicelli cut into short bits, and laid atop a base of sponge cake, the thickness of which may vary. Shanghainese chestnut Mont Blanc also feature a heavy unwhipped cream topping and may be served in cups. Such style is said to have been created by a German pastry chef at the city\u2019s first European patisserie, Kaisiling, and over time it has become a Shanghainese staple under the unassuming name \u201cli zi dan gao\u201d or chestnut cake. \nIn Japan, sometimes pumpkin, squash, and purple yam are used instead of chestnuts, and along with chestnuts, sometimes cocoa or matcha are added. There are also fruit Mont Blanc, with flavors such as mango and strawberry. In fact, all they have in common with the original is being made of a pur\u00e9e formed into vermicelli shapes.\nMarron glac\u00e9\nList of desserts\nLucile Escourrou, \"Le Mont Blanc\u00a0: ce grand",

It is then immersed in egg batter or buttermilk, then dredged in flour to which salt, pepper, and often other seasonings have been added. Chicken-fried steak is typically deep-fried and served with cream gravy, while country fried steak is typically fried in a skillet and served with brown gravy. The frying medium has traditionally been shortening, but butter and lard have sometimes been used instead. Health concerns have led many cooks to replace the shortening with vegetable oil. ...",

Chicken-fried steak, also known as country-fried steak or CFS, is an American breaded cutlet dish consisting of a piece of beefsteak (most often tenderized cube steak) coated with seasoned flour and either deep-fried or pan-fried. It is sometimes associated with the Southern cuisine of the United States. It is breaded and fried with a technique similar to the more common fried chicken, hence \"chicken-fried\". When deep-fried, it is usually referred to as \"chicken-fried steak\". Pan-fried versions are typically referred to as \"country fried steak\".\nChicken-fried steak resembles the Austrian dish Wiener schnitzel and the Italian dish cotoletta alla milanese, which is a tenderized veal or pork cutlet, coated with flour, eggs, chicken stock cube, and bread crumbs, and then fried. It is also similar to the recipe for Scottish collops.\nThe precise origins of the dish are unclear, but many sources attribute its development to German and Austrian immigrants to Texas in the 19th century, who brought recipes for Wiener schnitzel from Europe to the USA. Lamesa, the seat of Dawson County on the Texas South Plains, claims to be the birthplace of chicken-fried steak, and hosts an annual celebration accordingly.\nThe Virginia Housewife, published in 1838 by Mary Randolph, has a recipe for veal cutlets that is one of the earliest recipes for a food like chicken-fried steak. The recipe for what we now know as chicken-fried steak was included in many regional cookbooks by the late 19th century. The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest attestation of the term \"chicken-fried steak\" is from a restaurant advertisement in the 19 June 1914 edition of the Colorado Springs Gazette newspaper.\nA 1943 American cookbook recipe for Wiener schnitzel includes a white salt and pepper cream gravy.\nChicken-fried steak is among numerous popular dishes which make up the official state meal of Oklahoma, added to the list in 1988.\nTypically, in Texas and surrounding states, chicken fried steak is either deep fried or fried in a thick layer of oil in a pan and served with traditional peppered milk gravy.\nRegionally, when pan-fried it may be referred to as \"country fried steak\". While some recipes and restaurants will use a traditional peppered milk gravy on country fried steak, a variant using a brown, beef stock-based gravy with onions is common and is the primary difference between the two dishes in regions where both are served.\nChicken fried bacon\nCity chicken\nCotoletta\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nParmo\nParmigiana\nSchnitzel\nTonkatsu\nWeaver, Bobby. \"Chicken-Fried Steak\".

After this initial preparation, they are fried in hot oil until they are golden brown. In Zaragoza, spicy tomato-based sauce, mayonnaise and garlic will be added. The bread is usually sliced on one side. Traditionally, it was served with bread full of fried breadcrumbs. Recently, baguettes from the establishment are usually made from previously frozen dough, which is usually cut on one side, giving each place a characteristic touch.",

Squid sandwich or bocadillo de calamares in Spanish, is a culinary specialty very common in Spain consisting of squid battered in flour and fried in oil that is usually olive, or the more sophisticated version that is all of the above plus a spicy tomato sauce and mayonnaise with garlic similar to that of patatas bravas. It is usually served hot and freshly made. This type of sandwich (specifically the original version without sauce) is very popular in Madrid and can be found in most of the bars of the Spanish capital, particularly in the Plaza Mayor as well as the Calle de Botoneras at the southeast corner of Plaza Mayor. In Zaragoza, the sophisticated version of the calamari sandwich is traditional, with the spicy sauce (tomato, mayonnaise and garlic), and it is called bocadillo de calamares bravos or spicy squid sandwich, which is served in the bars on Calle Cinco de Marzo.\nSometimes a bit of squeezed lemon is added to the fried squid dish for flavor, and mayonnaise is also common. It is usually accompanied with a very cold beer. The squids are usually served in a bread that is opened only on one side and is filled with fried breadcrumbs.\nThe bocadillo de rabas or \"fried squid ring sandwich\" is very popular in northern Spain, where fresh squid can be found on the coast. The way of preparation is similar to the Madrid version and they can be found in various bars and restaurants in Cantabria, as well as in the Basque Country. In Madrid, there are even \"Rutas del Bocadillo de Calamares\" (Routes of Squid Sandwiches) that allow you to discover variants of the sandwich.\nSquid as food\nN\u00e9stor Luj\u00e1n, (1994), \"Como pi\u00f1ones mondados, Cuento de Cuentos de Gastronom\u00eda\",Ed.

A deep-fried Oreo is a dessert or snack consisting of a chocolate sandwich cookie which is dipped in batter and deep fried. It may be served with different toppings, most commonly powdered sugar. Deep-fried Oreos are generally made using Oreo-brand cookies, hence the name, but other chocolate sandwich cookies can be used.\nControversy abounds as to who first invented deep-fried Oreos. Skylar R. claims to have fried them first for his best fried who has never had them before. From there, they showed up at the Iowa State Fair in 2002. Deep-fried Oreos were later introduced independently in 2004 by Delia, also known as \"Chicken girl\" or \"The Girl Who Fries Everything,\" a 16-year-old Armenian settled in the United States, at the L.A. County Fair. Delia dipped Oreos in pancake batter, deep fried them, drizzled them with chocolate syrup and served them with powdered sugar. \"There are many other fried foods at the fair, but I specialize in it. I make it my life,\" Delia said about deep-fried food. Aside from the deep-fried Oreo, she has also introduced new types of deep-fried food every year in different state fairs.\nSince the debut of the deep-fried Oreo, it has now become very common at carnivals and is a \"cult favorite.\"\nNumerous variations of deep-fried Oreos have been derived from the typical recipe since its debut, including bacon deep-fried Oreos (deep-fried Oreos which are wrapped in slices of bacon); deep-fried Oreo ice cream, in which ice cream covered with egg mixture and crushed Oreo cookies is deep fried; and deep-fried Oreo burgers, which take the form of a deep-fried Oreo within a burger (including the patty) alongside other fillings, such as bacon.\nIn 2013, the deep-fried Oreo won the Annual Big Tex Choice in the State Fair of Texas.\nDeep-fried Oreos were also introduced on TV shows and viral videos by some celebrities. In 2012, a popular Taiwanese variety show by the name of Kangsi Coming also publicized the deep-fried Oreo. In the programme, an American talked about deep-fried Oreos, referring to it as one of the most popular foods in Taiwanese night markets.\nIn 2013, on The Jay Leno Show, Kim Kardashian cooked deep-fried Oreos with Guy Fieri and said about it: \"It's like a once-a-year snack.\"\nYuka Kinoshita, a famous Japanese competitive eater, filmed a YouTube video of herself eating over 30 deep-fried Oreos in 2016. The video has exceeded 3 million views.\nThe deep-fried Oreo has become worldwide since its debut in 2002 at the Los Angeles County Fair and Texas State Fair. Outside of its birthplace, the United States, the deep-fried Oreo has been available in different countries all over the world, including Australia, Canada, Dubai, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.\nDeep-fried foods have been criticized for being linked to various health problems, since they are usually high in calories, fat (including saturated fat), and cholesterol. For instance, the saturated fat and trans fat in deep-fried foods increase the risk of high cholesterol, heart disease, cancer and obesity. As such, deep-fried Oreos have aroused health controversies. Five deep-fried Oreos contain 900 calories and have a total of 51 grams of sugar, 950\u00a0mg of sodium, and 48 grams of fat.\nDeep-fried Oreos are included in a junk food encyclopedia titled Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of What We Love to Eat by Andrew F.

Knafeh (Arabic: \u0643\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0629\u200e) is a traditional Middle Eastern dessert made with spun pastry called kataifi, soaked in sweet, sugar-based syrup, and typically layered with cheese, or with other ingredients such as clotted cream, pistachio or nuts, depending on the region. It is popular in the Arab world, particularly Egypt and the Levant, being considered the most representative and iconic Palestinian dessert. Variants are also found in Turkey, Greece, and the Balkans.\nIn Arabic, the name may refer to the string pastry itself, or to the entire dessert dish. In Turkish, the string pastry is known as tel kaday\u0131f, and the cheese-based dessert that uses it as k\u00fcnefe. In the Balkans, the shredded dough is similarly known as kadaif, and in Greece as kataifi, and is the basis of various dishes rolled or layered with it, including dessert pastries with nuts and sweet syrups.\nOne of the most well-known preparations of the dessert is \"Knafeh Nabulsiyeh\", which originated in the city of Nablus, and is the most representative and iconic Palestinian dessert. Knafeh Nabulsiyeh uses a white-brine cheese called Nabulsi. It is prepared in a large round shallow dish, the pastry is colored with orange food coloring, and sometimes topped with crushed pistachio nuts.\nThe English language borrows the word from Levantine and Egyptian Arabic, and widely transliterates it as kanafeh, kenafeh, knafeh, kunafah, kunafeh, konafa, kunafa, and similar variations. Its form in Arabic, \u0643\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0629, renders as kn\u0101fa when transliterated.\nThe ultimate origin of kanafeh is debated. Some sources state that it comes from the Coptic Egyptian word kenephiten, meaning a bread or cake. Early attestations are found in Egyptian stories in Alf layla\u1e97 wa-layla\u1e97, the One Thousand and One Nights. Another view is that it comes from a Semitic root with a meaning of \"side\" or \"wing\", from the Arabic kanafa, \"to flank or enclose\".\nAccording to etymologist Sevan Ni\u015fanyan, the Turkish term tel kaday\u0131f\u0131 (\"string-pancake\" or \"string-cr\u00eape\"), referring to the vermicelli-like pastry often used in kanafeh and other dishes, is based on the Arabic word qatayif (a pancake or cr\u00eape). It appears in 1501 in a Turkish-Persian dictionary.\nA common story is that the dish was created, and prescribed by doctors, to satisfy the hunger of caliphs during Ramadan. The story is variously said to have happened in Fatimid Egypt, or in the Umayyad Caliphate in Syria. It is also reported to have been mentioned in writing as early as the 10th century, and to be of Fatimid origin. However, dishes mentioned in historical texts are not necessarily the same as the modern versions of kanafeh.\nIbn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th century Kitab al-Tabikh (Book of Dishes), a collection of Arabic and Persian recipes and food advice of the Abbasid caliphs, mentions neither the word kun\u0101fa, nor a description of the dish as it is known today. However, it does feature a chapter on desserts made with the related qat\u0101yif, meaning cr\u00eapes, from which the Turkish word kaday\u0131f and Greek word kata\u00effi derive. In one recipe, qat\u0101yif are stuffed with nuts, deep-fried, and topped with honey-sugar syrup, which is essentially unchanged in today's version. Also described are large thin cr\u00eapes resembling fabric, called ruq\u0101q, cooked on a round sheet of metal called a t\u0101baq, layered with fruit, and drenched with sugar.\nThe 13th century anonymous Kitab al tabikh fi-l-Maghrib wa-l-Andalus (Book of Dishes from Mahgreb and Al-Andalus) uses the word 'kun\u0101fa' to describe a cr\u00eape made with thin batter on an Indian pan or \"mirror\" (the t\u0101baq), and says it is equivalent to ruq\u0101q. It also gives a recipe for Abbasid Qat\u0101yif (the cr\u00eapes being called musahhada in Al-Andalus), which uses the same batter, but the kun\u0101fa is made thinner, \"like a fine tissue\". It gives a number of dessert recipes for kun\u0101fa, where the cr\u00eapes are served layered with fresh cheese, baked, and topped with honey and rose syrup; or cut up into shreds like rose leaves and cooked with honey, nuts, sugar, and rosewater.\nIbn al-Jazari gives an account of a 13th-century market inspector who rode through Damascus at night, ensuring the quality of kun\u0101fa, qat\u0101'if, and other foods associated with Ramadan, during the Mamluk period.\nIn the later Middle Ages, a new technique was created, with thin batter being dripped onto the metal sheet from a perforated container, creating hair-like strings. A mid-15th century Ottoman Turkish translation of Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi's Kitab al-Tabikh added several new contemporary recipes, including one for this kadayif, though it does not specify where it originated.

Faloodeh (Persian: \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062f\u0647\u200e, romanized:\u00a0f\u0101l\u016bde) or paloodeh (Persian: \u067e\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062f\u0647\u200e, romanized:\u00a0p\u0101l\u016bde) is a traditional Iranian cold dessert similar to a sorbet. It consists of thin vermicelli-sized noodles made from starch in a semi-frozen syrup containing sugar and rose water. Faloodeh is often served with lime juice and sometimes ground pistachios. \nIn Iran, faloodeh is sold in ice cream stores and coffee shops in flavors such as pistachio, saffron, rosewater and honey, and can be served alongside bastani sonnati, a traditional Persian ice cream. Faloodeh Shirazi (Persian: \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0632\u06cc\u200e, romanized:\u00a0f\u0101l\u016bde Shir\u0101zi), the version from the city of Shiraz, is particularly well-known.\nThe Persian word paloodeh is from the verb paloodan (Persian: \u067e\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062f\u0646\u200e) which means to refine. Faloodeh is an Arabicized form of paloodeh that appeared after the Arab conquest of Iran, due to a lack of the phoneme /p/ in Standard Arabic. In Arab medieval sources, it was known as Faloothaj (Arabic: \u0641\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0630\u064e\u062c\u200e, romanized:\u00a0F\u0101l\u016b\u1e0fa\u01e7) for example in Al-Mu\u1e25kam wa-al-mu\u1e25\u012bt al-a\u02bb\u1e93am.\nIn the 16th to 18th centuries, the Indo-Persian Mughal kings who ruled South Asia created a cold dessert beverage called falooda, which is a derivative of faloodeh.\n\u00a0Food portal\n\u00a0Iran portal\nDan Jurafsky (November 16, 2011). \"Macarons, Macaroons, Macaroni: The curious history\".

Other names found in medieval texts are \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (gardo\u00famion) and \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (gardo\u00famenon), from which \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1 (gardo\u00fampa) and \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 (gardoump\u00e1kia) derive, as alternative names for a smaller version of kokoretsi in Greece. \u03a4he Medieval Greek \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (gardo\u00famion) in turn derives from Latin caldumen; from caldus or calidus 'warm, hot'.\nAccording to Greek linguist and philologist Georgios Babiniotis, the Greek word \u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9 (kokor\u00e9tsi) comes from Albanian kukurec. According to Turkish-Armenian linguist Sevan Ni\u015fanyan, Albanian kukurec is a loanword derived from Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian kukuruza, originally meaning corncob in these languages. Ni\u015fanyan also asserts that the Greek word is not derived from the Albanian kukurec, but both words are cognates that were loaned from South Slavic languages independently.\nThe Turkish word kokore\u00e7 was first attested in Lokanta Esrar\u0131; a short story written in 1920 by the Turkish author \u00d6mer Seyfettin. The author writes that the first time he heard of kokore\u00e7, was when it was presented to him as a specialty of an Athenian who worked in an Istanbul restaurant; it was described as a Greek dish made from small intestines. The Turkish word derives from the Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9 (kokor\u00e9tsi).\nThe cooked kokoretsi is chopped or sliced, sprinkled with oregano, and served on a plate. Sometimes it is served on a piece of flatbread. Some add tomatoes or spices in it. It may also (especially in Turkey) be served in half a baguette or in a sandwich bun, plain or garnished, almost always with oregano and red pepper. In Turkey, common side dishes are pickled peppers or cucumbers. It is often seasoned with lemon, oregano, salt, a pepper, and typically accompanied by wine or raki.\n\nThe Byzantines treated the small intestines of sheep and goats the same way as modern Greeks do when making kokoretsi. Through a simple process, the intestines were inverted with the help of a small stick in order to be cleaned. They were then wrapped in braids, in the appropriate shape, or around other entrails on a skewer.\nIn modern times, kokoretsi is traditionally served for Orthodox Easter celebrations; eaten as an appetizer while the lamb (being the main dish) is roasting. It is also served year-round. Gardouba (\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1) or gardoubakia (\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1) is a smaller version of kokoretsi; it may be grilled like kokoretsi, roasted in a pan, or cooked in the oven.\nDue to outbreak of mad cow disease in the late '90s, banning the consumption of offal was considered. However, the idea was abandoned.\nKokoretsi is one of the most consumed fast foods in Turkey, being described as \"the signature delight\" of the country. Although it is also served in some restaurants, most of the kokoretsi is prepared, cooked and sold in small kiosks year-round, and is usually consumed as a sandwich after having alcohol. Kokoretsi makers are called kokore\u00e7\u00e7i in Turkish.\nIn the early 2000s, during the Turkish accession to the European Union it has been speculated by the Turkish media that EU regulations regarding sheep's offal would eventually lead to a ban on kokoretsi, if Turkey ever become a member state.\nList of goat dishes\nList of lamb dishes\nTorcinello, a similar southern Italian dish\nZarajos, a similar dish from Manchego cuisine, especially in the Cuenca area.\nKoukoules, Phaidon I.

They called it \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03bd (plekt\u00edn), \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc\u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1 (koili\u00f3chorda), or \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1 (chord\u00f3koila); the latter two are preserved with the meaning of wrapped intestines in the Greek idioms of Corfu as \u03c4\u03c3\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1 (tsoil\u00edchourda), of Plovdiv as \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1 (chord\u00f3koila), of Chios as \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1 (soil\u00edgourda), of Pontians as \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1 (chord\u00f3gkoila), and in part, of Zagori and Argyrades as \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03ae (chord\u00ed), of Thessaly as \u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b4\u03ae (chourd\u00ed), of northern Peloponnese as \u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac (kordi\u00e1) or \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1 (k\u00f3rda), and of Vogatsiko as \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b4\u03af (kourd\u00ed).

According to Turkish-Armenian linguist Sevan Ni\u015fanyan, Albanian kukurec is a loanword derived from Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian kukuruza, originally meaning corncob in these languages. Ni\u015fanyan also asserts that the Greek word is not derived from the Albanian kukurec, but both words are cognates that were loaned from South Slavic languages independently.\nThe Turkish word kokore\u00e7 was first attested in Lokanta Esrar\u0131; a short story written in 1920 by the Turkish author \u00d6mer Seyfettin. The author writes that the first time he heard of kokore\u00e7, was when it was presented to him as a specialty of an Athenian who worked in an Istanbul restaurant; it was described as a Greek dish made from small intestines. The Turkish word derives from the Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9 (kokor\u00e9tsi).\nThe cooked kokoretsi is chopped or sliced, sprinkled with oregano, and served on a plate. Sometimes it is served on a piece of flatbread. Some add tomatoes or spices in it. It may also (especially in Turkey) be served in half a baguette or in a sandwich bun, plain or garnished, almost always with oregano and red pepper. In Turkey, common side dishes are pickled peppers or cucumbers. It is often seasoned with lemon, oregano, salt, a pepper, and typically accompanied by wine or raki.\n\nThe Byzantines treated the small intestines of sheep and goats the same way as modern Greeks do when making kokoretsi. Through a simple process, the intestines were inverted with the help of a small stick in order to be cleaned. They were then wrapped in braids, in the appropriate shape, or around other entrails on a skewer.\nIn modern times, kokoretsi is traditionally served for Orthodox Easter celebrations; eaten as an appetizer while the lamb (being the main dish) is roasting. It is also served year-round. Gardouba (\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1) or gardoubakia (\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1) is a smaller version of kokoretsi; it may be grilled like kokoretsi, roasted in a pan, or cooked in the oven.\nDue to outbreak of mad cow disease in the late '90s, banning the consumption of offal was considered. However, the idea was abandoned.\nKokoretsi is one of the most consumed fast foods in Turkey, being described as \"the signature delight\" of the country. Although it is also served in some restaurants, most of the kokoretsi is prepared, cooked and sold in small kiosks year-round, and is usually consumed as a sandwich after having alcohol. Kokoretsi makers are called kokore\u00e7\u00e7i in Turkish.\nIn the early 2000s, during the Turkish accession to the European Union it has been speculated by the Turkish media that EU regulations regarding sheep's offal would eventually lead to a ban on kokoretsi, if Turkey ever become a member state.\nList of goat dishes\nList of lamb dishes\nTorcinello, a similar southern Italian dish\nZarajos, a similar dish from Manchego cuisine, especially in the Cuenca area.\nKoukoules, Phaidon I.

The hard core is chopped into fragments that should be dried perfectly and hand crushed into powder form thereby turning it into flour. This process requires several rounds of pounding. This is then mixed with water to form the product. It can be stored for weeks or a few months.",

Landang, comes from Buli or Buri Tree (Corypha), a type of palm found in the Philippines and other tropical countries. This tree only flowers once in its life and then dies. At first glance, landang looks like shrunken, flattened sago. It is traditionally used in making binignit in the Visayan region of the Philippines.\nLandang is essential in making the traditional Visayan binignit or vegetable stew usually eaten during the Lenten season in the Philippines when almost everyone is fasting.\nThis type of palm is usually found in tropical areas of South Central Asia particularly in India thru the Philippines and some parts of northern Australia. It would grow on different soil types and may reach 20 meters high and would bear up to a million flowers. It is one of the largest palms. It is slow growing and doesn't want to be disturbed once planted. It would require an abundance of sunlight and much water. Like all the Corypha family, it only flowers once during maturity and dies after.\nCabello, Nathan (31 March 2015). \"Cebuano Binignit\". The Freeman.

                "description": "Tchaka is relatively simple to make. However, it often requires several hours of preparation to allow flavors to develop and incorporate throughout the soup. Unlike other soups where the ingredients are prepared in the same pot, for tchaka, the ingredients are usually cooked separately before being combined. This is because the different ingredients have different cooking times. The red beans and corn are soaked for several hours. The pork is boiled then grilled in oil. Then the beans, corn, and meat are combined and simmered at low heat for about two hours. The tchaka is simmered to the desired consistency which is usually on the thicker side. ...",

Tchaka or Chaka is a Haitian stew made from hominy, beans, pumpkin (joumou), and meat (usually pork). It is used as an offering to the loa in Haitian Vodou. The nutritious soup is also associated with festivities and family time.\nOther names for the dish are tyaka, chaka, or tiaka depending on the region. Typical of Haitian cuisine, this dish has influences of many different cultures.\nThe recipe is usually made with salted and smoked pork which imparts a great deal of flavor. This pork is from where most of the flavor comes. The parts of the pig that are used is traditionally the trotter, bacon, shoulder, palette, or loin.\nVarious beans can be used, including pinto, red kidney, small red, and dark red. Dried corn is used, where it can increase fourfold in volume when boiled in water.\nSeveral other local variations exist which use beef, mutton, or crab instead of pork. Some recipes use coconut milk which provides a creamy consistency. Some recipes use squash, yam, or malanga.\nTchaka is usually served during special occasions because it requires a relatively long time to prepare. For example, it can be served during family gatherings. It can also be served on November 1 for All Saints\u2019 Day, on May 1 for Labor Day to honor Azakah Medeh, the loa of harvest and agriculture. In Haitian Vodou, tchaka was the favorite dish of this loa.\nTchaka was mentioned in a song by Haitian musician, Sydney Guillaume, when he wrote: \n\u201cChofe dife! Nou pral manje tchaka! Chofe dife, brase mayi, pa bliye tisale, Nou pral manje yon bon tchaka. Nou pral voye monte yon bouyon t\u00e8t chaje\u201d (\u201cLight the fire! We will eat tchaka! Light the fire, mix the corn, don\u2019t forget the salted pork, we will eat a delicious tchaka, we will cook an incredible stew\u201d).\nHaitians oftentimes cook tchaka during school vacations since it is protein-rich and thought to help with children\u2019s growth.\nList of soups\nFoundation, A.R.C.

Kokoretsi is a dish of the Balkans and Asia Minor, consisting of lamb or goat intestines wrapped around seasoned offal, including sweetbreads, hearts, lungs, or kidneys, and typically grilled; a variant consists of chopped innards cooked on a griddle. The intestines of suckling lambs are preferred.\nA dish identical to modern kokoretsi is first attested in the cuisine of the Byzantines.

Other names found in medieval texts are \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (gardo\u00famion) and \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (gardo\u00famenon), from which \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1 (gardo\u00fampa) and \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 (gardoump\u00e1kia) derive, as alternative names for a smaller version of kokoretsi in Greece. \u03a4he Medieval Greek \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (gardo\u00famion) in turn derives from Latin caldumen; from caldus or calidus 'warm, hot'.\nAccording to Greek linguist and philologist Georgios Babiniotis, the Greek word \u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9 (kokor\u00e9tsi) comes from Albanian kukurec. According to Turkish-Armenian linguist Sevan Ni\u015fanyan, Albanian kukurec is a loanword derived from Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian kukuruza, originally meaning corncob in these languages. Ni\u015fanyan also asserts that the Greek word is not derived from the Albanian kukurec, but both words are cognates that were loaned from South Slavic languages independently.\nThe Turkish word kokore\u00e7 was first attested in Lokanta Esrar\u0131; a short story written in 1920 by the Turkish author \u00d6mer Seyfettin. The author writes that the first time he heard of kokore\u00e7, was when it was presented to him as a specialty of an Athenian who worked in an Istanbul restaurant; it was described as a Greek dish made from small intestines. The Turkish word derives from the Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9 (kokor\u00e9tsi).\nThe cooked kokoretsi is chopped or sliced, sprinkled with oregano, and served on a plate. Sometimes it is served on a piece of flatbread. Some add tomatoes or spices in it. It may also (especially in Turkey) be served in half a baguette or in a sandwich bun, plain or garnished, almost always with oregano and red pepper. In Turkey, common side dishes are pickled peppers or cucumbers. It is often seasoned with lemon, oregano, salt, a pepper, and typically accompanied by wine or raki.\n\nThe Byzantines treated the small intestines of sheep and goats the same way as modern Greeks do when making kokoretsi. Through a simple process, the intestines were inverted with the help of a small stick in order to be cleaned. They were then wrapped in braids, in the appropriate shape, or around other entrails on a skewer.\nIn modern times, kokoretsi is traditionally served for Orthodox Easter celebrations; eaten as an appetizer while the lamb (being the main dish) is roasting. It is also served year-round. Gardouba (\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1) or gardoubakia (\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1) is a smaller version of kokoretsi; it may be grilled like kokoretsi, roasted in a pan, or cooked in the oven.\nDue to outbreak of mad cow disease in the late '90s, banning the consumption of offal was considered. However, the idea was abandoned.\nKokoretsi is one of the most consumed fast foods in Turkey, being described as \"the signature delight\" of the country. Although it is also served in some restaurants, most of the kokoretsi is prepared, cooked and sold in small kiosks year-round, and is usually consumed as a sandwich after having alcohol. Kokoretsi makers are called kokore\u00e7\u00e7i in Turkish.\nIn the early 2000s, during the Turkish accession to the European Union it has been speculated by the Turkish media that EU regulations regarding sheep's offal would eventually lead to a ban on kokoretsi, if Turkey ever become a member state.\nList of goat dishes\nList of lamb dishes\nTorcinello, a similar southern Italian dish\nZarajos, a similar dish from Manchego cuisine, especially in the Cuenca area.\nKoukoules, Phaidon I.

Pira caldo is a fish soup that is part of the traditional cuisine of Paraguay. The Guarani word Pira means \"fish\".\nThe soup is very high in calorie content and in protein. This has its origins in the circumstances after the Paraguayan War (1864 to 1870). The war made food scarce, so daily meals were limited and had to be calorie and nutrient dense.\nMargarita Miro Ibars, a scholar of Paraguayan culinary anthropology, says \"\u2026 all Guarani groups were major consumers of fish and prepared a fish meal. Fish was the basic food protein, along with game hens similar to those of Spain and abundant game animals\u2026 \"\nTraditionally the fish used for pira caldo are mainly smaller river fish such as the mandi'y and tare'y, from the armored catfish family. Other ingredients include fat, onion, tomatoes, green or red bell peppers, parsley, pepper, spices, and salt.\nAquinas, Josefina Velilla. Tembi'u Paraguay.\nIbars, Margarita Miro.

It is an important part of South African,  Zimbabwean and Namibian cuisine and is popular across Southern Africa. The name is derived from the Afrikaans words boer (\"farmer\") and wors (\"sausage\"). According to South African government regulation boerewors must contain at least 90 percent meat, and always contain beef, as well as lamb, pork, or a mixture of lamb and pork. The other 10% is made up of spices and other ingredients. Not more than 30% of the meat content may be fat. Boerewors may not contain offal or any \"mechanically recovered\" meat pulp (as recovered through a process where meat and bone are mechanically separated).",

Boerewors is made from coarsely minced beef (sometimes combined with minced pork, lamb, or both) and spices (usually toasted coriander seed, black pepper, nutmeg, cloves and allspice). Like many other forms of sausage, boerewors contains a high proportion of fat, and is preserved with salt and vinegar, and packed in sausage casings. Traditional boerewors is usually formed into a continuous spiral. It is often served with pap (traditional South African porridge / polenta made from mielie-meal). Boerewors is also very common throughout Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe as well as with expatriate South African communities worldwide.\nOn 3 May 2014, the Guinness World Record for braaing the longest boerewors in the world was broken in South Africa. It measured 1,557.15\u00a0m (5,108\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) in length. The boerewors was distributed freely to old-age homes and the Abraham Kriel Orphanage.\nBoerewors is most traditionally braaied (grilled over charcoal), but is often cooked under an electric grill, or roasted in an oven, or fried in a pan. When cooking Boerewors, pricking the casing should be avoided at all cost, as doing this will lead to the \"wors\" drying out during preparation.  A local variant of the hot dog is the boerewors roll, or \"boerie\", which is a piece of boerewors in a hot dog bun, often served with a tomato, chili and onion relish. Some people prefer Boerewors stew which can be prepared with mash potatoes or pap.\nThe many varieties of boerewors include specialties such as garlic wors, kameeldoring (camel thorn), Karoowors (sausage from the Karoo region in South Africa), and spekwors (made with extra cubed pork fat). Other ingredients include cheese and chilli peppers.\nA similar sausage may also be made from the meat of different animal species, such as kudu, and springbok, but it may not be sold as boerewors. Instead, it is named after the predominant meat species, but only if it contains at least 75% meat from that specific species.  When a sausage is made from different types of game, it may not be labelled boerewors but must be labelled as sausage and with the names of all the game species in it.\nBoerewors does not keep well unrefrigerated. A similar dried or cured sausage called dro\u00ebwors is prepared instead in a process similar to the preparation of biltong. Dro\u00ebwors has become popular in its own right as a snack.\nIn response to the modern plant-based food movement, various vegan boerewors variants, mostly made by small and home-based industries, have begun to appear in retailers and food markets in South Africa.\nThe preparation and grilling of boerewors has become a fine art with many local, regional and national competitions taking place. The Shoprite supermarket chain hosts an annual competition to determine the best new preparations. The winner of this competition has the privilege of having their product/recipe manufactured and sold in all Checkers stores nationwide, under the Championship Boerewors brand.\nSouth African cuisine\n\"Boerewors, n.\".

Agriculture has ever been fundamental for the economy of Laterza. The first evidence of the use of cereals for the production of bread date back to 5th-century b.C. Spelt and barley were the most used ones, above all for what was called focaccia. After the Roman period, for several centuries, the production of bread was only for the noble people who could manage a bakery. In the district called nowadays \"Fornaci\"  ( Furnaces which, in Italian, stands also for bakeries), an ancient oven for bread has been found. It had been active until 18th century and it belonged to a feudatory.\nIn the 50s, the bakeries were managed by only four women: a baker and three workers. The workers prepared the firewood and took the dough from the houses of the village. The baker cooked it and then the workers brought the baked bread in the houses again.\nPane di Laterza is baked in the wood oven with olive wood with some other natural aromatic products like seeds of apricot and almonds. The size of each piece of bread (called panelle or pan\u00e9dd in local dialect) can amount to one, two and four kg. The crust is brown while the soft part inside the bread is ivory.\nFor 100 grams:\nConsorzio per il Pane di Laterza, Laterza (Taranto)\nLaterza is also a member of the National Association of the Cities of Bread (Associazione nazionale Citt\u00e0 del pane), an Italian organization with the aim of promoting and enhancing the traditional types of bread.\nPane di Altamura\n\"Bread of Laterza durum wheat semolina bread from the territory of Laterza and neighbouring towns\". www.pugliaandculture.com.

Then the pulp is cooked and pured, mixed with sugar in a one-to-one rate, cooked again and then filled hot in jars. This kind of preparation guarantees a long shelf life but, as Vitamin C is not heat-resistant, only traces of it remain in the finished product.

Hagebuttenmark is used as a spread on bread, as sweetener in beverages and as condiment in dessert and pastry. It is for example the filling for Krapfen in Franconia.\nIn the European Union commercially produced Hagebuttenmark has to be declared as \"Hagebuttenkonfit\u00fcre extra\" or \"Konfit\u00fcre einfach\" (fruit preserve onefold). Since the \"Hagebuttenkonfit\u00fcre extra\" with kernels is not edible, there's a special provision that allows declaration of the Hagebuttenmark (without kernels) as \"Konfit\u00fcre extra\".

In most of southern Karnataka/old Mysore it is eaten almost daily. Many luxury hotels serve ragi mudde on special occasions.

                "description": "Churchkhela is a homemade Georgian product. Georgians usually make Churchkhela in Autumn when the primary ingredients, grapes and nuts, are harvested. It is a string of walnut halves that have been dipped in grape juice called Tatara or Phelamushi (grape juice thickened with flour), and dried in the sun. No sugar is added to make real Churchkhela. Instead of walnuts, sometimes hazelnuts or almonds are used in the regions of west Georgia. The shape of Churchkhela looks like a candle. Georgian warriors carried Churchkhelas with them because they contain many calories. The best Churchkhela is made in Kakheti region, which is renowned as the motherland of wine. The juice is placed in a large bronze cauldron and heated slowly. ...",

Churchkhela (Georgian: \u10e9\u10e3\u10e0\u10e9\u10ee\u10d4\u10da\u10d0, [t\u0283\u02b0urt\u0283\u02b0x\u025bl\u0251]) is a traditional Georgian cuisine candle-shaped candy. The main ingredients are grape must, nuts, and flour. Almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, and chocolate and sometimes raisins are threaded onto a string, dipped in thickened grape juice or fruit juices and dried in the shape of a sausage. The traditional technology of churchkhela in the Kakheti region was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2015.\nChurchkhela and its varieties are popular in several countries besides Georgia, such as Syria \"Aleppo\" as known as zob alkadi \u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0636\u064a, Iran, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Cyprus, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Pakistan and Turkey. In Persian, it's known as \u0628\u0627\u0633\u0644\u0648\u0642 \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0631. In Armenian, Greek, and Turkish it is known as \"sujuk\", which is actually a dry sausage. To distinguish the two, it is sometimes referred to as \"sweet sujukh\" (\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0581\u0580 \u057d\u0578\u0582\u057b\u0578\u0582\u056d, kaghtsr sujukh) in Armenian and cevizli sucuk (\"walnut sujuk\") in Turkish. It is known in Cypriot Greek as shoushoukos (\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2) and as soutzouki (\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03ba\u03b9) in Greece. A variant of Churchkhela, traditionally called Kelawo, is prepared in the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan. It was locally marketed as Hunza chocolate, but as Kelawo does not contain any cocoa, it is now renamed as Hunza Candy.\nThe Cypriot variety is made by dipping strings of almonds into jelly, called palouzes (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03ad\u03c2).\nChurchkhela is a between-meals snack and is also served as a dessert during New Year and Christmas celebrations.\nTraditionally, in times of war women would send their men Churchkhela to eat at the front, because of its pragmatic size, ability not to mold for long periods of time, and heavy texture that keeps one full.\n\nGozinaki\nList of grape dishes\nPestil\nGoldstein, Darra (1999).

Then the pulp is cooked and pured, mixed with sugar in a one-to-one rate, cooked again and then filled hot in jars. This kind of preparation guarantees a long shelf life but, as Vitamin C is not heat-resistant, only traces of it remain in the finished product.

Hagebuttenmark is used as a spread on bread, as sweetener in beverages and as condiment in dessert and pastry. It is for example the filling for Krapfen in Franconia.\nIn the European Union commercially produced Hagebuttenmark has to be declared as \"Hagebuttenkonfit\u00fcre extra\" or \"Konfit\u00fcre einfach\" (fruit preserve onefold).

A recipe recorded in Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura (160 BC) describes placenta as a sweet layered cheese dish: \nShape the placenta as follows: place a single row of tracta along the whole length of the base dough. This is then covered with the mixture [cheese and honey] from the mortar. Place another row of tracta on top and go on doing so until all the cheese and honey have been used up. Finish with a layer of tracta...place the placenta in the oven and put a preheated lid on top of it [...] When ready, honey is poured over the placenta.\nPlacenta remains the name for a flat baked pie containing cheese in Aromanian (pl\u00e3tsint\u00e3) and in Romanian (pl\u0103cint\u0103).\nThe ancient tyropatinum described by Apicius, despite the similarity in name, was a sweet custard with no crust.\nBanitsa\nB\u00f6rek\nGibanica\nPlacenta cake\n\nOzimek, Sarah (1 February 2017). \"TIROPITA (GREEK CHEESE PIES)\".

Wuzetka ( voo-zetka [vuz\u025btka]) is a chocolate sponge and cream pie which originated in Warsaw, Poland. Its name is probably derived from the Warsaw W-Z Route, on which the confectionery that first began to sell the dessert in late 1940s was located. Traditional to Varsovian cuisine, the dessert was exclusively served by caf\u00e9s and restaurants in Warsaw, but soon became a beloved home-made food in Poland.\nThe dessert most likely originated at the turn of the 1940s and 1950s in one of Warsaw's newly-founded sweet shops. However, the precise origin of the name is debatable; historians and certain sources agree that the cake was probably named after the Warsaw W-Z Route (East-West Route), which ran next to the shop. Other sources state that the name comes from the acronym \"WZC\", which either stood for the Warsaw Confectionery Plants (Warszawskie Zak\u0142ady Cukiernicze) or for the Polish term \"pastry with chocolate\" (wypiek z czekolad\u0105). The abbreviation \"WZK\" for \"pastry with cream\" (wypiek z kremem) is also a possibility.\nThe confectionery store was most likely situated somewhere near or in the \"Kino Muran\u00f3w\" cinema building on 5 Andersa Street, in the Muran\u00f3w district of Warsaw.\nList of Polish desserts\nNapoleonka\nKarpatka\n\"Wyborcza.pl\". warszawa.wyborcza.pl.\n\"Niezwyk\u0142e \"wuzetki\" to jeden z symboli Warszawy, lubicie?

He added that the flavor of the fruit \"isn't sweet, although it isn't meaty either, but enough of the browning comes through to make it a little like a piece of meat\".

Eventually the stick is lifted and slowly removed while the dough strips are formed into a loose ball. Using a special round holder called a Schneeballeneisen in order to retain the shape, the ball is deep-fried in boiling fat until golden brown, and finally dusted with confectioner's sugar while warm.

A Schneeball or Schneeballen (plural: Schneeb\u00e4lle and Schneeballen respectively), snowball in English, is a pastry made from shortcrust pastry and is especially popular in the area of Rothenburg ob der Tauber. Its name derives from its round, ball-like shape, with a diameter of about eight to ten centimeters, and its traditional decoration with white confectioner's sugar.  It is also called a Storchennest (stork's nest).\nThis kind of pastry has been known for at least 400 years in the regions of Franconia and Hohenlohe (northeast of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) where it is very popular. Served only on special occasions such as weddings in the past; they are nowadays available throughout the year and can be found around Rothenburg ob der Tauber in bakeries, pastry shops, and cafes. In the town itself there are even companies that specialize in the pastry, constantly coming out with new variations. Beside the classical ones dusted with confectioner's sugar, there are recipes glazed with chocolate and nuts or filled with marzipan. As the pastry is considered the signature dish of the town, it is a very common souvenir.\n\nSeethaler, Susanne (2005).

It is popular in Fujian and has spread to other areas including the Ryukyus, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia including the Malaysian towns of Sitiawan, Sibu, Ayer Tawar, Sarikei, Bintangor and other places where the dominant Chinese community is of Fuzhou (alternatively spelled Foochow or Hokchiu) ancestry (where it is sometimes nicknamed \"Foochow bagels\").\nKompia was named after Qi Jiguang, who invented it. When Qi Jiguang led his troops into Fujian in 1563, the Japanese pirates, fearing his name, engaged mainly in guerrilla-style battles. Qi Jiguang noticed that the Japanese pirates could always trace where his troops camped because of the smoke that rose up to the sky when the soldiers prepared their meals. He found out the Japanese pirates had no such problem because they brought onigiri with them. So Qi Jiguang invented a kind of bread with a hole in the center so that they could be strung together to be conveniently carried along. Later, to commemorate Qi Jiguang's victory against the pirate raiders, the bread was named after him as gu\u0101ng-b\u01d0ng (or \"Guang cake\").\nA variant with sesame seeds scattered on top and baked without any filling is known as \u9ebb\u997c. A sweet variant known as \u5f81\u4e1c\u997c (literally \"Conquest of the East cake\") uses a proportion of sugar to substitute the salt in the dough.\nSimon Richmond, et al.

A club sandwich, also called a clubhouse sandwich, is a sandwich of bread (traditionally toasted), sliced cooked poultry, ham or fried bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise. \nIt is often cut into quarters or halves and held together by cocktail sticks. Modern versions frequently have two layers which are separated by an additional slice of bread.\nThe club sandwich may have originated at the Union Club of New York City. The earliest known reference to the sandwich, an article that appeared in The Evening World on November 18, 1889, is also an early recipe: \"Have you tried a Union Club sandwich yet? Two toasted pieces of Graham bread, with a layer of turkey or chicken and ham between them, served warm.\"  Several other early references also credit the chef of the Union Club with creating the sandwich.\nAnother theory is that the club sandwich was invented at the Saratoga Club in Saratoga Springs, New York, after Richard Canfield bought it and made it into the Canfield Casino in 1894. \nOther sources find the origin of the club sandwich to be up for debate.\nThe sandwich appeared on U.S. restaurant menus as early as 1899. The earliest reference to the sandwich in published fiction is from Conversations of a Chorus Girl, a 1903 book by Ray Cardell. Historically, club sandwiches featured slices of chicken, but with time, turkey has become increasingly common. An 1897 recipe has three layers, with the chicken and ham separated not by a slice of bread, but by a lettuce leaf.\nDagwood sandwich\nList of sandwiches\nBreene, Sophia (March 19, 2013). \"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the Club Sandwich\".

A Dagwood sandwich is a tall, multilayered sandwich made with a variety of meats, cheeses, and condiments. It is named after Dagwood Bumstead, a central character in the comic strip Blondie, who is frequently illustrated making enormous sandwiches. According to Blondie scripter Dean Young, his father, Chic Young, began drawing the huge sandwiches in the comic strip during 1936.\nIn 1951, businessmen Bob Weiler and Art Lang opened a Dagwood-themed restaurant in Toledo, Ohio, with hopes of establishing a national chain. They had not licensed the Dagwood name and were ordered to stop using it by King Features.\nA Dagwood Diner (spelled \"Dag-Wood\") operated in Ann Arbor, Michigan, until 1971.\nAssorted lunch meats featuring Dagwood have been sold at grocery stores. In May 1999, a counter-service restaurant named Blondie's opened at Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure, serving a traditional Dagwood-style sandwich. Blondie's bills itself as \"Home of the Dagwood Sandwich.\" The exterior displays a 20-foot plastic Dagwood sandwich over the entrance.\nDenny's in the early 2000s offered their breakfast Dagwood; it contained over a thousand calories. It was later removed from their menu.\nDagwood's Sandwich Shoppes, a Blondie-themed restaurant chain founded in 2006, had franchise locations open in Florida, Kentucky, Indiana, Missouri, and Georgia that have all closed as of 2011. The chain struggled financially and never reached the growth anticipated by its founders. Two lawsuits were filed alleging mismanagement, fraud, embezzlement, and deliberate deception of the chain's financial state as it collapsed. The Dagwood was sold as a 1.5-pound sandwich. The Dagwood sandwich served in the Dagwood Sandwich Shoppes included the following ingredients: three slices of deli bread, Genoa salami, ham, pepperoni, turkey, cheddar cheese, provolone, lettuce, tomato, roasted red bell peppers, banana peppers, red onion, deli mustard, and low calorie mayonnaise.\nCincinnati-based chain Penn Station East Coast Subs refers to its \"create-it-yourself\" submarine sandwich as a Dagwood. A customer may include up to five meats, and any combination of available condiments and vegetables.\nDagwoods are also a popular sandwich in South African takeaway (fast-food) restaurants and roadhouses, both in small street-side stands and larger chains. A South African Dagwood is usually made with three slices of toasted bread with a hamburger patty (or two), along with lettuce, tomato, and a fried egg. Other common accoutrements may be added and the beef patty may be replaced by savory mince reminiscent of an American sloppy joe, but it seems to be the fried egg and double-decker nature of the sandwich that characterizes a South African Dagwood.\nIn 2008, Man v. Food host Adam Richman visited Columbus, Ohio, and partook in the Ohio Deli and Restaurant's Dagwood Challenge. The challenge was to eat a 2-1\u20442-pound Dagwood sandwich, plus a full pound of French fries, within 30 minutes. Richman successfully ate the sandwich and fries in 20 of the 30 minutes and was awarded with commemorative T-shirt.\nDagwood's Deli and Sub Shop opened in Indiana in 1985, now serving several locations.  On the menu is a \"Dagwood Supreme\", which includes roast beef, ham, turkey, provolone and Colby cheeses, lettuce, tomato, and onions and a \"Dagwood\" sauce.\nDagwoods Sandwichs et Salades is a fast-food chain operating in Canada. It was founded in 1989 in Montr\u00e9al but subsequently expanded throughout Qu\u00e9bec and into Eastern Ontario.\nCaspar Milquetoast\nDream of the Rarebit Fiend\nJiggs dinner\nList of American sandwiches\nList of sandwiches\nSandwich loaf, a type of party food made from a whole loaf of bread\n\"History of Dagwood Sandwich\".

A tuna fish sandwich, also known as a tuna salad sandwich or a tuna sandwich, is a sandwich made from canned tuna\u2014usually made into a tuna salad by adding mayonnaise, and sometimes other ingredients such as celery or onion\u2014as well as other common fruits and vegetables used to flavor sandwiches. It is commonly served on sliced bread. \nVariations include the tuna boat (served on a bun or roll) and the tuna melt (served with melted cheese). The more general term of tuna sandwich may also refer to cuisine utilizing filet of raw or cooked tuna, rather than canned tuna.\nIn the United States, 52% of canned tuna is used for sandwiches. The tuna sandwich has been called \"the mainstay of almost everyone's American childhood.\"\nThe dish's popularity started to climb in the early twentieth century, but tuna sandwiches were already being served in nineteenth century homes. In 1893, Dell Montjoy Bradley, a New York socialite, wrote a gourmet cookbook called Beverages and Sandwiches for Your Husband's Friends. She included a recipe for a sandwich made out of imported  tuna that she described using the Italian word \"tonno.\"\nThe sandwich is \"emblematic of America\u2019s working-class spirit\" and its status \"rests on three post\u2013Industrial Revolution convenience foods: canned tuna, presliced wheat bread, and mayonnaise,\" according to James Beard Foundation Award winner Mari Uyehara. Canning of tuna began in the United States around 1904, and it was increasingly popular as a lower cost alternative to canned salmon by the 1920s. German immigrant Richard Hellmann began mass-producing mayonnaise, the other major ingredient of tuna salad, in New York City around 1905, for use by commercial food service businesses. By 1912, he was selling wide mouthed glass jars of mayonnaise to retail customers, under the brand name Hellmann's. Commercial sliced bread was introduced in the United States in 1928, was sold nationally by 1930 and accounted for the majority of U.S. bread sales by 1933. \nReuben Swinburne Clymer was the grand master of the leading American Rosicrucian organization Fraternitas Rosae Crucis from 1922 to 1966. He was an advocate of a pescatarian or fish/vegetarian diet. In 1917, he co-authored The Rose Cross Aid Cook Book with Clara Witt. The book included a recipe for seafood sandwiches, including variations for canned salmon, canned shrimp and canned tuna. The seafood was removed from the can, placed on slices of buttered bread spread with a teaspoon of mayonnaise, and a lettuce leaf was added. An institutional cookbook published in 1924 included a recipe for making a batch of 50 tuna sandwiches.

It consists of rice cooked in goat meat broth, goat milk, and clarified butter (most often ghee). It is popular among the Arab community in Indonesia and Betawi people in Jakarta. Nasi kebuli was influenced by Arab culture and its origin can be traced to Middle eastern cuisine, especially Yemeni Arabian influence (mandi rice or kabsa), Indian cuisine influence (biryani rice), and Afghan influence (kabuli palaw).\nIn Betawi culture, nasi kebuli  is usually served during Islamic religious festivities, such as Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha or Mawlid (birthday of Muhammad). Outside Jakarta,  nasi kebuli is mainly popular in regions with significant population of Arab Indonesians, such as West Java, Banten, Surakarta, Surabaya, Gresik and Banyuwangi.\nNasi kebuli gets its name and traces its origin from the kabuli palaw, which is an Afghan variety of pilaf from Kabul, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent,  but with heavy influence of Hadhrami and Indian cuisine such as Mandi and Biryani in the cooking methods and seasoning.\nThe Middle Eastern version of kabuli rice is more similar to kabuli palaw than Indonesian nasi kebuli. The word pilaf, palau or palaw simply means a rice dish cooked with a seasoned broth. According to history, the dish was brought to the Middle-East from the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia. One distinction is the presence of shredded carrots and perhaps grapes in the Middle-east or Afghan version of Kebuli.\nList of goat dishes\nNasi bogana\nNasi campur\nNasi goreng\nNasi kucing\nNasi kuning\nNasi lemak\nNasi liwet\nNasi minyak\nNasi pecel\nNasi uduk\nNasi ulam\n\"Nasi Kebuli Gaya Betawi\".

It is a sweetened condensed milk made by boiling milk on low heat until the milk is reduced by half. In North India, a similar dish goes by the name rabri.\nIt is often made on Hindu festivals such as Kali Chaudas and Bhaubeej (Bhai Dooj).\nDifferent styles of basundi are also prepared, such as sitaphal (custard apple) basundi and angoor basundi (basundi with smaller kinds of rasgullas).\nBasundi can be served hot, warm or chilled. It is often served with puris (fried Indian flatbread).\nThis milk that is flavored with cardamom powder and saffron basundi varies as per the quantity of saffron. Add less for mild colour.

Basundi is an perishable item so needs to be preserved carefully. This item needs to be consumed with in 2\u20133 days from the date of manufacturing.\nHeavy cream may be added during the boiling process to hasten the thickening process.

The word pilaf, palau or palaw simply means a rice dish cooked with a seasoned broth. According to history, the dish was brought to the Middle-East from the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia.

                "description": "Rogan josh consists of pieces of lamb or mutton braised with a gravy flavoured with garlic, ginger and aromatic spices (cloves, bay leaves, cardamom, and cinnamon), and in some versions incorporating onions or yogurt. After initial braising, the dish may be finished using the dampokhtak slow cooking technique. Its characteristic deep red colour traditionally comes from dried flowers or root of Alkanna tinctoria (ratan jot) and from liberal amounts of dried, deseeded Kashmiri chilies (lal mirch). These chilies, whose flavor approximates that of paprika, are considerably milder than the typical dried cayenne pepper of Indian cuisine. The recipe's spice emphasises aroma rather than heat. Saffron is also part of some traditional recipes. ...",

It is made with red meat\u2014traditionally lamb, mutton, or goat\u2014and coloured and flavoured primarily by alkanet flower (or root) and Kashmiri chilies. It is one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine.\nA number of origins of the name have been suggested. Roughan means \"clarified butter\" or \"oil\" in Persian and Urdu, while ju\u0161 (alternatively romanised josh) means to \"stew\" or \"braise\" and ultimately derives from the verb ju\u0161idan meaning \"to boil\". Rogan josh, by this definition, may mean \"stewed in ghee\".\nAn alternative etymology is that the name derives from either the Urdu word roghan (Urdu: \u0631\u0648\u063a\u0646\u200e), \"brown\" or \"red\", or the Kashmiri roghan, \"red\", along with the word either for \"meat\", (go\u0161t) often romanized as \"rogan ghosht\" or \"gosht\", or a word meaning \"juice\", giving possible meanings of \"red meat\" or \"red juice\". The exact etymology remains uncertain as both \"rogan josh\" and \"rogan ghosht\" are used to refer to the dish and it is unclear which of the names is the original.\nRogan josh is a staple of Kashmiri cuisine and is one of the main dishes of the Kashmiri multicourse meal (the wazwan). The dish was originally brought to Kashmir by the Mughals, whose cuisine was, in turn, influenced by Persian cuisine. The unrelenting summer heat of the Indian plains took the Mughals frequently to Kashmir, which has a cooler climate because of its elevation and latitude.\nWhile the traditional preparation uses whole dried chilies that are de-seeded, soaked in water, and ground to a paste, non-traditional shortcuts use either Kashmiri chili powder (available in Indian stores) or a mixture of paprika (predominantly) and cayenne pepper, adjusted to taste. (Madhur Jaffrey's recipe calls for a 4:1 ratio of paprika to cayenne.) An updated version served in Sanjeev Kapoor's restaurants uses white and black cardamom, anise, and bay leaves.\nMany western interpretations of the dish add tomatoes to the sauce. This is especially common with ready-made pour-over cooking sauces to the point where the dish may be considered tomato-based. The authenticity of including tomatoes is disputed: some authors state that tomatoes are not part of the traditional dish or of traditional Indian cuisine and should not be included. However, other authors have specifically referred to rogan josh as a dish based around meat and tomatoes, while others have identified tomatoes with a Punjabi version of the dish as opposed to a Kashmiri one.\nIn India, rogan josh is often made with goat instead of mutton, due to its wider availability. There is a variety with beef as well, brisket being preferred.\nRogan Josh, Oxford Learners' Dictionary\nMagon, Harminder Singh (2016). My Epicurean Journey.

Kransekage (Danish) or kransekake (Norwegian) is a traditional Danish and Norwegian confection, often eaten on special occasions in Scandinavia. In English, the name means wreath cake. In Norway it is alternatively referred to as t\u00e5rnkake (English: tower cake) and often prepared for Constitution Day celebrations, Christmas, weddings, and baptisms. In Denmark it is typically eaten as part of New Year celebrations, while a variation of the cake, Overfl\u00f8dighedshorn, is traditionally served at weddings and baptisms.\nThe origin of the Kransekage can be traced to the 18th century, where it was first created by a baker in Copenhagen.\nThis confection is served by separating individual rings and breaking them into smaller pieces. In recent years the kransekake when mass-produced is sold year round in the shape of dessert bars. Mass-produced kransekake is available in stores around Christmas and before New Year's Eve.\nOne cultural tradition is for the bride and groom to lift the top layer of the cake at their wedding. The number of cake rings that stick to the top one when they lift it is said to be the number of children the couple will have.\nThe world tallest Kransekake was baked in 2006 by the supermarket Coop in Oslo in celebration of their 100th anniversary. The cake was 13.17 meters tall and made from over 700 kilograms of dough.\nThe original variant used at weddings is called overfl\u00f8dighedshorn (English: horn of plenty) and is shaped like a cornucopia and filled with chocolates, cookies, and other small treats. Sometimes a bottle of wine or akvavit is placed in the center, and the cake is decorated with ornaments such as crackers and flags.\nBite-sized versions of the cake, called Kransekakestenger (English: wreath cake rods) are often prepared for Christmas. The cake is prepared in the same way as with the original version, but instead of being formed into rings they are set into small, straight portions between 5\u20138\u00a0cm (2\u20133\u00a0in) long. They are then similarly decorated with white icing, though they may also be dipped in chocolate.\n\nDanish cuisine\u00a0\u2013 Culinary traditions of Denmark\nNorwegian cuisine\u00a0\u2013 Culinary traditions of Norway\nList of Norwegian desserts\u00a0\u2013 Wikimedia list article\nNarten H\u00f8berg, Eva (22 December 2020). \"Kransekake\".

Palmiers are made from puff pastry, a laminated dough similar to the dough used for croissant, but without yeast. Puff pastry is made with alternating layers of dough and butter, rolled and folded over to create possibly hundreds of flaky layers. The puff pastry is rolled out, coated with sugar, and then the two sides are rolled up together so that they meet in the middle, making a roll that is then cut into about 1\u20444\u00a0in (6\u00a0mm) slices and baked.

In Catalonia and Valencia they are called ulleres (eyeglasses) or palmeras.  In Spain they are called palmeras (palm trees), and they can be topped with coconut or chocolate.

It is a salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, bottarga, and dried tuna dressed with olive oil.\nCappon magro means 'fast-day capon'. As the dish contains no ingredients considered meat under the rules of traditional Catholic fasting, it is a suitable meal for the traditional Catholic fast days, including Christmas Eve. 'Capon' may be a wry reference to the poultry capon, a traditional dish for Christmas.  Or it may refer to the biscuit base, comparable to the French 'chapon', a slice of bread rubbed with garlic which is placed in the bottom of a soup or salad bowl. It may also refer to one of the many fish called 'cappone' (perhaps a gurnard or red mullet).\nThe Naples dish called \"Caponata Estiva\" 'Summer Caponata', \"Caponata Napolitana\", or \"Caponata di Pesce\" consists of moistened ring-shaped rusks (friselle or gallette) dressed with oil, salt, garlic, oregano and basil, and topped with sliced tomatoes and possibly tuna. Any number of additional ingredients are optional, including smoked herring, pickled vegetables, olives, capers, anchovies, sardines, hard boiled eggs, very thinly sliced boiled beef, cucumber, carrot, celery.\nCappon magro is a traditional dish for Christmas Eve.\nList of Italian dishes\nList of salads\nCuisine of Liguria\nTouring Club Italiano, Guida all'Italia gastronomica, p. 192\nWaverly Root, The Food of Italy, 1971, ISBN\u00a00-394-72429-1, p. 362\nGillian Riley, The Oxford Companion to Italian Food, p. 290\nJeanne C.

White pudding, oatmeal pudding or (in Scotland) mealy pudding is a meat dish popular in Scotland, Ireland, Northumberland, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. \nWhite pudding is broadly similar to black pudding, but does not include blood. Modern recipes consist of suet or fat, oatmeal or barley, breadcrumbs and in some cases pork and pork liver, filled into a natural or cellulose sausage casing. Recipes in previous centuries included a wider range of ingredients.\nWhite pudding is often thought of as a very old dish that, like black pudding, was a traditional way of making use of offal following the annual slaughter of livestock. Whereas black pudding-type recipes appear in Roman sources, white pudding likely has specifically medieval origins, possibly as a culinary descendant of medieval sweetened blancmange-type recipes combining shredded chicken, rice and almonds, or as a way of lightening up offal with the addition of cream, eggs and breadcrumbs. Meatless versions were common, as they could be eaten during the Lenten period of abstinence. Many older recipes are sweetened: a 15th century British pudding combined pork liver, cream, eggs, breadcrumbs, raisins and dates, while a 1588 recipe collection featured a white pudding made of beef suet, breadcrumbs, egg yolk and currants, flavoured with nutmeg, sugar and cinnamon. A similar recipe given in Woolley's 1670 book The Queen-Like Closet used hog's lights and was filled into intestine sausage-skins. By the mid-18th century, Elizabeth Raffald's white pudding recipe, \"White Puddings in Skins\", combined rice, lard, ground almonds, currants and egg, using sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and mace as flavourings; by this period the inclusion of offal such as liver or lights, as well as sweet flavourings, was becoming rarer.\nAn oatmeal pudding recipe found in the 18th century Compleat Housewife is made with beef suet and cream, thickened with oatmeal and mixed up with egg yolks, then baked in a dish with marrow.\nAlongside these more refined and elaborate recipes, a simpler form of white pudding was popular in Ireland, Scotland, and some parts of Northern England, combining suet, oatmeal (or barley in Northumberland), seasoning and onions, in sheep's or cow's intestines.  In Gaelic speaking parts of Scotland and Ireland they were referred to by the names marag gheal or put\u00f3g bh\u00e1n. These oatmeal-based puddings survived into modern Irish and Scottish cuisine, although with significant regional differences. Modern commercially made Scottish white puddings are generally based on oatmeal, onions, and beef suet; the same mixture simply fried in a pan is known as skirlie. In Ireland, white puddings also include a substantial proportion of pork or pork liver and pork fat. Most modern white puddings are filled into a synthetic cellulose casing and boiled or steamed; typical spices used include white pepper, nutmeg, and sage.\nWhite puddings were once also associated with south-western England: Taylor, in the 17th century, mentions \"the white puddings of Somersetshire\". Hog's pudding, still made in Somerset, Cornwall and Devon, is very similar to other white puddings although is somewhat more highly spiced.\nAnother Scottish variant, fruit pudding, includes dried fruit in addition to beef suet and oatmeal.\nBoudin\nGoetta\nHaggis\nRed pudding\nScrapple\nList of Irish dishes\nSee, for instance, James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man: \"White pudding and eggs and sausages and cups of tea!

The liquid part of the dish is known as Tora\u1e47i (Odia: \u0b24\u0b4b\u0b30\u0b3e\u0b23\u0b3f \u1e6dor\u0101\u1e47i). It is popular in the state of Odisha and its similar variants in the eastern regions like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bengal and the northeastern states of Assam and Tripura.\nIt is a preparation that is consumed during summer, although many people eat it throughout the year, especially for lunch. It is popular among the public as it provides a refreshing food source during the hot climate and replenishes the nutrients in the body. A traditional Odia dish, it is prepared with rice, curd, cucumber, cumin seeds, fried onions and mint leaves. It is popularly served with dry roasted vegetables\u2014such as potato, brinjal, badi and saga bhaja or fried fish.\nThe term \"pakhala\" is derived from Pali word \"pakh\u0101\u1e37it\u0101\" (Odia: \u0b2a\u0b16\u0b3e\u0b33\u0b3f\u0b24\u0b3e) as well as Sanskrit word \"Praksh\u0101\u1e37a\u1e47a\" (Sanskrit: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0933\u0928) which means \"washed/to wash.\"\nIt is unknown when pakha\u1e37a was first included in the daily diet of Eastern India, but it was included in the recipe of Lord Jagannath Temple of Puri circa 10th cen. Pakha\u1e37a is eaten in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent (including Nepal and some parts of Myanmar). The word pakha\u1e37a was used in the Odia poems of Arjuna Das in his literary work Ka\u1e37palata (1520-1530 AD).\nThe different types of Pakhala classified as per preparation:\nSaja Pakha\u1e37a (fresh pakha\u1e37a) is prepared by adding water instantly after making freshly cooked rice with drops of lemon in it. This variant doesn't need fermentation.\nBasi Pakha\u1e37a (stale pakhala, basi in Odia means \"stale\") is prepared by fermenting rice by adding water which is generally kept overnight and eaten in the next day. This variant of pakhala follows the traditional method of preparation. People also eat it with badi chura along with diced onions and lemon to add flavors to the dish.\nJira Pakha\u1e37a is prepared by adding fried cumin with curry leaves to the pakha\u1e37a.\nDahi Pakha\u1e37a is prepared by adding curd to the pakha\u1e37a. Badi chura is taken as a side dish with pakhala.\nChain pakahala or Garama pakhala (hot pakhala) is similar to saja pakhala (fresh pakhala) but is served with hot rice.\nPaani Pakhala is a common variant prepared by only adding salt and water to the cooked rice.\nAda Pakhala is prepared by adding ginger and salt to the cooked rice soaked in water.\nSugandhi Pakhala or Subasa Pakhala (flavored pakhala) is prepared by adding chopped or grated ginger and roasted cumin seeds to cooked rice submerged in salty water which gives an aroma to the pakhala.\nChupuda Pakhala (squeezed pakhala) is prepared by squeezing out the cooked rice washed in water and served with curd, roasted cumin and salt.\nMitha Pakhala (sweet pakhala) is prepared by adding sugar or jaggery to cooked rice and water along with roasted cumin. It is an unusual variant and not popular compared to popular fresh or stale pakhala. Sometimes oranges are added as well.\nTabhaa Pakhala is prepared by adding lemon water to the cooked rice.\nGhia Pakhala is prepared by adding ghee to the cooked rice.\nMalliphula Pakhala is prepared by malli flowers(jasmine) to the cooked rice for aroma.\nPakha\u1e37a is slightly fermented rice. The rice is cooked, water is added with little bit of old pakhal (something similar to making curd using milk and old curd). Pakha\u1e37a tastes best when served after 8 to 12 hours after preparation; in this case, no old pakhal is required to be added to the rice as fermentation usually happens after 6 hours of keeping rice in water. The Pakhala by itself tastes a bit sour, but also paste of green chilli, green Mango and ginger is added to give the Pakhala a little bit hot and sweet flavour.\nGenerally burnt potato or aloo poda (boiled is also used) and other fried vegetables or fried fish is served with pakha\u1e37a. Various side dishes include dahi baigana, kakharu phula bhaja (fried pumpkin flowers), mashed potatoes (alu bharata), fried fish (macha bhaja), fried prawns (chingudi bhaja), sukhua (dried fish) and saga bhaja (fired leafy vegetables).\nTo promote the cuisine in modern era, Pakhala Dibasa was declared on 20 March 2015 by popular initiative to be celebrated by Odias worldwide. Thus 20 March is celebrated every year as Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) by Odias across the regions where people eat and promote the cuisine.\nChhattisgarh: bore bhat\nJharkhand: paani bhat\nGujurat: Ghesh Bhat\nTamil Nadu: pazhedhu saadham\nAndhra Pradesh: saddi annam\nBengal: panta bhat\nAssam: poita bhat\nList of Indian dishes\nCuisine of Odisha\nJ.

Tarhana is a dried food ingredient, based on a fermented mixture of grain and yoghurt or fermented milk, found in the cuisines of Southeast Europe and the Middle East. Dry tarhana has a texture of coarse, uneven crumbs, and it is usually made into a thick soup with water, stock, or milk. As it is both acidic and low in moisture, the milk proteins keep for long periods. Tarhana is very similar to some kinds of kashk.\nThe Armenian tarkhana is made up of matzoon and eggs mixed with equal amounts of wheat flour and starch. Small pieces of dough are prepared and dried and then kept in glass containers and used mostly in soups, dissolving in hot liquids. The Greek trahanas contains only cracked wheat or a couscous-like paste and fermented milk. The Turkish tarhana consists of cracked wheat (or flour), yoghurt, and vegetables, fermented and then dried. In Cyprus, it is considered a national specialty, and is often served with pieces of halloumi cheese in it. In Albania it is prepared with wheat, yoghurt and butter, and served with hot olive oil and feta cheese.\nHill and Bryer suggest that tarhana is related to Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd (trakton, romanized as tractum), a thickener Apicius wrote about in the 1st century CE which most other authors consider to be a sort of cracker crumb. Dalby (1996) connects it to the Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2/\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 (tragos/traganos), described (and condemned) in Galen's Geoponica 3.8. Weaver (2002) also considers it of Western origin.\nPerry, on the other hand, considers that the phonetic evolution of \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 to tarhana is unlikely, and that it probably comes from  Persian: \u062a\u0631\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u200e tarkhw\u0101neh.

Tar \u062a\u0631 in Persian means 'wet, soaked', and khw\u0101n \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646 (pronounced kh\u0101n) means 'dining place/table, food, large wooden bowl'. Thus in Persian it would mean 'watered or soaked food', which matches the way the soup is made: tarhana must be soaked in water, and other possible ingredients are then added and cooked for some time.\nRegional variations of the name include (Armenian  \u0569\u0561\u0580\u056d\u0561\u0576\u0561; Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c2 trahanas or (\u03be\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc)\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (xyno)hondros; Persian \u062a\u0631\u062e\u06cc\u0646\u0647\u060c \u062a\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647\u060c \u062a\u0631\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647 tarkhineh, tarkh\u0101neh, tarkhw\u0101neh; Kurdish) tarxane, Albanian trahana, Bulgarian \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0430 or \u0442\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0430', Serbo-Croatian  tarana or trahana; or Turkish tarhana.\nTrahanas is made by mixing flour, yoghurt or sour milk, and optionally cooked vegetables, salt, groats, and spices (notably tarhana herb), letting the mixture ferment, then drying, and usually grinding and sieving the result.  The fermentation produces lactic acid and other compounds giving tarhana its characteristic sour taste and good keeping properties: the pH is lowered to 3.4-4.2, and the drying step reduces the moisture content to 6-10%, resulting in a medium inhospitable to pathogens and spoilage organisms, while preserving the milk proteins.\nList of soups\nTarhonya, a Hungarian noodle whose name comes from tarhana\nFrumenty, a Western European equivalent\nKashk (qurut)\nTsampa, a similar product in Tibet and Nepal\n\u00a0food portal\n\"Tarkhana\" (in Russian).

Finally, curd and salt are added.

Curd rice, also called yogurt rice, is a dish originating from India. The word \"curd\" in Indian English refers to unsweetened probiotic yogurt. It is most popular in the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala ,  Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh; and also in Maharashtra.\nIn the state of Maharashtra it is known as dahi bhat. In the state of Tamil Nadu it is called thayir saadam, in Kerala it is called tayire ch\u014dre and in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh it is called perugannam/daddojanam. In Karnataka, it is called mosaranna. The dish is a staple of traditional cuisine, with the untempered version present at the end of almost every South Indian meal. The tempered version is often served during formal occasions and also offered as prasadam (blessed food) to devotees in temples.\nCurd rice is often eaten accompanied by South Asian pickles. In South Indian cuisine, curd rice is traditionally eaten at the end of lunch and dinner, as this helps ease the effects of spicy food consumed prior. It is also said to aid digestion, as well as to balance the effects of the warm climate.\nCuisine of India\nList of rice dishes\nRice congee\nSouth Indian cuisine\nUdupi cuisine\nChandra, Smita (1991).

The liquid part of the dish is known as Tora\u1e47i (Odia: \u0b24\u0b4b\u0b30\u0b3e\u0b23\u0b3f \u1e6dor\u0101\u1e47i). It is popular in the state of Odisha and its similar variants in the eastern regions like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bengal and the northeastern states of Assam and Tripura.\nIt is a preparation that is consumed during summer, although many people eat it throughout the year, especially for lunch. It is popular among the public as it provides a refreshing food source during the hot climate and replenishes the nutrients in the body. A traditional Odia dish, it is prepared with rice, curd, cucumber, cumin seeds, fried onions and mint leaves. It is popularly served with dry roasted vegetables\u2014such as potato, brinjal, badi and saga bhaja or fried fish.\nThe term \"pakhala\" is derived from Pali word \"pakh\u0101\u1e37it\u0101\" (Odia: \u0b2a\u0b16\u0b3e\u0b33\u0b3f\u0b24\u0b3e) as well as Sanskrit word \"Praksh\u0101\u1e37a\u1e47a\" (Sanskrit: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0933\u0928) which means \"washed/to wash.\"\nIt is unknown when pakha\u1e37a was first included in the daily diet of Eastern India, but it was included in the recipe of Lord Jagannath Temple of Puri circa 10th cen. Pakha\u1e37a is eaten in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent (including Nepal and some parts of Myanmar). The word pakha\u1e37a was used in the Odia poems of Arjuna Das in his literary work Ka\u1e37palata (1520-1530 AD).\nThe different types of Pakhala classified as per preparation:\nSaja Pakha\u1e37a (fresh pakha\u1e37a) is prepared by adding water instantly after making freshly cooked rice with drops of lemon in it. This variant doesn't need fermentation.\nBasi Pakha\u1e37a (stale pakhala, basi in Odia means \"stale\") is prepared by fermenting rice by adding water which is generally kept overnight and eaten in the next day. This variant of pakhala follows the traditional method of preparation. People also eat it with badi chura along with diced onions and lemon to add flavors to the dish.\nJira Pakha\u1e37a is prepared by adding fried cumin with curry leaves to the pakha\u1e37a.\nDahi Pakha\u1e37a is prepared by adding curd to the pakha\u1e37a. Badi chura is taken as a side dish with pakhala.\nChain pakahala or Garama pakhala (hot pakhala) is similar to saja pakhala (fresh pakhala) but is served with hot rice.\nPaani Pakhala is a common variant prepared by only adding salt and water to the cooked rice.\nAda Pakhala is prepared by adding ginger and salt to the cooked rice soaked in water.\nSugandhi Pakhala or Subasa Pakhala (flavored pakhala) is prepared by adding chopped or grated ginger and roasted cumin seeds to cooked rice submerged in salty water which gives an aroma to the pakhala.\nChupuda Pakhala (squeezed pakhala) is prepared by squeezing out the cooked rice washed in water and served with curd, roasted cumin and salt.\nMitha Pakhala (sweet pakhala) is prepared by adding sugar or jaggery to cooked rice and water along with roasted cumin. It is an unusual variant and not popular compared to popular fresh or stale pakhala. Sometimes oranges are added as well.\nTabhaa Pakhala is prepared by adding lemon water to the cooked rice.\nGhia Pakhala is prepared by adding ghee to the cooked rice.\nMalliphula Pakhala is prepared by malli flowers(jasmine) to the cooked rice for aroma.\nPakha\u1e37a is slightly fermented rice. The rice is cooked, water is added with little bit of old pakhal (something similar to making curd using milk and old curd). Pakha\u1e37a tastes best when served after 8 to 12 hours after preparation; in this case, no old pakhal is required to be added to the rice as fermentation usually happens after 6 hours of keeping rice in water. The Pakhala by itself tastes a bit sour, but also paste of green chilli, green Mango and ginger is added to give the Pakhala a little bit hot and sweet flavour.\nGenerally burnt potato or aloo poda (boiled is also used) and other fried vegetables or fried fish is served with pakha\u1e37a. Various side dishes include dahi baigana, kakharu phula bhaja (fried pumpkin flowers), mashed potatoes (alu bharata), fried fish (macha bhaja), fried prawns (chingudi bhaja), sukhua (dried fish) and saga bhaja (fired leafy vegetables).\nTo promote the cuisine in modern era, Pakhala Dibasa was declared on 20 March 2015 by popular initiative to be celebrated by Odias worldwide.

Traditionally, dried corn was ground in a mortar into cornmeal and cooked in a pot with water. Finely cut pieces of young piglet or calf meat was added. The dish was served cold and could keep up to a month.\nThe hominy corn can be soaked and cleaned overnight or can be covered with hot water to remove the husks. After draining and removal of debris, the hominy is once again covered with water, salt is added, and the pashofa is cooked over a low heat for many hours. Bacon and pork can be added.\nSpecialized paddles and spoons, carved from wood or animal horns, were used in stirring, serving, and eating pashofa. Several of these are currently in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution. Pashofa was cooked in giant bowls, often over an open fire outdoors.\nThe Pashofa Dance is a healing ceremony among the Chickasaw and Choctaw. A sick person could be left in a room, alone except for a medicine man. A striped black and white pole is placed in the sick person's yard, and no one else walks past the pole. While the medicine man says medicinal formula over the sick person to drive out the \"Spirit of Disease called Shulop,\" others dance outside.

It is particularly popular among Muslim Filipinos, including among the Maguindanao, Maranao, Sama-Bajau, and Tausug people. It is commonly served during special occasions and religious holidays (notably during Hari Raya). It is also a traditional dish among native Christian and animist Lumad groups, like the Mansaka and non-Islamized communities of the Sama-Bajau.",

The liquid part of the dish is known as Torai (Odia:  ori). It is popular in the state of Odisha and its similar variants in the eastern regions like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bengal and the northeastern states of Assam and Tripura. It is a preparation that is consumed during summer, although many people eat it throughout the year, especially for lunch. It is popular among the public as it provides a refreshing food source during the hot climate and replenishes the nutrients in the body.

The term \"pakhala\" is derived from Pali word \"pakh\u0101\u1e37it\u0101\" (Odia: \u0b2a\u0b16\u0b3e\u0b33\u0b3f\u0b24\u0b3e) as well as Sanskrit word \"Praksh\u0101\u1e37a\u1e47a\" (Sanskrit: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0933\u0928) which means \"washed/to wash.\"\nIt is unknown when pakha\u1e37a was first included in the daily diet of Eastern India, but it was included in the recipe of Lord Jagannath Temple of Puri circa 10th cen. Pakha\u1e37a is eaten in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent (including Nepal and some parts of Myanmar). The word pakha\u1e37a was used in the Odia poems of Arjuna Das in his literary work Ka\u1e37palata (1520-1530 AD).\nThe different types of Pakhala classified as per preparation:\nSaja Pakha\u1e37a (fresh pakha\u1e37a) is prepared by adding water instantly after making freshly cooked rice with drops of lemon in it. This variant doesn't need fermentation.\nBasi Pakha\u1e37a (stale pakhala, basi in Odia means \"stale\") is prepared by fermenting rice by adding water which is generally kept overnight and eaten in the next day. This variant of pakhala follows the traditional method of preparation. People also eat it with badi chura along with diced onions and lemon to add flavors to the dish.\nJira Pakha\u1e37a is prepared by adding fried cumin with curry leaves to the pakha\u1e37a.\nDahi Pakha\u1e37a is prepared by adding curd to the pakha\u1e37a. Badi chura is taken as a side dish with pakhala.\nChain pakahala or Garama pakhala (hot pakhala) is similar to saja pakhala (fresh pakhala) but is served with hot rice.\nPaani Pakhala is a common variant prepared by only adding salt and water to the cooked rice.\nAda Pakhala is prepared by adding ginger and salt to the cooked rice soaked in water.\nSugandhi Pakhala or Subasa Pakhala (flavored pakhala) is prepared by adding chopped or grated ginger and roasted cumin seeds to cooked rice submerged in salty water which gives an aroma to the pakhala.\nChupuda Pakhala (squeezed pakhala) is prepared by squeezing out the cooked rice washed in water and served with curd, roasted cumin and salt.\nMitha Pakhala (sweet pakhala) is prepared by adding sugar or jaggery to cooked rice and water along with roasted cumin. It is an unusual variant and not popular compared to popular fresh or stale pakhala. Sometimes oranges are added as well.\nTabhaa Pakhala is prepared by adding lemon water to the cooked rice.\nGhia Pakhala is prepared by adding ghee to the cooked rice.\nMalliphula Pakhala is prepared by malli flowers(jasmine) to the cooked rice for aroma.\nThe dish is typically prepared with rice that is cooked and allowed to cool. Cook normal rice, then cool it. Pour water in a bowl and add rice to it. In a pan, heat a pinch of oil, add mustard seeds, curry leaves, dry red chili and fry well. Add this chhunka or tadka into the pakhala bowl with sour curd. One can add mint leaves and raw salt to enhance the taste. To add more zing, one may opt for fish fry or sukhua poda (dry fish fried), saga bhaja, badi chura (a regional food item made up of batter of urad or black gram by drying under sunshine as small nuts and then fried to serve) and much more. Cumin seeds are fried, ground into a fine powder and added to curd with coriander leaves and salt.It is sometimes served with a fish fry and spinach.\nPakha\u1e37a is slightly fermented rice. The rice is cooked, water is added with little bit of old pakhal (something similar to making curd using milk and old curd). Pakha\u1e37a tastes best when served after 8 to 12 hours after preparation; in this case, no old pakhal is required to be added to the rice as fermentation usually happens after 6 hours of keeping rice in water. The Pakhala by itself tastes a bit sour, but also paste of green chilli, green Mango and ginger is added to give the Pakhala a little bit hot and sweet flavour.\nGenerally burnt potato or aloo poda (boiled is also used) and other fried vegetables or fried fish is served with pakha\u1e37a. Various side dishes include dahi baigana, kakharu phula bhaja (fried pumpkin flowers), mashed potatoes (alu bharata), fried fish (macha bhaja), fried prawns (chingudi bhaja), sukhua (dried fish) and saga bhaja (fired leafy vegetables).\nTo promote the cuisine in modern era, Pakhala Dibasa was declared on 20 March 2015 by popular initiative to be celebrated by Odias worldwide. Thus 20 March is celebrated every year as Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) by Odias across the regions where people eat and promote the cuisine.\nChhattisgarh: bore bhat\nJharkhand: paani bhat\nGujurat: Ghesh Bhat\nTamil Nadu: pazhedhu saadham\nAndhra Pradesh: saddi annam\nBengal: panta bhat\nAssam: poita bhat\nList of Indian dishes\nCuisine of Odisha\nJ.

Literary references to the burning of medicinal pastilles include the short story \"The Birth-Mark\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, the poem \"The Laboratory\" by Robert Browning, and the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb.

Pastizzi are usually diamond-shaped or round-shaped  (known as pastizzi tax-xema' in Maltese) and made with a pastry very much like the Greek filo pastry (although there is also a puff pastry version). The pastry is folded in different ways according to the filling. They are typically baked on metal trays in electric or gas ovens in a pastizzerija, usually a small or family concern. They are also sold in bars, cafes and by street vendors. They are a popular breakfast in outer villages.\nPastizzi are also produced by Maltese immigrant communities in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US. The first pastizzeria in Scotland opened in 2007.\nSuch is its popularity, the word \"pastizzi\" has multiple meanings in Maltese. It is used as a euphemism for the female sexual organ, due to its shape, and for describing someone as a \"pushover\". The Maltese idiom jinbieg\u0127u b\u0127all-pastizzi (selling like pastizzi) is equivalent to the English \"selling like hot cakes\", to describe a product which seems to have inexhaustible demand. Things which are jin\u0127ar\u0121u b\u0127all-pastizzi, coming out like pastizzi, can be said to be emerging at a fast rate, sometimes too quickly.\nMaltese cuisine\nList of Maltese dishes\n\"#1 Pastizzi.com\".

Kolomna claims to be the birthplace of original \"white-foam\" pastila and maintains a museum and a museum factory dedicated to history and traditions of pastila production. The museum occupies a merchant house dating from ca. 1800, while the museum factory is located in a historical factory building. Rzhev and Belyov used to be known as other important centres of production. Kolomna pastila has been hand-made from apples for more than three hundred years. The process included whipping apple puree with egg whites and drying the paste in a stove. The finished product could be stored for many years. In 1735 the first pastila factory (pastilnaya) was set up. The pastila recipes and the product itself were forgotten after the Russian Revolution.\nIn 2008, during the European skating championship in Kolomna, the project \"History with flavor\" was implemented, which resulted in the revival of the Kolomna pastila production process. The forsaken symbol of Kolomna was regained with the opening of the pastila factory and the museum that followed.\nThe museum was set up in a historical building in the old part of the city. In the building next to it one can find the factory itself. During the theatrical performance that accompanies excursion, visitors are offered a number of unique sorts of pastila. There is also another museum where tourists can both listen to the story of pastila and buy a box of the dessert.\nList of Russian desserts\nPestil\nVera Broido.

It receives its name from the cazuela (Spanish for cooking pot) - traditionally, often shallow and of unglazed earthenware - in which it is cooked. The ingredients and preparation vary from region to region, but it is usually a mid-thick flavoured stock obtained from cooking several kinds of meats and vegetables mixed together.",

The cazuela is a typical dish of Chile. The most common types are made of chicken or beef, but there are also other types made from pork, lamb and turkey.\nOne of the most important facts about Chilean cazuela is that it is made by cooking all the ingredients separately and uniting them when serving in the plate. A typical dish of Chilean cazuela is made by boiling the meat (normally beef or chicken) with chopped onions and carrots. All the rest of the ingredients are boiled separate in individual pots, but the stock from the meat is complemented with the stock from the boiling of the vegetables; the plate is served accompanied of a piece of squash or zapallo camote in Spanish, one big potato or a couple of small potatoes, green beans, previously cooked rice and a piece of sweetcorn. Its normally topped with a bit of fresh coriander, parsley or aj\u00ed verde.\nThe cazuela is typically eaten by consuming the liquid stock first, then eating the meat and larger vegetables (e.g. potatoes, large piece of squash or carrot) last. However, the meat and larger vegetables can also be sliced up within the liquid stock and can be eaten simultaneously with the liquid stock. Normally the leftovers are chopped, mixed with green peas and made into another stew called carbonada.\nThe Chilean cazuela  shares roots with a Mapuche stock called \"korr\u00fc\".\nCazuela is a typical dish of the Amazonas region in Peru. The dish is prepared and cooked differently in each province or district of Amazonas.\nIn Chachapoyas, cazuela is prepared by boiling a piece of hen, a good piece of meat and a good piece of sheep. Add some wild cabbage, rice, carrot, sweetcorn grains, and a glass of white wine.\nA few minutes before taking the saucepot out of the fire, add some milk and vermicelli noodles (also called cabello de \u00e1ngel noodles). It is necessary to try that the cazuela has sufficient broth or juice to be able to be served as a soup.\nIn Puerto Rico, cazuela is a traditional crustless pie cooked in banana leaves usually made during the Christmas season. It is similar to a pumpkin pie but uses batata (a type of sweet potato), calabasa (Caribbean squash), raisins, ginger, spices, coconut milk, eggs, butter, and bread, flour or rice flour. There are recipes with added sweet plantain, taro, or yuca with baking powder and lard.\nIn southern Arizona, cazuela (sometimes spelled casuela) is generally made with carne seca or machaca (two varieties of dried beef) with potatoes, garlic, green chiles, and herbs.\nList of soups\nSonia Montecino Aguirre. \"Cocinas mestizas de Chile.

Hojuelas are usually made with wheat flour, eggs, water, and half a cup of orange juice or less. Strips of the batter are then fried with vegetable oil.\nIn Chile, hojuelas derive from a traditional recipe using palm syrup.\n\"Miel sobre hojuelas\" is a Spanish saying analogous to the English expression \"Icing on the cake\". Supposedly, the expression emerged when people added honey over hojuelas rather than sugar, and enjoyed the taste even more. It means something akin to making something good even better.\nAlternatively, saying \"No todo es miel sobre hojuelas, or \"Not everything is honeyed hojuelas\", means \"It is not all fun and games\".\nJuan Salanova.

Chai tow kway (Min Nan Chinese: chh\u00e0i-th\u00e2u-ko\u00e9) is a common dish or dim sum of Teochew cuisine in Chaoshan, China. It is also popular in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam, consisting of stir-fried cubes of radish cake.\nIt is also known as \"fried carrot cake\" or simply \"carrot cake\" in Southeast Asian countries, as the word for daikon (POJ: chh\u00e0i-th\u00e2u), one of its main ingredients, can also refer to a carrot (POJ: \u00e2ng-chh\u00e0i-th\u00e2u, literally \"red radish\"). There is no connection between this dish and the sweet Western carrot cake. It is called \"carrot cake\" because of a loose English from Hokkien translation of \"radish pastry\" is called \"chai tow (carrot or radish) kway (cake)\", which caught on among the non-native speaking diners, due to its unique misnomer. This misnomer gave the title to a popular guidebook on Singapore's street food, There's No Carrot in Carrot Cake, which was written by Dr. Olivia Law, published by Epigram Books in 2010.\nThe versions served by hawkers in Johor and Singapore, where Teochews live, are typically prepared by frying the daikon cake with chopped preserved turnip, diced garlic, eggs, and Chinese fish sauce in place of soya sauce. Chopped spring onion is added just before serving. Northwards (e.g. in Kuala Lumpur), the same dish is darker due to the use of dark soya sauce, and bean sprouts are added. The \"black version\" mentioned below is not \"chai tow kway\", but \"char kway\" and uses rice cake fried with garlic (usually no preserved daikon), bean sprouts, eggs and thick sweet dark sauce.\nIn Singapore, however, it is more commonly cut into pieces and stir fried with eggs, garlic, spring onion and occasionally shrimp (both dried and fresh). There are two variants: the \"white\" version does not use sweet soy sauce, and the carrot cake is fried on top of a beaten egg to form a crust; the \"black\" version uses sweet sauce (molasses) and the egg is simply mixed in with the carrot cake.\nThe dish is very popular particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, where it is enjoyed by people of different dialect groups and races, and not just the Teochews, and is served in a range of establishments ranging from the simplest hawkers to the most expensive Chinese restaurants. It is a much-loved local comfort food in the region, and can be consumed at various times of the day; it goes from being a breakfast dish, to a side dish, to a late-night supper dish. Many public figures are also known to have a fondness for the dish. Notably, the Singapore politician Chan Chun Sing has indicated his love for the dish in one of his speeches, indicating a preference of a particular variant of the dish (specifically the \"S$10 XO Sauce chye tow kuay\"), as opposed to the one commonly found in hawker centres and coffee shops, thus illustrating the many variations of the dish available in the region.\nCarrot cake\nList of carrot dishes\nTurnip cake, a similar variety of Cantonese dim sum, using the same lobak (more commonly known as daikon) and rice flour\nB\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t chi\u00ean\nKowtani, Monica (16 Jan 2012). \"Pay not a primary factor for PAP team: Chan Chun Sing\".

                "description": "Guacamole is traditionally made by mashing peeled, ripe avocados and sea salt with a molcajete y tejolote (mortar and pestle). Recipes often call for lime juice, cilantro, onions, and jalapeos. Some non-traditional recipes may call for sour cream, tomatoes, basil, or peas. Due to the presence of polyphenol oxidase in the cells of avocado, exposure to oxygen in the air causes an enzymatic reaction and develops melanoidin pigment, turning the sauce brown. This result is generally considered unappetizing, and there are several methods (some anecdotal) that are used to counter this effect, such as storing the guacamole in an air-tight container or wrapping tightly in plastic to limit the surface area exposed to the air.",

Guacamole (Spanish:\u00a0[(\u0261)waka\u02c8mole] (listen); (informally shortened to guac in the United States since the 1980s) is an avocado-based dip, spread, or salad first developed in Mexico. In addition to its use in modern Mexican cuisine, it has become part of international and American cuisine as a dip, condiment and salad ingredient.\nThe name comes from Classical Nahuatl \u0101huacam\u014dlli [a\u02d0waka\u02c8mo\u02d0l\u02d0i], which literally translates to 'avocado sauce', from \u0101huacatl [a\u02d0\u02c8wakat\u0361\u026c] 'avocado' + m\u014dlli [\u02c8mo\u02d0l\u02d0i] 'sauce'. In Mexican Spanish, it is pronounced [waka\u02c8mole], in American English, it tends to be pronounced /\u02cc\u0261w\u0251\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8mo\u028ali\u02d0/, and in British English, /\u02cc\u0261w\u0251\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8mo\u028ale\u026a/.\nAvocados were first cultivated in South Central Mexico around 10,000 years ago. In the early 1900s, avocados frequently went by the name alligator pear.  In the 1697 book, A New Voyage Round the World, the first known description of a guacamole recipe (though not known by that name) was by English privateer and naturalist William Dampier, who in his visit to Central America during one of his circumnavigations, noted a native preparation made of grinding together avocados, sugar, and lime juice.\nGuacamole has increased avocado sales in the U.S., especially on Super Bowl Sunday and Cinco de Mayo. The rising consumption of guacamole is most likely due to the U.S. government lifting a ban on avocado imports in the 1990s and the growth of the U.S. Latino population.\nAs the major ingredient of guacamole is raw avocado, the nutritional value of the dish derives from avocado vitamins, minerals and fats, providing dietary fiber, several B vitamins, vitamin K, vitamin E and potassium in significant content (see Daily Value percentages in nutrient table for avocado). Avocados are a source of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and phytosterols, such as beta-sitosterol. They also contain carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, zeaxanthin and lutein.\n\nMantequilla de pobre (Spanish for '\"poor-man's butter\"') is a mixture of avocado, tomato, oil, and citrus juice. Despite its name, it predates the arrival of dairy cattle in the Americas, and thus was not originally made as a butter substitute.\nThinner and more acidic, or thick and chunky, guasacaca is a Venezuelan avocado-based sauce; it is made with vinegar, and is served over parrillas (grilled food), arepas, empanadas, and various other dishes. It is common to make the guasacaca with a little hot sauce instead of jalape\u00f1o, but like a guacamole, it is not usually served as a hot sauce itself. Pronounced \"wasakaka\" in Latin America.\nPrepared guacamoles are available in stores, often available refrigerated, frozen or in high pressure packaging which pasteurizes and extends shelf life if products are maintained at 1 to 4\u00a0\u00b0C (34 to 40\u00a0\u00b0F).\nNational Guacamole Day is celebrated on the same day as Mexican Independence Day, September 16.\nOn April 6, 2018, Junta Local de Sanidad Vegetal de Tanc\u00edtaro, Mexico, achieved the Guinness World Records for the largest serving of guacamole. They created it as part of Tanc\u00edtaro's 7th Annual Avocado Festival in Tanc\u00edtaro, Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. The serving weighed 3,788\u00a0kg (8,351 lb) and had more than 350 people help prepare it.\nAvocado sauce\nList of avocado dishes\nList of dips\nList of condiments\nList of Mexican dishes\nMole sauce\nSalsa (sauce)\n\"Oxford Dictionary\".

Parkin is traditionally eaten on Guy Fawkes Night, 5 November,  but is also enjoyed throughout the winter months. It is baked commercially throughout Yorkshire, but is mainly a domestic product in other areas.\nThe origin of the word parkin is unknown. The first published dated reference to parkin was collected from 1728 from the West Yorkshire Quarter Sessions when Anne Whittaker was accused of stealing oatmeal to make parkin. The Lancashire schoolmaster and poet Tim Bobbin describes tharf cake in 1740, and this is recognisable as a parkin. A possible older use of parkin is in the seventeenth century ballad  'The song of Arthur O'Bradley'  that purports to describe a merry wedding from the time of Robin Hood (fourteenth century)\nWhen Arthur, to make their hearts merry\n\nBrought ales and parkin and perry.\nThe tharf cake is of ancient Teutonic origin, as tharf or theorf meant 'unleavened, un-fermented, solid tough or sodden' in Old English. John Wycliffe in his translation of the Bible in 1389 (Mark Ch.14.v. 1) calls unleavened bread a \"tharf loove\"\nParkin is virtually unknown in the south of England. It is eaten in an area where oats were the staple grain for the poor, rather than wheat. It is closely related to tharf cake \u2013 an unsweetened cake cooked on a griddle rather than baked. The traditional time of the year for tharf cakes to be made  was directly after the oat harvest in the first week in November. For festive occasions, the cake would be sweetened with honey. In the seventeenth century (about 1650) sugar started to be imported from Barbados, and molasses was a by-product of the refining process. Molasses was first used by apothecaries; to make a medicine theriaca, from which name the word treacle is derived. As molasses became plentiful, or treacle as it became called at that time, it was substituted for honey in the preparation of tharf cakes.\nIn Northern Europe honey was used as a medicine, for festive cakes and making mead; before 1750 sweetness was not a characteristic of everyday food. Honey cakes had a special festive significance. They were baked to be hard, but after storage for a couple of weeks they regained their moisture becoming soft and even sticky. Molasses has hygroscopic properties. German Lebkuchen and Pfefferkuchen were other examples of hygroscopic holiday ginger-breads. They too were baked hard in summer and allowed to moisten for consumption at Christmas.\nThough parkin and tharf cake appear to be synonymous, all parkins generally were sweet tharf cakes.\nParkin and tharf cake were used interchangeably in Lancashire and South Yorkshire until 1900. Over the 500 years the recipe and taste of these cakes have changed considerably.  It was the food of the poor. Ovens were rare in the houses of the poor, and they generally had no access to public bakers before the 1820s, so the cakes were cooked on griddles or bakestones on an open fire. The best parkin was made with fresh oatmeal, which fixes the date around the first week in November.\nIn southern Lancashire and West Yorkshire, parkin is inextricably linked to the Guy Fawkes Night celebration. Jennifer Stead, in her study Prodigal Frugality, identifies the link between Guy Fawkes and parkin as the bonfire. The first two weeks in November had many Christian festivals, and like Celtic festivals that preceded them they were celebrated with a fire and ritual cakes. November starts with All Hallows Eve, that runs into All Saints Day (1 November), which is followed by All Souls Day (2 November).  Little Lent and the forty-day fast until Christmas, started at Martinmas. (11 November). On All Souls Day soul cakes were baked. The Martinmas fair was important being the traditional day when cattle were bought and sold, and servants were hired for the following year. It was also the date that cattle were slaughtered and salted to preserve them for the winter and for general feasting and dancing.\nThe Celtic festival of Samain, the festival of the dead on 1 November, was celebrated with special cakes and bonfires. It was Christianised into All Hallows by the church in 837 A.D., and the culinary tradition continued. When Guy Fawkes in 1605 gave the English church a reason to celebrate with a bonfire, the tradition was adopted under the new name, just four days later on 5 November.

Khinkali is typically consumed first by sucking the juices while taking the first bite, similar to xiaolongbao, in order to prevent the dumpling from bursting.

Green bean casserole is a baked dish consisting primarily of green beans, cream of mushroom soup, and french fried onions. The recipe was created in 1955 by Dorcas Reilly at the Campbell Soup Company. It is a very popular side dish for Thanksgiving dinners in the United States and has been described as iconic. As of 2020 Campbell's estimated it was served in 20 million Thanksgiving dinners in the US each year and that 40% of the company's cream of mushroom soup sales go into a version of the dish.\nCampbell\u2019s Cream of Mushroom flavored soup variety was created in 1934 and was the first of the company's soups to be marketed as a sauce as well as a soup. It became so widely used as casserole filler in recipes for the hotdish recipes popular in Minnesota that it was sometimes referred to as \"Lutheran binder.\" Like other food companies, Campbell's employed recipe developers to create recipes using their products as part of their marketing strategy.\nDorcas Reilly (1926\u20132018) created the recipe in 1955 while working in the home economics department at the Campbell's Soup Company. The recipe was created for a feature article for the Associated Press; the requirement was for a quick and easy dish using ingredients most US households kept on hand. \nIt was called \"Green Bean Bake\" when the recipe began being printed on soup cans. Initially the dish did not test well within the company but, in part because of Reilly's persistence, eventually earned a reputation for being \"the ultimate comfort food.\" Culinary historian Laura Shapiro called the recipe's use of the crunch fried onion topping was a \"touch of genius\" that gave an otherwise ordinary convenience-food side dish a bit of \"glamour\".\nFood & Wine called it iconic, and Good Housekeeping said that \"few dishes are as iconic\" as the green bean casserole.\nIt was originally marketed as an everyday side dish but became popular for Thanksgiving dinners in the 1960s after Campbell's placed the recipe on the can's label. The recipe popularized the combination of the soup with green beans. Campbell's Soup now estimates that 40 percent of the Cream of Mushroom soup sold in the United States goes into making green bean casserole. As of 2020 Campbell's estimated it was served in 20 million Thanksgiving dinners in the US each year. Campbell's in 2020 reported their online version of the recipe is viewed 4 million times each Thanksgiving Day. According to Campbell's as of 2018, the recipe is the most popular ever developed in their kitchens. Campbell's has estimated that 40% of its cream of mushroom soup sales become ingredients in a green bean casserole. \nFolklorist Lucy Long in 2007 noted that its inclusion on Thanksgiving dinner tables crosses ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious differences. She also notes it is included in most popular American cookbooks, mentioned in the media regularly, and referred to a \"classic\", \"traditional\", and \"a Thanksgiving standard\". She wrote that the popularity of the dish was related to its categorization as a casserole, which in the US is associated with \"communal eating, sharing, and generosity\" and that the green bean casserole in particular represents the familiar and also the festive.\nIn November of 2002, Reilly, representing Campbell's, donated the original recipe card to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio. The donation was followed by a meal featuring the dish. Reilly died 15 October 2018, at the age of 92 in her hometown of Camden, New Jersey.\nList of casserole dishes\nMarketing\nLong, Lucy (Spring 2007). \"Green Bean Casserole: The Logic of a Midwestern Foodways Aesthetic\".

Aush means \"thick soup\" in Iranian languages.\nThe word \"cook\" translates to \"Aushpaz\" (\u0622\u0634\u067e\u0632) in Persian.

The Afghan version of the soup is more likely to have tomatoes or a tomato broth. It is topped with chaka (yogurt sauce), fried garlic, and dried/crushed mint leaves.\nThere are more than 50 types of thick soup (\u0101sh) in Iranian cooking, ash reshteh being one of the more popular types; using reshteh.

Imoni (\u828b\u716e) is a type of taro and meat soup eaten traditionally in the autumn in the T\u014dhoku region of Japan. Yamagata Prefecture in particular is famous for its imoni, but other prefectures in the region also have their own different varieties.\nImoni is eaten like any soup, primarily during the late summer and early autumn, but is most famous as an outdoor food. In the autumn, groups of people preparing imoni around a fire near a river is considered a sign of the season, and convenience stores maintain a stock of firewood and other supplies just for the occasion.\nIn Yamagata Prefecture in particular, and its neighbours in general, imonikai (\u828b\u716e\u4f1a \"imoni parties\") are an important autumn tradition. Tourists flock to Yamagata for the Autumn Imoni Festival (Akino Imonikai) where they join local residents on the banks of the Mamigasaki River on the first Sunday in September, to eat imoni from a gigantic iron kettle, which uses a building crane to add ingredients and stir the pot. In 2009 the festival served imoni to 30,000 guests before the pot was empty.\nMany schools and work organisations in Northern Japan arrange imonikai for their students or employees. Through September and October it is common to see groups of imonikai revellers on the banks of rivers, even near major highways.\nList of Japanese soups and stews\nNabemono\nJapanese regional cuisine\nList of Japanese dishes\nJNTO Website | Find a Location | Yamagata | Yamagata City and its surroundings",

The name Isku-dheh karis literally means \"cooked mixed together\", therefore it is sometimes used to more broadly refer to other grain-derived crops that require similar cooking. Hence the more specific term for this dish is bariis isku-dheh karis which means \"rice (bariis) cooked mixed together\".\nThe dish incorporates a spice mixture called xawaash which literally translates as \"spices\" in the Somali Language and which is made from a mixture of ground cumin, turmeric, coriander, paprika, cardamon, black pepper, cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Either saffron or orange or red food coloring are added to the dish after the rice has finished cooking to give the dish an orange color.\nBariis iskukaris can be served with various meats including chicken, mutton, fish or camel meat. Some Somali restaurants serve it with a banana. This rice dish is often served from a clay pot called baris dhari, which serves to impart flavor from food cooked in metal pots.\nBariis and meat dishes served with it are considered Halal and as such are suitable for consumption by Muslims.  It is extremely popular with Muslims in Somalia.\n\nMoju, Kiano (2018-06-01). \"Somali Bariis By Amal Dalmar Recipe by Tasty\". tasty.co.

The exact provenance of the word is often contested, but, like the names of many Maghrebi dishes and terms, is believed to come from the language of the Amazigh (or Berber) people indigenous to the region.\nThe origin of the dish remains a matter of some controversy with competing claims of Libyan, Moroccan, Tunisian, Turkish, and Yemeni origins. Tomatoes and peppers are notably New World ingredients that only became common ingredients in later centuries after the Columbian exchange. \nThe dish has also been part of Sephardic cuisine for centuries, and was brought to Israel by Jewish immigrants from Libya and Tunisia in the 1950s and 1960s, though it only became popularised on menus in the 1990s. Much of its current popularity in Israel is due to Bino Gabso, the son of Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Tripoli, who in 1991 took over his father's restaurant in Jaffa and changed its name to Dr Shakshuka. \nThe dish has since been globally popularised, a trend that may in part have been helped by the 2012 cookbook on Jerusalem cuisine by Jewish Israeli chef Yotam Ottolenghi and his Palestinian business partner Sami Tamimi. Israeli food writer Gil Hovav, has credited the international popularity of dishes like shakshouka to Ottolenghi and Tamimi's book. Some have accused Israel of cultural appropriation which chef Michael Solomonov dismissed: \"To say that this is stolen food \u2013 not only is it inaccurate, it\u2019s just lazy. The real reason that everybody in that region cooks the way they do is because of the Ottomans.\"\nMany variations of the basic sauce are possible, varying in spice and sweetness. Some cooks add preserved lemon, salty sheep milk cheeses, olives, harissa or a spicy sausage such as chorizo or merguez. Shakshouka is made with eggs which are commonly poached but can also be scrambled like the Turkish menemen.\nSome variations of shakshouka can be made with lamb mince, toasted whole spices, yogurt and fresh herbs. Spices can include ground coriander, caraway, paprika, cumin and cayenne pepper. Tunisian cooks may add potatoes, broad beans, artichoke hearts or courgettes to the dish. The North African dish matbukha can be used as a base for shakshouka. \nA shakhsouka made with a kosher version of Spam (called loof) was added to IDF army rations in the 1950s. Because eggs are the main ingredient, it is often on breakfast menus in English-speaking countries, but in the Arab world as well as Israel, it is also a popular evening meal, and like hummus and falafel, is a Levantine regional favorite. On the side, pickled vegetables and North African sausage called merguez might be served, or simply bread, with mint tea.\nIn Jewish culture, a large batch of tomato stew is made for the Sabbath dinner and the leftovers used the following morning to make a breakfast shakshouka with eggs. In Andalusian cuisine, the dish is known as huevos a la flamenca; this version includes chorizo and serrano ham. in Italian cuisine, there is a version of this dish called uova in purgatorio (eggs in purgatory) with tomato paste, anchovy, garlic and parsley and sometimes parmesan cheese.\nList of Middle Eastern dishes\nGalayet bandora\nHuevos rancheros\nLecs\u00f3\nNathan, Joan (2017).

Portuguese versions may use espresso, lemon, mint and rum, and Austrian versions are served with an ice cube and include rum.

It has been stated that the drink's name probably originated from a fortress named Mazagran in Algiers, Algeria which in 1837 through the Treaty of Tafna was granted to France.  At the Mazagran fortress French colonial troops consumed the beverage, which was prepared with coffee syrup and cold water. It has also been stated that the drink's name and invention may have originated from French Foreign Legion soldiers who, during the time of the siege of Mazagran, Algeria during the 1840 war,  used water in their coffee in the absence of milk or brandy and drank the beverage cold to counter the heat. Furthermore, French colonial troops near Mazagran were served a beverage prepared with coffee syrup and water. When the soldiers returned to Paris, they suggested to caf\u00e9s to serve the beverage and the notion of it being served in tall glasses. Upon this introduction, the beverage was named caf\u00e9 mazagran. In France, coffee served in glasses is referred to as \"mazagrin\".\nMazagran is prepared with strong, hot coffee that is poured over ice, and it is typically served in a narrow, tall glass. It has also been described as \"coffee taken with water instead of milk\", in which coffee is served in a tall glass along with a separate container of water to mix in with the coffee.\nThe beverage has also been described as sweetened \"Portuguese iced coffee\" that is prepared with strong coffee or espresso served over ice with lemon. Sometimes rum is added to Portuguese versions of the drink, and it may be sweetened with sugar syrup.\nIn Austria, mazagran coffee is served with an ice cube and prepared with rum. The beverage is typically downed \"in one gulp\".\nIn Catalonia and Valencia, it is made with coffee added to ice, and a lemon peel. It is called \"Caf\u00e9 del temps\" (Cat.), \"caf\u00e9 del tiempo\" (Spa.), or \"weather's coffe\". \nIn the mid 1990s, Starbucks and PepsiCo developed a line of flavored carbonated mazagran beverages named \"Mazagran\" that were prepared with coffee. After a short trial run in California in 1994, the drink was discontinued after failing to catch on with consumers. A useful new by-product of Starbucks' research and development  of mazagran was a coffee extract that could be used in various coffee-flavored products. The coffee extract was later used in the preparation of pre-mixed, bottled Starbucks' frappuccino drinks that are sold in grocery stores.

Though tepache is fermented for several days, the resulting drink does not contain much alcohol. In Mexican culinary practice, the alcoholic content of tepache may be increased with a small amount of beer. In Mexico, tepache is usually sold as a chilled drink by street vendors. It is usually stored in barrels to make the fermentation process faster. It is served either in a clay mug or in a clear plastic bag with a straw inserted for easier travel. ...",

Tepache dates from Pre-Columbian Mexico, as a popular drink among the Nahua people of central Mexico; in the Nahuatl (also known as Aztec) language, the word tepi\u0101tl means \"drink made from corn\". Originally, corn (maize) was the base of tepache, but the contemporary recipe for tepache uses pineapple rinds as the foodstuff fermented to produce the tart drink that is tepache. Some varieties of tepache, known as tepache de tibicos, are fermented using symbiotic cultures of tibicos.\nBecause of the popularity of tepache in Mexico, the drink is now being produced commercially as a non-alcoholic drink. There are a few different brands of tepache including Tepache from the Frumex Corporation.\nThe original Frumex Tepache contained 12% juice and was made from fermented skins and pulp along with some sugar, spices, and barley. That version was replaced with a newer version that contained only 10% juice and no barley. That one was made from only fermented pineapple juice, no skins or pulp. The latest version, now rebranded as Tepachito, still contains only 10% juice but it is made from fermented juice and skin, no barley. It does include white and brown sugar and spices.\nThe drink tepache is mentioned in the popular Spanish-language quebradita song \"La Ni\u00f1a Fresa\" (\"The Spoiled Girl\"), by Banda Zeta, in which the spoiled-girl character is offered several types of drink\u2014including tepache\u2014yet she refuses them all, for being beneath her social status.\nIndigenous cuisine\nTejuino\nPulque\nChicha de pi\u00f1a\n\"Tepache\u2014Easy, Delicious, and Healthful!\".

Traditional Cuban-style coffee is made using the darker roasts, typically either Italian or Spanish roasts, with the brands Cafe Bustelo, Cafe La Llave and Cafe Pil\u00f3n being popular. It can be made using an electric espresso machine, but is commonly made with a moka pot.\nEither some or all of the espresso is vigorously mixed with a spoon into a creamy foam called espuma or espumita. The heat from the coffee-making process will hydrolyze some of the sucrose, thereby creating a sweeter and slightly more viscous result than a normal pull or adding sugar at the table.\nCortadito is a standard espresso shot topped off with steamed milk. The ratio can be between 50/50 and 75/25 espresso and milk. It is similar to a cortado served in other Latin countries, but pre-sweetened.\nCaf\u00e9 con leche, or \"coffee with milk\", is an espresso served alongside a cup of hot or steamed milk. Traditionally served separate from the coffee, the espresso is poured to the desired darkness into the cup of hot milk and then stirred. It is the traditional Cuban breakfast beverage, served with slices of buttered, toasted cuban bread.\nColada is 3\u20136 shots of Cuban-style espresso served in a Styrofoam cup along with small, plastic demitasses. It is a takeaway form, meant to be drunk as one shot. This is customary of workplace breaks in Cuban communities.\nCoffee production in Cuba\nDalgona coffee\nList of coffee drinks\nList of hot beverages\nVietnamese iced coffee\n\"How to Make Cuban Coffee - Cafe Cubano Recipe | MokaBees\".

Teh tarik (literally \"pulled tea\") is a popular hot milk tea beverage most commonly found in restaurants, outdoor stalls, mamaks and kopitiams within the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. Its name is derived from the pouring process of \"pulling\" the drink during preparation. It is made from a strong brew of black tea blended with condensed milk. It is the national drink of Malaysia.\nTeh tarik is formed by two languages: \"Teh\" which means \"tea\" and \"tarik\" which means \"pulled\". The word \"Teh\" for tea originates from Hokkien word \u8336 t\u00ea for tea, the word \"Tarik\" for pulled originates from Malay.\nThe origins of teh tarik can be traced to Indian Muslim immigrants in the Malay Peninsula who set up drink stalls at the entrance of rubber plantations after World War II to serve the workers there. Since colonial times, teh tarik has been a popular Malaysian Indian cuisine for many in British Malaya and Singapore. Traditionally, teh tarik has been seen served with the Roti canai which is a popular breakfast set among Malaysians.\nAn element of showmanship exists in the preparation of teh tarik. The ability to drag a long stream of tea above the heads of the patrons without giving them a shower is an amusing novelty for the locals and tourists alike. In Malaysia, there are occasions where teh tarik brewers gather for competitions and performances to show their skills. Teh tarik has become recognised along with nasi lemak as part of the food and beverage heritage of Malaysia by the Malaysian government ministry.\nTeh Ais is tea sweetened with condensed milk that is simply served in a glass with ice cubes. It may also be known as Teh Tarik Ping or Teh Tarik Ais with the tarik treatment.\nTeh Tarik Madu is teh tarik blended with honey as part of its preparation, which is usually served cold.\nTeh halia, teh tarik flavoured with ginger.\nTeh Madras, a variant popular in Sabah and Labuan, is made with frothed milky tea layered on top of hot milk.\nTeh-C is tea made with unsweetened evaporated milk, unlike the traditional teh tarik which is made with sweetened condensed milk. Vendors however will add sugar to Teh-C unless specifically asked not to. The Malay word for nil or zero, kosong, is used to indicate that the drinker does not want their beverage to be sweetened. The \u2018C\u2019 stands for \u2018Carnation\u2019, a popular brand of evaporated milk. A three layered tea variation of the drink called Teh C Peng Special are available and sold in most kopitiams, consisting of black tea, milk and palm sugar syrup from the top to bottom layer respectively. Teh C' Ais is the iced drink version of it with ice cubes.\nTeh-O refers to black tea without any addition of dairy products or creamers entirely, hence the \u2018O\u2019 stands for \"original\". Like Teh-C, sugar is usually added except when Teh-O kosong is specified, where once again sugar is omitted. Teh O' Ais is the iced drink version of it with ice cubes.\nKopi Tarik is local coffee, dark roasted with margarine and sugar, which is sweetened with condensed milk and pulled to froth it up. Drinks made with Milo and Nescafe may also be served with the tarik treatment by vendors which specialise in teh tarik.\nThai Tea\nHong Kong-style Milk Tea\nBubble Tea\nMasala Chai\nBonny Tan (2013). \"Teh tarik\".

The term \"Americano\" means \"American\", and derives from American Spanish, dating to the 1970s, or from Italy. The term \"caff\u00e8 Americano\" specifically is Italian for \"American coffee\". There is a popular, but unconfirmed, belief that the name has its origins in World War II when American G.I.s in Italy would dilute espresso with hot water to approximate the coffee to which they were accustomed. \nEarlier, in his 1928 novel Ashenden: Or the British Agent, Somerset Maugham has his protagonist order and drink something called an americano  in Naples during World War I, but there is not enough information to indicate whether it is the same drink.\nAnd in Maugham's short story \"The Wash-Tub\" from 1929, taking place in Positano, near Naples, \"americano\" appears again. The narrator states, \"I asked what there was for dinner and drank an americano, which is by no means a bad substitute for a cocktail\".\nThe drink consists of a single or double shot of espresso brewed with added water. Typically in the UK (and in Italy) between 1 and 16 imperial fluid ounces or 28 and 455\u00a0ml of hot water is added to the double espresso.\nLong Black is an Australasian term for a drink similar to the Americano (in contrast to Short Black for espresso), with an emphasis being placed on the order of preparation, adding water to the cup first before pouring the espresso on top.\nThe term Italiano is sometimes used in the Western United States, meaning a short Americano, specifically a 1:1 espresso/water ratio.\nThe hot water can be drawn directly from the same espresso machine that is used to brew the espresso, or from a separate water heater or kettle. Using the same heater is convenient, particularly at home, not needing a separate heater, and the water can in fact be drawn directly into the glass, either before (for a Long Black) or after (for an Americano) pulling the shot of espresso. Some espresso machines have a separate hot water spout for this purpose, while others allow the use of the steam wand for dispensing hot water. Using a separate water heater is more practical in a commercial setting, as it reduces the demands on the espresso machine, both not disrupting the temperature of the brew water and allowing an inexpensive water heater to be used for hot water, rather than the substantially more complicated espresso machine.\nMost commonly, an Americano is used when one orders a brew-coffee sized drink from an espresso bar.\nAmericanos\u2014particularly short, long-black-style Americanos\u2014are also used within artisanal espresso preparation for beans that produce strong espresso. This is particularly used for single origin espresso, where many find that undiluted espresso shots can prove overpowering; and with lighter coffees and roasts not generally associated with espresso, such as beans of Ethiopian or Sumatran origins. For this preparation, generally a ratio of 1:1 espresso to water is used, to prevent excess dilution, with the espresso pulled directly into a cup with existing water to minimize disruption to the crema.\nThe iced americano is made by combining espresso with cold water instead of hot water. A lungo is made by extracting an espresso shot for longer giving more volume, but also extracting some bitter flavours. A caff\u00e8 crema is also made by extracting an espresso shot significantly longer than a lungo. A red eye is made with drip coffee instead of hot water, and may be called a shot in the dark.\nIn 2016, the Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev humorously proposed for the coffee style to be 'renamed' to Russiano following deterioration of relations with the United States. The proposal, though humorous, had its implementation in one of Moscow's caf\u00e9s.\nList of coffee drinks\nLong black\n\"Americano\". Oxford Dictionary of English. 2013.

Mango sticky rice is a traditional Southeast Asian and South Asian dessert made with glutinous rice, fresh mango and coconut milk, and eaten with a spoon or the hands.\nThese are variations to the classic mango sticky rice, such as substituting white sticky rice with black sticky rice, imparting a purple color.\nIn Thailand, mango sticky rice is usually eaten during the peak mango season of April and May. Common sweet mango cultivars, such as nam dawk mai or ok long, are combined with glutinous rice sweetened with coconut milk, and served warm.\nMango sticky rice is a common dessert of the Lao people of the Greater Mekong Sub-region where glutinous rice has been cultivated over the history of food and myths. Sticky or glutinous rice is a Laos national dish connected to the culture and religious traditions.\nA sticky rice snack cooked in coconut milk, and sometimes, ginger called puto maya is a favorite among the Visayan people. It is served with sweet ripe mangoes (if in season) and a hot chocolate. In Cagayan de Oro, a violet variety of sticky rice is used.\n\"What Is Mango Sticky Rice?\". wiseGEEK.

Caf\u00e9 Cubano (also known as  Cuban espresso, Colada, Cuban coffee, cafecito, Cuban pull, and Cuban shot) is a type of espresso that originated in Cuba. Specifically, it refers to an espresso shot which is sweetened (traditionally with natural brown sugar which has been whipped with the first and strongest drops of espresso). However, the name is sometimes used to refer to coffee-based drinks that include Cuban espresso as the main ingredient, such as caf\u00e9 con leche.\nDrinking caf\u00e9 cubano remains a prominent social and cultural activity in Cuba and in Cuban-American communities, particularly in Miami, Tampa and the Florida Keys.\nCortadito is a standard espresso shot topped off with steamed milk. The ratio can be between 50/50 and 75/25 espresso and milk. It is similar to a cortado served in other Latin countries, but pre-sweetened.\nCaf\u00e9 con leche, or \"coffee with milk\", is an espresso served alongside a cup of hot or steamed milk. Traditionally served separate from the coffee, the espresso is poured to the desired darkness into the cup of hot milk and then stirred. It is the traditional Cuban breakfast beverage, served with slices of buttered, toasted cuban bread.\nColada is 3\u20136 shots of Cuban-style espresso served in a Styrofoam cup along with small, plastic demitasses. It is a takeaway form, meant to be drunk as one shot. This is customary of workplace breaks in Cuban communities.\nCoffee production in Cuba\nDalgona coffee\nList of coffee drinks\nList of hot beverages\nVietnamese iced coffee\n\"How to Make Cuban Coffee - Cafe Cubano Recipe | MokaBees\".

However, during World War I, the Battle of Li\u00e8ge took place, which lasted much longer than the German army had anticipated it would, caused a delay in German advances towards France in 1914, allowing the French to reorganize better. In order to honor the city of Li\u00e8ge for its resistance, and because the city was shelled with guns from Austria (an ally of the invading Germany during the war), Paris' caf\u00e9s started renaming the dessert from caf\u00e9 viennois to caf\u00e9 li\u00e9geois.

Zigni (Tigrinya: \u12dd\u130d\u1292) or kai wat (Amharic: \u1240\u12ed \u12c8\u1325) is a popular Eritrean and Ethiopian stew (tsebhi or wat) made from meat, tomatoes, red onions and Berbere spices. The meat can be beef, lamb, goat, or chicken and usually placed on a plate of injera, a type of unleavened bread made from teff flour. It can be eaten for lunch or dinner. The dish requires a relatively long amount of time but not a lot of active effort to make. The traditional recipe can take as long as five to six hours to prepare. As such, it is sometimes reserved for special occasions. The Berbere spices can make the zigni spicy and give it a red color.\nIt is considered to be the national dish of Eritrea.\nA traditional component of Eritrean cuisine is tsebhi, which are meat stews served with injera. This is similar to Ethiopian cuisine, as the history is shared by both groups of people. However, Ethiopians use Amharic names whereas Eritreans use Tigrinya names. There are also similarities with Somali cuisine. Eritreans also tend to use less seasoned butter than the Ethiopian counterparts, making the dishes a bit lighter. The Italians colonized Eritrea which influenced the dish. For example, the use of tomatoes demonstrates the Italian influence. Cumin and curry powders reflects the Middle Eastern influence.\nIn an airtight container, zigni can be stored for three days in the refrigerator or one month in the freezer.\nThe Foreign Fork (2021-02-17). \"Zigni (Beef Stew from Eritrea)\".

The ingredients consist of shellfish, meat, potatoes, milcao (a kind of potato pancake), chapaleles (a kind of potato dumpling), and vegetables. Curanto sometimes also includes specific types of fish. The varieties of shellfish vary but almejas (clams), cholgas (ribbed mussels) and picorocos (giant barnacles) are essential. The quantities are not fixed; the idea is that there should be a little of everything. Each layer of ingredients is covered with nalca (Chilean rhubarb) leaves, or in their absence, with fig leaves or white cabbage leaves. All this is covered with wet sacks, and then with dirt and grass chunks, creating the effect of a giant pressure cooker in which the food cooks for approximately one hour.\nCuranto can also be prepared in a large stew pot that is heated over a bonfire or grill or in a pressure cooker. This stewed curanto is called \"curanto en olla\" or \"pulmay\" in the central region of Chile.\nIt is believed that this form of preparing foods was native to the \"chono\" countryside and that, with the arrival of the southern peoples and the Spanish conquistadors, new ingredients were added until it came to be the curanto that is known today.\nEarth oven\nPachamanca (Per\u00fa)\nHangi (New Zealand)\nKalua (Hawaii)\nClam bake (New England)\nRivas, Pilar; Ocampo, Carlos (2002). \"El antiguo curanto chilote\".

The term \"Americano\" means \"American\", and derives from American Spanish, dating to the 1970s, or from Italy. The term \"caff\u00e8 Americano\" specifically is Italian for \"American coffee\". There is a popular, but unconfirmed, belief that the name has its origins in World War II when American G.I.s in Italy would dilute espresso with hot water to approximate the coffee to which they were accustomed. \nEarlier, in his 1928 novel Ashenden: Or the British Agent, Somerset Maugham has his protagonist order and drink something called an americano  in Naples during World War I, but there is not enough information to indicate whether it is the same drink.\nAnd in Maugham's short story \"The Wash-Tub\" from 1929, taking place in Positano, near Naples, \"americano\" appears again. The narrator states, \"I asked what there was for dinner and drank an americano, which is by no means a bad substitute for a cocktail\".\nThe drink consists of a single or double shot of espresso brewed with added water. Typically in the UK (and in Italy) between 1 and 16 imperial fluid ounces or 28 and 455\u00a0ml of hot water is added to the double espresso.\nLong Black is an Australasian term for a drink similar to the Americano (in contrast to Short Black for espresso), with an emphasis being placed on the order of preparation, adding water to the cup first before pouring the espresso on top.\nThe term Italiano is sometimes used in the Western United States, meaning a short Americano, specifically a 1:1 espresso/water ratio.\nThe hot water can be drawn directly from the same espresso machine that is used to brew the espresso, or from a separate water heater or kettle. Using the same heater is convenient, particularly at home, not needing a separate heater, and the water can in fact be drawn directly into the glass, either before (for a Long Black) or after (for an Americano) pulling the shot of espresso. Some espresso machines have a separate hot water spout for this purpose, while others allow the use of the steam wand for dispensing hot water. Using a separate water heater is more practical in a commercial setting, as it reduces the demands on the espresso machine, both not disrupting the temperature of the brew water and allowing an inexpensive water heater to be used for hot water, rather than the substantially more complicated espresso machine.\nMost commonly, an Americano is used when one orders a brew-coffee sized drink from an espresso bar.\nAmericanos\u2014particularly short, long-black-style Americanos\u2014are also used within artisanal espresso preparation for beans that produce strong espresso. This is particularly used for single origin espresso, where many find that undiluted espresso shots can prove overpowering; and with lighter coffees and roasts not generally associated with espresso, such as beans of Ethiopian or Sumatran origins. For this preparation, generally a ratio of 1:1 espresso to water is used, to prevent excess dilution, with the espresso pulled directly into a cup with existing water to minimize disruption to the crema.\nThe iced americano is made by combining espresso with cold water instead of hot water. A lungo is made by extracting an espresso shot for longer giving more volume, but also extracting some bitter flavours. A caff\u00e8 crema is also made by extracting an espresso shot significantly longer than a lungo. A red eye is made with drip coffee instead of hot water, and may be called a shot in the dark.\nIn 2016, the Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev humorously proposed for the coffee style to be 'renamed' to Russiano following deterioration of relations with the United States. The proposal, though humorous, had its implementation in one of Moscow's caf\u00e9s.\nList of coffee drinks\nLong black\n\"Americano\". Oxford Dictionary of English. 2013.

Beurre Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel, also referred to as Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel butter, is a type of compound butter (French: \"Beurre compos\u00e9\") of French origin, prepared with butter, parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. It is a savory butter that is used on meats such as steak (including the chateaubriand sauce for chateaubriand steak), fish, vegetables and other foods. It may be used in place of a sauce, and can significantly enhance a dish's flavor. Some variations with a sweet flavor exist. It is usually served cold as sliced disks on foods, and is sometimes served as a side condiment.\nThe name of Beurre Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel is derived from the manner in which it was commonly prepared from scratch by a restaurant's ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel at diners' tables. It is also referred to as Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel butter.\nBeurre Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel is usually served cold as sliced disks atop various foods, and sometimes as a side condiment. It is used on grilled meats such as steak and fish, and also on eggs, vegetables, potatoes and breads. Some variations exist, including a few sweet versions that include sugar, which may be used on dishes such as pancakes. When used as a topping, it is typically added just before the dish is served. It has also been served melted atop dishes, whereby it is placed atop foods during the last few minutes of cooking. It may be used in the place of a sauce, and a small amount can significantly add to a dish's overall flavor.\nBeurre Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel is used as an ingredient in Chateaubriand sauce, which is sometimes used in the preparation of Chateaubriand steak. The butter is used in the last stage of the sauce's preparation, whereby after the sauce is strained, it is finished with Beurre Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel. Chopped tarragon may also be added to the sauce during this last preparation stage.\nFrench cuisine\nList of condiments\nSteak sauce\n\"Most compound butters are savory.

Roselle juice, known as bissap, wonjo, fol\u00e9r\u00e9, dabileni, tsobo, zobo, or sobolo in parts of Africa, sorrel in the Caribbean, and agua de Jamaica in Mexico, is a drink made out of the flowers of the Roselle plant, a variety of Hibiscus. Although generally the \"juice\" is sweetened and chilled, it is technically an infusion and when served hot can also be referred to as hibiscus tea.\nRoselle juice, often taken refrigerated, is a cool drink found in many West African countries and the Caribbean. It is a dark red-purple coloured juice. The Burkinabes, Senegalese,  and Ivorians call it bissap while the Ghanaians and Nigerians call it sobolo. It tastes a bit grapey and a little like cranberry juice and can be served with mint leaves. It can also be served with any flavouring of one's choice \u2014 sometimes with orange essence or ginger, pineapple juice, tea grass, vanilla, and many others. In Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal, roselle juice is served cold, while in Egypt, it is served warm.\nRoselle juice, which acts as a diuretic, has been shown to regulate blood pressure and reduce hypertension. It also has high levels of vitamin C, so is used to treat the common cold and otherwise boost the immune system. Some studies have also shown antimicrobial activity.\n\"Sobolo (Bissap Drink)\".

The dish is very popular as a side for rice in the northern regions of Sri Lanka and  the southern regions of India especially in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. In Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Ku\u1e3bambu is called pulusu. The number of varieties of Ku\u1e3bambu are countless, with each region and community of Tamil Nadu preparing it with a typical variation, adapted to its taste and environment.\nIt is a common misconception that lentils (dal) is a staple ingredient in Ku\u1e3bambu.

These types of Ku\u1e3bambu all include a base of tamarind, urad and toor dals, and spices such as curry leaves, chili, and salt.

A recipe for a shortbread cookie similar to ghorayebah but without almonds, called in Arabic khushkan\u0101naj gharib (exotic cookie), is given in the earliest known Arab cookbook, the 10th-century Kitab al-\u1e6cab\u012b\u1e2b. Kurabiye appears in the Ottoman cuisine in the 15th century.\nThere is some debate about the origin of the words. Some give no other origin for the Turkish word kurabiye than Turkish, while others have given Arabic or Persian. Among others, linguist Sevan Ni\u015fanyan has given an Arabic origin, in his 2009 book of Turkish etymology, from \u0121urayb or \u011far\u00eeb (exotic). However, as of 2019, Ni\u015fanyan's online dictionary now gives the earliest known recorded use in Turkish as the late 17th century, with an origin from the Persian gul\u0101biya, a cookie made with rose water, from gul\u0101b, related to flowers. He notes that the Syrian Arabic words \u0121ur\u0101biye/\u0121uraybiye likely derive from the Turkish.\n\nGhribia (Algerian Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0629\u200e)\nGhribia with almonds\nGhribia with peanuts\nGhribia with walnuts\nGhribia with pistachios\nKhourabia (Armenian: \u0542\u0578\u0582\u0580\u0561\u0562\u056b\u0561) is the Armenian version sometimes referred to in English as Armenian butter cookie or Armenian shortbread cookie. Khourabia was traditionally made with three ingredients: butter, sugar, and flower and usually shaped like bread, wheat ear, or horse shoe signifying health, wealth, and prosperity. It was mostly eaten during the Easter, Christmas, and New Year celebrations. Later, more ingredients were added, like eggs, cinnamon, and walnuts.\nKurabii name of the Bulgarian cuisine and the many varieties of cookie, a popular sweet variety. Especially during the holiday season, and a variety of jams produced via the new year with powdered sugar cookies decorated with cute shapes are called maslenki.\nThe Greek version, called kourabiedes or kourabiethes (Greek: \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03ad\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2) resembles a light shortbread, typically made with almonds. Kourabiedes are sometimes made with brandy, usually Metaxa, for flavouring, though vanilla, mastika or rose water are also popular. In some regions of Greece, Christmas kourabiedes are adorned with a single whole spice clove embedded in each biscuit. Kourabiedes are shaped either into crescents or balls, then baked till slightly golden. They are usually rolled in icing sugar while still hot, forming a rich butter-sugar coating. Kourabiedes are especially popular for special occasions, such as Christmas or baptisms.\nThe Greek word kourabiedes comes from the Turkish word kurabiye, which is related to qurabiya, a family of Middle Eastern cookies.\nKourabiedes are also especially popular for special occasions, such as Christmas or baptisms (christenings), though they're seen in Greece year-round.\nIn Tabriz, they are made of almond flour, sugar, egg white, vanilla, margarine and pistachio. It is served with tea, customarily placed on top of the teacup to make it soft before eating.\nVariants including:\nGhoriba with Cardamom\nGhoriba with pistachio\nGhoriba with saffron\nGhoriba with pistachio\nGhoriba with Rose water\nGhra\u00efba Libyan Arabic translation\u00a0: | \u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \nGhoriba with peanuts\nGhoriba with almonds\nGhoriba with walnuts\nGhoriba (Moroccan Arabic: \u063a\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064e\u0629) in Morocco and other parts of the Maghreb, the popular cookies often use semolina instead of white flour, giving a distinctive crunch.\nMlouwza, made with almonds and sugar flavored with orange flower water\nGhoriba bahla\nGhoriba dyal zite\nGhoriba mramla\nThe word kurabiye is used to refer to a variety of biscuits in Turkey, not necessarily local ones, although various types of local kurabiye are made; including ac\u0131badem kurabiyesi and un kurabiyesi.\nGhra\u00efba (Tunisian Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629\u200e)\nGhra\u00efba bidha, made with wheat flour\nGhra\u00efba dro\u00f4, made with sorghum flour\nGhra\u00efba homs, made with chickpea flour\nAlmond cookie\nPolvor\u00f3n\nHallongrotta\nList of almond dishes\nList of shortbread biscuits and cookies\nPanellets\n\u015eekerpare\nUn kurabiyesi\nOsmania Biscuit\n\u0130zmir Bomb Kurabiye\nKavala Almond Cookies\nMurabbal\u0131 mecidiye\nDavidson, Alan (21 August 2014).

Fatoot samneh (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05d8\u05d0\u05d5\u05d8 \u05e1\u05de\u05e0\u05d4\u200e) is a dish originating in Yemeni cuisine, consisting of pieces of saluf or malawach (Yemeni flatbreads), or pita, that have been fried in clarified butter and combined with beaten egg. It is commonly served as a breakfast or dinner dish. It was brought to Israel by Yemenite Jews. It is somewhat similar to the Jewish matzah brei or the Mexican-American migas, which are made with matzo, and corn tortillas, respectively; whereas fatoot samneh is made with pita bread.\nFatoot samneh originated as a way for the Yemenite Jewish community to use and repurpose stale pita bread that would have otherwise been discarded. The Yemenite Jewish community was historically very poor, and most of their meals consisted of various soups and stews. Bread such as pita was very valuable, as was \"samneh\", or clarified butter, and their families were often large and the women of the community traditionally had to make do and cook as many meals as possible from their limited resources to feed their families. Over time fatoot samneh became a popular, and traditional dish among the Yemenite Jews as both a way to use up stale pita bread that was past its prime, as well as a popular breakfast or dinner dish.\nFatoot samneh consists of pita bread or some other flatbread such as saluf, laffa, or malawach, that was often leftover from another use or stale, and has been torn or cut into pieces and fried until crisp in a large amount of samneh (clarified butter), although butter or chicken schmaltz are also sometimes used. The mixture is combined with beaten/scrambled eggs, and cooked together in a manner similar to matzah brei or migas. In Israel it is traditionally topped with honey as a sweet dish, although savory versions also exist and some top it with labneh, tahini, shkug, resek avganiyot (grated tomatoes), among other toppings. Fatoot samneh has been compared by some to various dishes such as matzo brei, and migas, among others.\nMarks, Gil. The Encyclopedia of Jewish Food.\nKoenig, Leah. The Jewish Cookbook.

Jumbles are simple butter cookies made with a basic recipe of, flour, sugar, eggs, and butter. They can be flavored with vanilla, anise, or caraway seed used for flavoring, or other flavoring can be used like almond. They were formerly often made in the form of rings or rolls.\nJumbles were widespread, specifically because they travelled well, thanks to their very dense, hard nature. They could be stored for up to a year without becoming too stale. Because of their density, they were sometimes twisted into knots before baking, in order to make them easier to eat, generating knots as another common name.\nJumbles were traditionally shaped in intricate loop or knot patterns, usually of rolled out dough. Early flavouring agents were aniseed, coriander, caraway seeds and rosewater. Later, especially in the United States, jumbles referred to a  thin crisp cake or cookie using lemon-peel as a flavoring agent.\nJumbles and cookies are very similar, and sometimes a jumble may be called a cookie, but cookie is a broader term for any small flat cake, used for small cakes as well as crisp ones, while jumbles are usually of the crisp variety.\nA 1907 recipe for jumbles describes their texture as \"crisp like snaps\". The dough should be \"so thin after rolling and cutting out, that one can almost see through them\". The only moisture in the recipe is the creamed butter and \"a scant cupful of milk or enough to make a stiff dough about like pie crust\".\nA recipe for \"Almond Jumballs\" is known from 1694, made by combining ground almond with orange flower water or rose water, then adding sugar syrup, dry sugar and egg whites. The ingredients were pounded to make a paste and could be colored with chocolate or cochineal. They were brushed with lemon juice or rose water for enhanced flavor and very gently baked, with the caution that \"it is best to sett them on something that they may not touch ye bottome of ye Oven.\"\nJumbles were widespread in Europe by the 17th century, but possibly originated in Italy as the cimabetta. A very common cookie for travelers, they were probably brought to America on the Mayflower, if not Jamestown previously. There is even a famous recipe for this type of cookie that is credited to Martha Washington.\nAn 18th-century recipe from The Compleat Housewife is made by beating three egg whites with milk. flour, sugar and caraway seeds into a stiff paste. They could be made in any shape and baked on baking parchment.\nOriginally, jumbles were twisted into various pretzel-like shapes and boiled. By the late 18th century, jumbles became rolled cookies that were baked, producing a cookie very similar to a modern sugar cookie, although without the baking powder or other leavening agents used in modern recipes.\nVictorian cookbooks contain recipes for many variations on the basic recipe with candied fruits, coconut, lemon, and other flavorings added.\nThe word \"jumble\" is derived from the French jumelle, meaning \"twin\", because of their shape.\nWolley, Hannah: The Queen-like Closet, 1672\nRandolph, Mary: The Virginia Housewife, 1831\n\"All kinds of cookies\".

Jumbles are simple butter cookies made with a basic recipe of, flour, sugar, eggs, and butter. They can be flavored with vanilla, anise, or caraway seed used for flavoring, or other flavoring can be used like almond. They were formerly often made in the form of rings or rolls.\nJumbles were widespread, specifically because they travelled well, thanks to their very dense, hard nature. They could be stored for up to a year without becoming too stale. Because of their density, they were sometimes twisted into knots before baking, in order to make them easier to eat, generating knots as another common name.\nJumbles were traditionally shaped in intricate loop or knot patterns, usually of rolled out dough. Early flavouring agents were aniseed, coriander, caraway seeds and rosewater. Later, especially in the United States, jumbles referred to a  thin crisp cake or cookie using lemon-peel as a flavoring agent.\nJumbles and cookies are very similar, and sometimes a jumble may be called a cookie, but cookie is a broader term for any small flat cake, used for small cakes as well as crisp ones, while jumbles are usually of the crisp variety.\nA 1907 recipe for jumbles describes their texture as \"crisp like snaps\". The dough should be \"so thin after rolling and cutting out, that one can almost see through them\". The only moisture in the recipe is the creamed butter and \"a scant cupful of milk or enough to make a stiff dough about like pie crust\".\nA recipe for \"Almond Jumballs\" is known from 1694, made by combining ground almond with orange flower water or rose water, then adding sugar syrup, dry sugar and egg whites. The ingredients were pounded to make a paste and could be colored with chocolate or cochineal. They were brushed with lemon juice or rose water for enhanced flavor and very gently baked, with the caution that \"it is best to sett them on something that they may not touch ye bottome of ye Oven.\"\nJumbles were widespread in Europe by the 17th century, but possibly originated in Italy as the cimabetta. A very common cookie for travelers, they were probably brought to America on the Mayflower, if not Jamestown previously. There is even a famous recipe for this type of cookie that is credited to Martha Washington.\nAn 18th-century recipe from The Compleat Housewife is made by beating three egg whites with milk. flour, sugar and caraway seeds into a stiff paste. They could be made in any shape and baked on baking parchment.\nOriginally, jumbles were twisted into various pretzel-like shapes and boiled. By the late 18th century, jumbles became rolled cookies that were baked, producing a cookie very similar to a modern sugar cookie, although without the baking powder or other leavening agents used in modern recipes.\nVictorian cookbooks contain recipes for many variations on the basic recipe with candied fruits, coconut, lemon, and other flavorings added.\nThe word \"jumble\" is derived from the French jumelle, meaning \"twin\", because of their shape.\nWolley, Hannah: The Queen-like Closet, 1672\nRandolph, Mary: The Virginia Housewife, 1831\n\"All kinds of cookies\".

It is made from egg yolks, sugar, and flavourings such as honey, vanilla, cocoa or rum, similar to eggnog or zabaione. In its classic form it is served slightly chilled or at room temperature. Served warm or hot, it is considered a home remedy for sore throats. Variations include milk, honey and soda.\nKogel mogel became known by this name by the 17th-century Jewish communities of Central Europe. It may have its roots in the Jewish code of law called the Shulchan Arukh where one is allowed to consume sweet syrup and/or raw egg on Shabbat to make one's voice more pleasant.\nVasmer's dictionary mentions different hypotheses on the origin of the name such as English hug-mug, hugger-mugger, or German Kuddelmuddel.\nThe dessert was made popular during the communist era food shortages, including sugar. It is still eaten in Poland and in Polish communities around the world.\nKogel mogel is often prepared as a transition food for babies moving from a cereal diet to one that includes eggs and other soft foods. It is also a folk medicine used for treating colds or flu, particularly chest colds and laryngitis. Kogel mogel is ranked highly among other traditional cold remedies such as chicken soup. \nThe traditional usage of kogel mogel as a home remedy for treating a sore throat is supported by research done in Israel. The simplest form of preparation as a remedy is with no egg, but only honey added to warm milk.  More commonly, a single raw egg is added to a cup of warm milk and mixed with a tablespoon of honey.\nIn the German translation of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Humpty Dumpty is called Goggelmoggel.\nIn the 1985 film of Doctor Aybolit from the Soviet Union, Doctor Aybolit nurses sick pirates and animals back to health by giving them kogel mogel.\nKogel-mogel is a Polish 1988 comedy of manners film directed by Roman Za\u0142uski, starring Gra\u017cyna B\u0142\u0119cka-Kolska and Ewa Kasprzyk.\nA similar sounding phrase, Great Googly Moogly, an apparent euphemism for \"Great God Almighty,\", appears in a Howlin' Wolf song, \"Goin' Down Slow\", and in the work of Langston Hughes, and was later more generally popularized by Frank Zappa and Mr. Magoo.\nuovo sbattuto\u00a0\u2013 Italian breakfast\nEggnog\nRompope\u00a0\u2013 Eggnog-like drink from Latin America\nAdvocaat\u00a0\u2013 Dutch alcoholic beverage featuring eggs\nZabaione, also known as Zabaglione\u00a0\u2013 Italian dessert made with egg, sugar, and wine\nCoquito\u00a0\u2013 Puerto Rican rum and coconut milk cocktail\nEierpunsch\u00a0\u2013 Warm, sweetened alcoholic, egg-based drink\nList of custard desserts\u00a0\u2013 Wikipedia list article\nList of desserts\u00a0\u2013 Wikipedia list article\nPonche crema\u00a0\u2013 Cream liqueur from Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago\nFloating island\u00a0\u2013 Dessert made with meringue and cr\u00e8me anglaise\nPrevention, Alternative Health, Bubbes Remedies, Jewish Genetic Diseases, Jewish Medical Ethics\nPetrosian, Irina; David Underwood (2006).

Jumbles are simple butter cookies made with a basic recipe of, flour, sugar, eggs, and butter. They can be flavored with vanilla, anise, or caraway seed used for flavoring, or other flavoring can be used like almond. They were formerly often made in the form of rings or rolls.\nJumbles were widespread, specifically because they travelled well, thanks to their very dense, hard nature. They could be stored for up to a year without becoming too stale. Because of their density, they were sometimes twisted into knots before baking, in order to make them easier to eat, generating knots as another common name.\nJumbles were traditionally shaped in intricate loop or knot patterns, usually of rolled out dough. Early flavouring agents were aniseed, coriander, caraway seeds and rosewater. Later, especially in the United States, jumbles referred to a  thin crisp cake or cookie using lemon-peel as a flavoring agent.\nJumbles and cookies are very similar, and sometimes a jumble may be called a cookie, but cookie is a broader term for any small flat cake, used for small cakes as well as crisp ones, while jumbles are usually of the crisp variety.\nA 1907 recipe for jumbles describes their texture as \"crisp like snaps\". The dough should be \"so thin after rolling and cutting out, that one can almost see through them\". The only moisture in the recipe is the creamed butter and \"a scant cupful of milk or enough to make a stiff dough about like pie crust\".\nA recipe for \"Almond Jumballs\" is known from 1694, made by combining ground almond with orange flower water or rose water, then adding sugar syrup, dry sugar and egg whites. The ingredients were pounded to make a paste and could be colored with chocolate or cochineal. They were brushed with lemon juice or rose water for enhanced flavor and very gently baked, with the caution that \"it is best to sett them on something that they may not touch ye bottome of ye Oven.\"\nJumbles were widespread in Europe by the 17th century, but possibly originated in Italy as the cimabetta. A very common cookie for travelers, they were probably brought to America on the Mayflower, if not Jamestown previously. There is even a famous recipe for this type of cookie that is credited to Martha Washington.\nAn 18th-century recipe from The Compleat Housewife is made by beating three egg whites with milk. flour, sugar and caraway seeds into a stiff paste. They could be made in any shape and baked on baking parchment.\nOriginally, jumbles were twisted into various pretzel-like shapes and boiled. By the late 18th century, jumbles became rolled cookies that were baked, producing a cookie very similar to a modern sugar cookie, although without the baking powder or other leavening agents used in modern recipes.\nVictorian cookbooks contain recipes for many variations on the basic recipe with candied fruits, coconut, lemon, and other flavorings added.\nThe word \"jumble\" is derived from the French jumelle, meaning \"twin\", because of their shape.\nWolley, Hannah: The Queen-like Closet, 1672\nRandolph, Mary: The Virginia Housewife, 1831\n\"All kinds of cookies\".

Chelow kebab is served with accompaniments such as butter, sumac powder, basil, onions, and grilled tomatoes.

The traditional Hawaiian recipe for haupia calls for heated coconut milk to be mixed with ground pia (Polynesian arrowroot, Tacca leontopetaloides) until the mixture thickens. Due to the lack of availability of arrowroot starch, some modern recipes for haupia substitute cornstarch.\nHaupia is very similar to the European dessert blancmange.\nIn the typical modern recipe, diluted coconut milk, sugar, and salt is mixed with arrowroot or cornstarch and heated until thickened and smooth, then poured into a rectangular pan and chilled as with gelatin. It is traditionally cut into small blocks and served on squares of ti leaf or plain.\nA popular variation is haupia pie, where the haupia is set in a crust as one layer, then is usually accompanied with another layer of either chocolate or purple sweet potato. \nSome recipes for coconut desserts actually call for unflavored gelatin in place of the cornstarch, but it would be erroneous to call them haupia. Many local confections that contain coconut or coconut flavoring are advertised as haupia flavored.

It consists of fresh  choclo (Peruvian corn) pounded to a paste, wrapped in a fresh corn husk, and slowly steamed or boiled in a pot of water. In Bolivia it is known as huminta and in Brazil as pamonha. Humitas are similar to Mexican uchepos, which are also made with fresh corn; but they are only superficially similar to tamales, which are made with nixtamalized corn (masa).",

In Northwest Argentina, humitas are prepared with fresh corn, saut\u00e9ed onions, pumpkin, tomato and some spices, depending on the region or taste. The dough is wrapped in corn husks and boiled or it is cooked in a big pan and served in bowls. It is also common to add some diced cheese to the dough, typically queso fresco. They can be found in restaurants and markets in Tucuman and other provinces of the north of Argentina\nAs in Ecuador, humitas in Chile are prepared with fresh corn, onion, basil, and butter or lard. They are wrapped in corn husks and baked or boiled. They may contain aj\u00ed verde (green chili pepper). The humitas are kept together cooking with thread or twine. They can be made savory, sweet, or sweet and sour, served with added sugar, chile pepper, salt, tomato, olive and paprika etc. In Chile, humitas are traceable back to the 19th century.\nEcuadorian humitas are prepared with fresh ground corn with onions, eggs and spices that vary from region to region, and also by each family's tradition. The dough is wrapped in a corn husk, but is steamed rather than baked or boiled. Ecuadorian humitas may also contain cheese. This dish is so traditional in Ecuador that they have developed special pots just for cooking humitas. Ecuadorian humitas can be salty or sweet.\nIn the central Andes region, humitas are prepared with fresh corn combined with lard and salt and queso fresco for a savory dish or with fresh corn with lard, sugar, cinnamon and raisins for a sweet dish. Savory humitas may also be prepared with anise. These are typically very rare in other parts of South America.\nThese humitas are prepared with corn wrapped in corn husks and can be cooked in boiling water, placed in a pachamanca oven, or steamed. They can be wrapped in several ways.\nOne of the earliest references to huminta in Peru was written by the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega in his Comentarios Reales del Inca, which he published in Lisbon in 1609. In talking about huminta he describes his own memories of consumption about the time he lived in Peru between 1539 and 1560. From this it can be deduced that huminta was already prepared in Peru during this time.\nHallacas\nTamales\nSarmales\nPamonhas\nPasteles\nTayullos\nBinaki\nMontuca (Honduras)\nUchepos (Mexico, in Micoacan)\nChef Adds New Zest At La Pena Center, Kim Severson, San Francisco Chronicle, 06-08-1999, access date 05-12-2012\nPereira Salas, Eugenio (1977).

The beef patty is a product of the long history of Jamaica, mixing pasties introduced by Cornish immigrants and cumin, curry and cayenne pepper introduced by Indian indentured labourers and African slaves who arrived to the country. \"The firecracker taste of the Scotch bonnet, a hot pepper indigenous to Jamaica, sealed the flavour.\"\nJamaicans brought recipes for the patties northward in the 1960s and 1970s when many immigrated to the United States as hospital orderlies, home health aides and nurses. The patties were then found in restaurants in areas of the New York metropolitan area with high West Indian populations. The patties are equally popular in British cities with large West Indian populations, such as Birmingham, Manchester and London. Their popularity is spreading in the United Kingdom and they are becoming available in many mainstream outlets. They are also popular in Toronto, Montreal, Washington, D.C., and numerous other areas throughout the American northeast and Canadian Great Lakes regions; in many of those areas, they are available in grocery stores, delis, corner stores, and convenience stores. In recent years, the Jamaican meat patty has been pre-made and frozen for mass selling in Britain, Canada, and the United States. In many areas in Canada and in the United States, Jamaican beef patties are now typically available at pizza and convenience food restaurants, as well as supermarkets.\nChicken patty\nEmpanada\nJamaican cuisine\nList of Jamaican dishes\nPatty\nMichelle Garcia For N.Y.

The origin of the name \u201cWatergate salad\u201d is obscure. The recipe was published by General Foods (since merged into what is now Kraft Heinz) and called for two General Foods products: Jell-O instant pistachio pudding and Cool Whip whipped topping, a whipped-cream substitute. According to Kraft, \"There are several urban myths regarding the name change, but we can't substantiate any of them.\" Several competing explanations exist.\nKraft Corporate Affairs said: \"We developed the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight. It was in 1975, the same year that pistachio pudding mix came out.\" Kraft, however, didn't refer to it as Watergate Salad until consumers started requesting the recipe for it under the name. \"According to Kraft Kitchens, when the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight was sent out, an unnamed Chicago food editor renamed it Watergate Salad to promote interest in the recipe when she printed it in her column.\" Neither the article nor editor has been tracked down, however.\nThe Denver Post, in the Empire Magazine of June 27, 1976, published a recipe for Watergate Salad. It is sometimes said that Watergate salad was invented by a sous chef at the Watergate Hotel, and it was then served at brunch on most weekends. Watergate Salad took off in popularity during and after the presidential scandal which shares the same name. However, the Denver Post article does not verify this rumor, noting like most sources that the origins of the name are obscure.\nSyndicated household advice columnists Anne Adams and Nan Nash-Cummings, in their \"Anne & Nan\" column of October 9, 1997, reported that name came from the similar \"Watergate Cake\" (which shares most of the same ingredients): \"The recipes came out during the Watergate scandal. The cake has a 'cover-up' icing and is full of nuts. The salad is also full of nuts.\" Both cake and salad were part of a trend for satirically-named recipes such as Nixon's Perfectly Clear Consomme and Liddy's Clam-Up Chowder.\nIn 1922 Helen Keller published a similar recipe, calling for canned diced pineapple, nuts, marshmallows, whipped cream and other ingredients. \"I ate it first in California, so I call it Golden Gate Salad\". Similar \"fruit salad\" and \"pineapple salad\" recipes had been published in the 1910s, and \"Golden Gate Salad\" was served in some American hotels.\nList of salads\nRecipe from Deseret News April 3, 1985\nRecipe from Cooks.com\nRecipe from Cooks.com\nVan Dyke, Louis (2013).

The version known in Nice in the late 19th century was a basic combination of tomatoes,  anchovies and olive oil, described as \"simple food for poor people\". Over time,  other fresh and mostly raw ingredients were added to the salad as served in Nice. A 1903 recipe by Henri Heyraud in a book called La Cuisine \u00e0 Nice included tomatoes, anchovies, artichokes, olive oil, red peppers and black olives, but excluded tuna and lettuce. The dressing included olive oil,  vinegar,  mustard and fines herbes.\nFormer Nice mayor and cookbook author Jacques M\u00e9decin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen called for the salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: \"never, never, I beg you, include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade ni\u00e7oise.\" M\u00e9decin wrote that the salad should be made \"predominantly of tomatoes\" which should be \"salted three times and moistened with olive oil\". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna,  but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, M\u00e9decin believed that salade ni\u00e7oise \"was a product of the sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi.\" M\u00e9decin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad,  commenting, \"As the various ingredients that go into salade ni\u00e7oise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl.\"\nAn organization called Cercle de la Capelina d\u2019Or, led for many years by Ren\u00e9e Graglia until her death in 2013, continues to protest against deviation from traditional local recipes. The group, which certifies restaurants in Nice, sticks with  M\u00e9decin's standards. They reject commonly included ingredients such as green beans and potatoes, as well as innovations such as including sweet corn, mayonnaise, shallots and lemon.\nIn 2016, French Michelin-starred chef H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze posted a salade ni\u00e7oise recipe on Facebook that included cooked potatoes and green beans. According to journalist Mathilde Fr\u00e9nois, the reaction on Facebook was quick and hostile from the \"purists\". Darroze's version was called \"a massacre of the recipe\", a \"sacrilege\", and a violation of the \"ancestral traditions\" of the salad. She was warned that it is \"dangerous to innovate\".\nThe question of the proper ingredients appropriate for a salade ni\u00e7oise has long been the subject of debate and even controversy. The British cook Nigella Lawson observed \"Everyone seems to have a very strong opinion as to what should or should not go into a Salade Ni\u00e7oise\". Chef and cookbook author Auguste Escoffier (1846\u20131935), born in Villeneuve-Loubet near Nice, added potatoes and green beans, an innovation that remains controversial as a \"questionable idea\" a century later.\nSalade ni\u00e7oise has been known in the United States since at least the 1920s, when a cookbook for hotel chefs included two variations. The first was vegetarian,  was dressed with mayonnaise, and included lettuce, tomatoes,  potatoes, stringless beans and pimento-stuffed olives, while the second version was a composed salad,  including the same ingredients, plus anchovies.\nThe dish was included in the 1936 cookbook L'Art culinaire moderne by Henri-Paul Pellaprat, which was first translated for American cooks in 1966 as Modern French Culinary Art. His version included cold cooked potatoes and cold cooked green beans.\nA 1941 U.S. version by chef Louis Diat of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel included the anchovies, was dressed with vinaigrette, and added capers.\nThe highly influential 1961 American cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, included a recipe that incorporated a potato salad, green beans, both tuna and anchovies and a vinaigrette dressing. Co-author Julia Child later demonstrated the recipe on her television show, The French Chef, in 1970.\nA recipe was included in Prosper Montagn\u00e9's Larousse Gastronomique in 1938. It called for \"equal parts diced potatoes and French beans. Season with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix with anchovy fillets, olives and capers. Garnish with quartered tomatoes.\"\nFrench chef Paul Bocuse included a vegetarian version of the salad, garnished with chopped onion and chervil, in the 1977 English translation of his cookbook.\nA 1979 variation by Pierre Franey is called Salade Ni\u00e7oise aux Poires d'Avocat.  Franey wrote,  \"I am convinced that had avocados been native to Provence they would have been an inevitable ingredient in",

                "description": "The frog cake is an Australian dessert in the shape of a frog's head, composed of sponge cake and cream covered with fondant. It was created by the Balfours bakery in 1922, and soon became a popular treat in South Australia. Originally frog cakes were available exclusively in green, but later brown and pink were added to the range. Since then other variations have been developed, including seasonal varieties (such as snowmen and Easter \"chicks\"). The frog cake has been called \"uniquely South Australian\", and has been employed in promoting the state. In recognition of its cultural significance, in 2001 the frog cake was listed as a South Australian Heritage Icon by the National Trust of South Australia.",

The frog cake is a small dessert shaped to resemble a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream and covered with a thick layer of fondant icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.\nHaving travelled to France in the early 1920s, Gordon Balfour, the nephew of John Balfour, (who was one of the co-founders of Balfours Bakery), found inspiration for the frog cake in European confectionery. The frog cake was introduced by Balfours in 1922 after Gordon's return to Adelaide, during a time in which tearooms were still popular in the city. It soon became known as the Balfours mascot, and has traditionally only been sold in South Australia, although they are now sold in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland as well.\nThe original frog cakes were green in colour, and green remains the most popular of the options, but chocolate and pink coloured versions were later added to the range. In addition, while the frog motif dominates, special occasions have resulted in slightly different designs \u2013 such as Father Christmas and Snowman cakes released during Christmas seasons and \"Chick\" cakes around Easter. Frog cakes have also been released in the colours of the Adelaide Football Club.\nFrog cakes have long been regarded as a South Australian icon, and have at times been used to help promote the state. For example, in 2001 frog cakes were given to judges during Joan Hall's final pitch in a successful bid to win the 2007 World Police and Fire Games for Adelaide. While there have been tongue-in-cheek and satirical suggestions to build monuments to the frog cake, such as that made by Peter Goers, a more realistic recognition of the frog cake came in 2001 when it was one of the first items to be selected as a South Australian Icon by the National Trust of South Australia during the 165th anniversary of the state, adding the frog cake to the National Heritage Listing as a \"movable asset\".\nHistorically, the frog cake has sold well for Balfours, and at times sales have peaked in response to events surrounding the company. When the company was placed into receivership in 2000, a column in The Advertiser by Rex Jory called for people to support the company by purchasing the cakes, and in response sales doubled to an \"all-time high\". Similarly, the 2001 inclusion of the frog cake as a South Australian icon saw a comparable increase in sales. The success of the frog cake has led to imitations, and in response Balfours registered both the name and the shape of the product as a trademark in 2001.\nThe Danish Fr\u00f8kage (\"frog cake\") dates back to at least the 1950s. During the 1970s it became known as a Kajkage (\"Kaj cake\"), named after the character of Kaj the frog in the Danish children's television puppet show Kaj & Andrea. Visually similar to the Australian cake, it has a thin macron bottom instead of sponge, and is topped with green marzipan rather than fondant.\nFrog cakes are similar in composition to British manufacturer Mr Kipling's French Fancies.\nList of cakes\u00a0\u2013 Wikipedia list article\nSouth Australian food and drink\nPrincess cake\u00a0\u2013 Traditional Swedish layer cake, a broadly similar Swedish dessert\nJauncey (May 2004)\nJauncey (2004), p. 211.\nFlanders (2007), p. 36.\nHockley (26 May 2001), p. 29.\nClarke (17 June 2003), p. 31.\nHaran (2001)\nGoers (2007)\nLloyd (7 April 2001), p. 30.\nHooper (9 November 2000), p. 11.\n\"Protection for frog cake\" (12 September 2001), p. 9.\n\"Historien om Kaj-kagen - TV 2\". livsstil.tv2.dk. 13 August 2013.\n\"Det dufter og smager - n\u00e5r Hans han bager\". ugeavisen.dk. 18 November 2019.\nClarke, Daniel (17 June 2003). \"Our State South Australia, Diverse, Different and Dynamic Beyond Value\".

Foam cakes are cakes with very little (if any) fatty material such as butter, oil or shortening. They are leavened primarily by the air that is beaten into the egg whites that they contain. They differ from butter cakes, which contain shortening, and baking powder or baking soda for leavening purposes. Foam cakes are typically airy, light and spongy. After it is cooked, the cake and the pan are flipped down on a sheet pan with parchment paper in order for them to cool down at the same rate.

Tchaka or Chaka is a Haitian stew made from hominy, beans, pumpkin (joumou), and meat (usually pork). It is used as an offering to the loa in Haitian Vodou. The nutritious soup is also associated with festivities and family time.\nOther names for the dish are tyaka, chaka, or tiaka depending on the region. Typical of Haitian cuisine, this dish has influences of many different cultures.\nThe recipe is usually made with salted and smoked pork which imparts a great deal of flavor. This pork is from where most of the flavor comes. The parts of the pig that are used is traditionally the trotter, bacon, shoulder, palette, or loin.\nVarious beans can be used, including pinto, red kidney, small red, and dark red. Dried corn is used, where it can increase fourfold in volume when boiled in water.\nSeveral other local variations exist which use beef, mutton, or crab instead of pork. Some recipes use coconut milk which provides a creamy consistency. Some recipes use squash, yam, or malanga.\nTchaka is usually served during special occasions because it requires a relatively long time to prepare. For example, it can be served during family gatherings. It can also be served on November 1 for All Saints\u2019 Day, on May 1 for Labor Day to honor Azakah Medeh, the loa of harvest and agriculture. In Haitian Vodou, tchaka was the favorite dish of this loa.\nTchaka was mentioned in a song by Haitian musician, Sydney Guillaume, when he wrote: \n\u201cChofe dife! Nou pral manje tchaka! Chofe dife, brase mayi, pa bliye tisale, Nou pral manje yon bon tchaka. Nou pral voye monte yon bouyon t\u00e8t chaje\u201d (\u201cLight the fire! We will eat tchaka! Light the fire, mix the corn, don\u2019t forget the salted pork, we will eat a delicious tchaka, we will cook an incredible stew\u201d).\nHaitians oftentimes cook tchaka during school vacations since it is protein-rich and thought to help with children\u2019s growth.\nList of soups\nFoundation, A.R.C.

Today, local barbecue restaurants use a specific meat in their recipes, usually pork, chicken, or mutton, which, along with the spices used, creates a flavor unique to each restaurant. A typical burgoo is a combination of meats and vegetables: Common meats are pork, chicken, mutton or beef, often hickory-smoked, but other meats are seen occasionally.

Burgoo is a stew, similar to Irish or Mulligan stew, often served with cornbread or corn muffins.  It is often prepared communally as a social gathering. It is popular as the basis for civic fund-raisers in the American Midwest and South.\nThe term is of uncertain origin, possibly from the combination of the Welsh words for \"yeast\" and \"cabbage\".\nCooking burgoo in Kentucky often serves as a communal effort and social event in which each attendee brings one or more ingredients. In Kentucky and surrounding states such as Indiana, burgoo is often used for school fund-raising. This has been claimed as an invention of the family of Ollie Beard, a former Major League Baseball player.\nMany places hold great pride in their burgoo, and it is a common feature in local events. The village of Arenzville, Illinois asserts itself as the home of the world's best burgoo and holds a yearly burgoo festival, as does Chandlerville, Illinois, in Cass County and Utica, IL in LaSalle County. Several cities claim to be the burgoo capital of the world, including Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, Owensboro, Kentucky, and Franklin, Illinois. In Brighton, Illinois, a local traditional burgoo is prepared and served annually at the village's summer festival, the Betsey Ann Picnic. In the Kentucky Derby, Burgoo is often served and is considered an iconic dish.\nBooyah, a social stew popular in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin\nBrunswick stew\nFish fry, often an event and social group fund raiser\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nList of stews\nList of meat dishes\nSouthern Illinois chowder, another kind of social stew\n\"burgoo\".

                "description": "There are two methods of preparing stamppot, the first being the more modern form:\nStamppot is prepared by boiling the vegetables and potatoes separately. Once done, the potatoes are added to the same pot as the vegetables and all are thoroughly mashed together. Rookworst, a type of smoked sausage, is the preferred piece of meat to be added to the dish in the Netherlands. Stamppot can also be made in a single pot. Potatoes and the vegetables or fruit of choice are placed in the pot. Water is added, and the mixture is left to boil. After the vegetables are cooked and drained, some milk, butter and salt are added, and the vegetables are mashed together.

Stamppot (English: Mash pot) is a traditional Dutch dish made from a combination of potatoes mashed with one or several vegetables.\nThese vegetable pairings traditionally include sauerkraut, endive, kale, spinach, turnip greens, or carrot and onion (the combination of the latter two is known as hutspot in the Netherlands and as wortelstoemp in Belgium). Leafy greens such as endive may be left raw and added to the potatoes only at the mashing stage. Some less common regional varieties of stamppot are made with fruit and potatoes, such as blauwe bliksem (blue lightning), made with pears, and hete bliksem (hot lightning), made with sweet apples. Pineapple may also be included in sauerkraut or endive stamppot. In recent years, variations on the traditional stamppot have been becoming more and more popular with people adding ingredients such as rocket, leeks, beets, sweet potato, mushrooms and various other vegetables. Sometimes, fish is used as an ingredient in stamppot as well instead of serving it as a separate dish. Stamppot is primarily a cold-weather dish. \nStamppot is usually served with sausage (in the Netherlands often smoked, in Belgium more often fried), julienned bacon, or stewed meat. Other accompaniments include cheese, gherkins, nuts or pickled onions.\nPrepared stamppot can be purchased from shops and supermarkets. It can also be ordered in cafe-style restaurants, but more strict recent regulations about allowed foods in taverns versus restaurants has restricted the custom of offering simple dishes in many Belgian pubs.\nThe origin of stamppot is unknown, although legend attributes the invention of hutspot to 1574. Using raw leafy vegetables instead of cooking them with the potatoes has not been dated to earlier than 1940.\nBiksemad, from Denmark\nBubble and squeak, from England\nChamp, and Colcannon, from Ireland\nRumbledethumps, from Scotland\nRoupa velha (Portuguese for \"old clothes\"), from Portugal, often made from leftovers from Cozido \u00e0 Portuguesa\nStoemp, from Belgium\nTrinxat, from the Empord\u00e0 region of Catalonia, northeast Spain, and Andorra\nCaldo verde, a Portuguese soup with similar ingredients.\n\"Andijviestamppot met ananas\" [Endive stamppot with pineapple].

Tchaka or Chaka is a Haitian stew made from hominy, beans, pumpkin (joumou), and meat (usually pork). It is used as an offering to the loa in Haitian Vodou. The nutritious soup is also associated with festivities and family time.\nOther names for the dish are tyaka, chaka, or tiaka depending on the region. Typical of Haitian cuisine, this dish has influences of many different cultures.\nThe recipe is usually made with salted and smoked pork which imparts a great deal of flavor. This pork is from where most of the flavor comes. The parts of the pig that are used is traditionally the trotter, bacon, shoulder, palette, or loin.\nVarious beans can be used, including pinto, red kidney, small red, and dark red. Dried corn is used, where it can increase fourfold in volume when boiled in water.\nSeveral other local variations exist which use beef, mutton, or crab instead of pork. Some recipes use coconut milk which provides a creamy consistency. Some recipes use squash, yam, or malanga.\nTchaka is usually served during special occasions because it requires a relatively long time to prepare. For example, it can be served during family gatherings. It can also be served on November 1 for All Saints\u2019 Day, on May 1 for Labor Day to honor Azakah Medeh, the loa of harvest and agriculture. In Haitian Vodou, tchaka was the favorite dish of this loa.\nTchaka was mentioned in a song by Haitian musician, Sydney Guillaume, when he wrote: \n\u201cChofe dife! Nou pral manje tchaka! Chofe dife, brase mayi, pa bliye tisale, Nou pral manje yon bon tchaka. Nou pral voye monte yon bouyon t\u00e8t chaje\u201d (\u201cLight the fire! We will eat tchaka! Light the fire, mix the corn, don\u2019t forget the salted pork, we will eat a delicious tchaka, we will cook an incredible stew\u201d).\nHaitians oftentimes cook tchaka during school vacations since it is protein-rich and thought to help with children\u2019s growth.\nList of soups\nFoundation, A.R.C.

Fried plantain is a dish cooked wherever plantains grow, from West Africa to East Africa as well as Central America, the tropical region of northern South America and the Caribbean countries like Haiti to Cuba  and in many parts of Southeast Asia, where fried snacks are widely popular. In Indonesia it is called gorengan. It is called alloco in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and dodo in Western Nigeria, otherwise known as simply fried plantain in other parts of Nigeria. Kelewele is a fried spicy plantain or can be fried as a side dish for Red Red (African stewed black-eyed peas) and fish stew in Ghana.\nFried plantain is also eaten in some countries in South America or the Caribbean where African influence is present. For example, in the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Puerto Rico, it is common to cut plantains in slices, fry them until they are yellow, smash them between two plates and fry them again. This is also a common dish in Haiti, referred to as bannann peze, and throughout Central America, referred to as patacones in Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador,  and as tostones in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico. In Honduras and Venezuela they are referred to as tajadas.\nFried plantain may be served as a snack, a starter or as a side dish to the main course, such as with Jollof rice, spicy barbecued meat, tomato stew or beans. It is made in different ways: salted or unsalted, cut into \"ears\", \"fingers\", can be diced, or fried whole.\nFried yellow plantains are sweet bananas from Central America and the Caribbean fried in hot oil. They are sometimes eaten with sour cream, ketchup, or a mayonnaise-ketchup mixture.\nAlloco, as it is called in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, is called dodo in Nigeria, missol\u00e8 in Cameroon and makemba in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is a popular West African snack made from fried plantain. It is often served with chili pepper and onions. In Nigeria, it often serves as a side or can be consumed by itself.  \nAlloco is widely considered as fast-food and is sold on the streets of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. An area with many grilled meat and alloco food vendors in the Cocody neighborhood is named Allocodrome, after this dish.\nKelewele is a popular Ghanaian food made of fried plantains seasoned with spices. In English, it is sometimes referred to as hot plantain crisps. In Accra, kelewele is usually sold at night by street vendors and sometimes in the afternoon by the country side women. It can be served with beans stew, peanuts, or alone as a dessert. Kelewele is also a popular choice for dinner.\nOriginally from Ghana, kelewele has been popularized in America by several recipe books (recipezaar, 2009)\nBanana fritter\nTostones\nChifle\nBanana chip\nVegetable chips\nIsoun, H.O.

Typically G\u00e2teau Basque is constructed from layers of a wheat flour based cake (a butter-sugar pastry dough, in this case p\u00e2te sabl\u00e9e, not bris\u00e9e) with a filling of either black cherry jam or almond or vanilla pastry cream. It has been argued that only black Xapata cherries native to the Basque Country should be used. \nThe type of dough used may vary a little. If butter is warmed before mixing with flour the dough will be called p\u00e2te sucr\u00e9e. If it is cold the mixing process will require more work and the dough is called p\u00e2te sabl\u00e9e (it is crumblier). The resulting textures are a little different but mostly for the initiated taster. The flour used is a soft wheat flour with little mineral content (that is, a refined flour, common pastry/cake flour) The proportion of sugar used also varies. But the principle of this cake is having a soft shortbread-type dough 3 to 6\u00a0mm thick filled with an almond pastry cream, also called frangipane, and with a shiny egg-coating.\nIt is traditional to mark a Basque cross on the top if the cake is filled with black cherry jam, or to use a crosshatch pattern on top if filled with pastry cream.\nThe origins of G\u00e2teau Basque are tied strongly with the town of Cambo-les-Bains, Labourd. It may have originally been made with bread and called bistochak in the 18th century. The fishermen took it out to sea. The first known commercialisation of the cake was by Marianne Hirigoyen in Cambo in the first half of the 19th century. Later editions were flavoured with rum, brought back to France by Basques from the West Indies.\nThe G\u00e2teau Basque Festival (F\u00eate du G\u00e2teau Basque) is organized each year in Cambo-les-Bains. Eguzkia (\"sun\" in Basque), an association to promote quality Basque cake, was founded in France in 1994. There is a museum dedicated to the cake, Le mus\u00e9e du G\u00e2teau Basque, in Sare, Labourd.\nList of cherry dishes\nDurbec, Val\u00e9rie. \"Les origines du g\u00e2teau basque\".

During the plague epidemic in 1643, the aldermen of Lyon made the vow to organize a procession at Fourvi\u00e8re to implore the Virgin Mary to save the city. They carried a 7-pound (3.2\u00a0kg) wax candle and a gold crown on a silk cushion. This gave the chocolatier Voisin, based in Lyon since 1897, the idea of using the shape of the cushion to create this confection in 1960. It has become the most popular French specialty confection containing chocolate ganache.\nThis delicacy has become very popular. It is possible to buy the \"cushions\" individually, and also in velvet boxes which recall the original form of silk cushion.\nThe Boucaud family has a monopoly in marketing the coussins, which it makes in its network of retail stores across the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region and in Marseille. In 2010 company manager, Paul Boucaud, said that Voisin manufactures annually 85 tonnes (94 tons) of coussins in Lyon and that production increases by 10% year on year.

Also known as picadita (in Tierra Caliente, Guerrero), it originates in the central and southern parts of Mexico, where it was sometimes first known as pellizcadas. It is an antojito, which at first sight looks like an unusually thick tortilla with vegetables and meat toppings.

The sope has spread throughout all Mexico's territory, and thousands of regional variants are made. Even though Sopes are traditionally from Mexico, many Central American countries have adopted this delicious dish into their cuisine, with slightly different ingredients, and very similar to Salvadoran enchiladas. \nWhile the pinched sides of the sope are its most distinctive characteristic,  flat sopes are made to resemble a thick tortilla or a tostada. However, though both tostadas and sopes are fried, the tostada is thin and fried until it becomes crunchy and fragile, while the sope is much thicker and fried only until the exterior surface is cooked. The sope, therefore, has a soft, slightly pliable texture. The sope's thickness is meant to support its toppings, and the frying of its exterior surface adds resistance to the moisture of the ingredients.\nThe most common variation of the sope involves simply adding chicken and is widely known as a sope de pollo.  Sopes topped with beef are also a common variation and are typically slightly larger than sopes de pollo.\nIn the northern regions of Mexico, sopes are often prepared without vegetables, substituting black beans, spicy salsa, and longaniza or chorizo, instead.  In Acapulco and Guerrero, sopes are unusually small in size, so they are called sopecitos instead, and are fried in the same oil used to fry seafood, which gives them a unique taste. Sopecitos are made of beans and salsa only; no other ingredients are added.\nIn Oaxaca, sopes sometimes are prepared using chapulines (roasted grasshoppers) as topping. Also, an extremely large dish similar to a giant sope or a giant tostada is the traditional food of reference in Oaxaca known as tlayuda.\nThe sope has been adopted and adapted to the local tastes of all Mexico's regions. This resulted in the creation of many traditional food specialties, which may appear to resemble the sope, but are considered a different dish.\nThe most common variation is the huarache, which is prepared in almost the same manner. However, the huarache normally is two or three times as large as a sope and has a characteristic oblong shape. Huaraches are usually topped with rib, chicken, or beefsteak meat. The name huarache is derived from the shape of the masa, similar to the popular sandals. Toppings for the huarache include beans, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, ground beef, and salsa.\nThe tlacoyo is a completely different traditional Mexican dish which must not be confused with a sope, but in some regions has started to be used in a similar way, as a base on top of which are placed the same ingredients used for sopes. A tlacoyo is an oval fried or toasted cake made of masa, torpedo-shaped and a lot fatter, since it is filled with beans or cheese.\nSince it is similar in shape to a huarache (but smaller), and is made of the same corn as the sope and is even thicker (so it has more resistance to humid foods), Mexican street vendors decided to sell it adding toppings on it, as an alternative to the sope. However, the traditional tlacoyo it is supposed to be consumed without any toppings on it, and this form is mostly found as street food.\nGarnachas are small corn tortillas fried with shredded meat, crumbled dried cheese, and salsa. In many instances, garnachas may only have chopped onion and salsa on top. Similar in appearance to sopes, they are a main specialty from Guatemala.\nOaxacan memelas are a local name for the identical sopes served in other parts of Mexico, just made with different toppings. Memelas are corn masa cakes topped with beans, salsa, shredded cabbage, mole negro, guacamole, and cheese. Memelas have been served at Oaxacan/Mexican restaurants in the United States since the 1990s. In Puebla, they are often served by topping the fried masa with sauce - red sauce on one side and green sauce on the other side which is called estilo bandera.  Instead of meat, memelas in Puebla are served with sour cream, crumbled cheese, and diced onions on top of the red and green sauces.\nA chalupa is a tostada platter in Mexican cuisine, not a sope, but its preparation method is quite similar. It is a specialty of south-central Mexico, such as the states of Puebla, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. It is made by pressing a thin layer of masa dough around the outside of a small mold and deep frying to produce a crisp, shallow corn cup. It is filled with various ingredients such as shredded chicken, pork, chopped onion, chipotle pepper, red salsa, and green salsa.\nThe chalupa is usually longer than a sope, resembling the canoe-like boat that is its namesake, although small versions (named chalupitas) are available in other regions. An Americanized form is sold in",

Klen\u00e4ter are an old type of pastry and are mentioned in Denmark as early as the 14th century and appearing in Danish and Icelandic cookbooks in the 18th century and 19th century. They are also referenced in a Swedish poem by Anna Maria Lenngren from 1800, called Grevinnans bes\u00f6k (English: The Countess' Visit). In the poem, a countess is invited to a dinner party at the home of a pastor, where she is served klen\u00e4ter as part of the entr\u00e9e. Klen\u00e4ter also frequently appear in Christmas stories by famous Swedish author Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1909.\nIn Norway, klen\u00e4ter are known as fattigmann (English: poor man), or Fattigmannbakkels (English: poor man pastry), because, it was said, the high cost of making the cookies could leave you impoverished (fattig). Fattigmann tend to be made with cinnamon, cardamom and a dash of cognac as well as the other ingredients listed below.\nThey are also eaten in the areas of North America where Scandinavians settled during the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century.\nA similar pastry called \"calzones rotos\" (literally \"broken panties\") is eaten during winter in Chile.\nThe dough for klen\u00e4ter is made from flour, egg yolks, sugar, and margarine or butter. The dough is rolled out and then cut into strips, in Iceland often with a special cutting wheel called a kleinuj\u00e1rn. (A pizza cutter can also be used.) The size may vary, but about 10 centimetres (4\u00a0in) long is typical. The uncooked strips are covered with plastic wrap and left to rest for two hours in a cold place. They are then fried in oil or sometimes lard and the dough expands into shape.  Traditionally, Icelanders fried kleinur in sheep tallow, but today oil is typically used.\nLemon juice, br\u00e4nnvin or cognac are optional ingredients in klen\u00e4ter. Water mixed with acetic acid can be used instead. An alternative type of klen\u00e4ter is sm\u00f6rdegsklen\u00e4tter (English: puff pastry klen\u00e4ter).\nKlen\u00e4ter should be kept in a dry place. The non-fried dough can be preserved in a refrigerator for a week. Klen\u00e4ter are best served medium-warm and newly baked.\nList of doughnut varieties\nList of breakfast foods\n\u00a0Food portal\n\"Matlexicon - Klen\u00e4t\" (in Swedish). Milda (Unilever).

Klepon is a boiled rice cake stuffed with liquid palm sugar (gula jawa/merah/melaka) and coated in flaked coconut. The dough is made from glutinous rice flour, sometimes mixed with tapioca, and a paste made from the leaves of the pandan or dracaena plants (daun suji) \u2014 whose leaves are used widely in Southeast Asian cooking \u2013 giving the dough its green colour.\nThe small pieces of palm sugar are initially solid when inserted into the glutinous rice dough and rolled into balls. The balls are subsequently boiled, which melts the palm sugar and creates a sweet liquid inside the balls' cores. Skill is involved in ensuring that the liquid does not leak out of the final product. The balls are finally rolled in shredded coconut, adhering to the sticky surface of the glutinous rice dough.\nKlepon are ideally left to cool for some time before consumption to prevent burning from the hot liquid palm sugar. They are traditionally served in banana leaves, usually in sets of four or ten balls; plastic packaging is also used in recent times.\nKlepon is the Javanese name for this sweet glutinous rice balls, which literally means \"animal's ovary\". In other parts of Indonesia, such as in Sulawesi, Sumatra and in neighbouring Malaysia, it is mainly known as onde-onde since many non-Javanese often confuse it with another kind of jajan, \"onde-onde\" (Chinese jian dui).\nIn some regions, 'buah melaka' (Malaccan fruit). In Java however, onde-onde refers to the Chinese jian dui, a rice cake ball coated with sesame seeds and filled with sweet green bean paste. Although popular in Indonesia and neighboring areas, klepon is originated in Java. This can be proven by its etymology, history, and how this food is spread outside the region. \nThe dish is also called as klepon in the Netherlands, due to its colonial ties with Java. In the 1950s, klepon was introduced by Indo immigrants to the Netherlands and is readily available in toko shops, Dutch or Chinese Indonesian restaurants and supermarkets throughout the country.\nIn Java, klepon, along with getuk and cenil, are often eaten as morning or afternoon snacks. They are categorised as jajan pasar (market snack) in traditional markets and villages and kue basah (moist kue) in urban areas due to Chinese influence in the naming.\nTraditional klepon or onde onde is quite homogenous in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Nevertheless, new recipes has been developed: some modern variants replacing the rice flour with yam or sweet potato (Indonesian: ubi) dough, or replacing the liquid palm sugar filling with chocolate, or replacing the grated coconut with grated cheddar cheese. Colourful klepon also has been created using potato-based dough and food colouring to make them more appealing for children.\nKlepon is quite similar to Kue putu, with the difference in its shape, texture and the flour being used \u2014 klepon uses glutinous rice flour, while kue putu uses common rice flour, klepon has somewhat a chewy sticky texture similar to mochi, while kue putu has soft yet crumbly texture akin to common cake. Klepon shape is balls, while kue putu is tubular using hollow bamboo tube as mould.\nRecently there is a modern fusion that combine the baking technique of cupcake with onde-onde ingredients.\nIn India, these snacks resembles a klepon, known as paan ladoo, but with different ingredients.\nList of Indonesian cuisine\nJavanese cuisine\nList of stuffed dishes\n101 Kue Nusantara.

Laffa, also known as lafa or Iraqi pita, is a large, thin flatbread in Israeli cuisine, of Iraqi origin. It is cooked in a tannur (tandoor) or taboon oven. Laffa does not form a pocket like a Levantine pita; it is most often used to wrap sandwiches such as falafel and shawarma, to dip in hummus, matbucha and other dips, or with shakshouka, and other dishes. It is also the traditional bread used in sabich, an Israeli eggplant sandwich. It is similar to, or indistinguishable from, many tandoor breads found in Asia including naan and the traditional Palestinian taboon bread.\nMembers of the Jewish community of Iraq, almost all of whom emigrated to Israel in the mid-20th century, brought with them the standard Iraqi flatbread known as aish tannur or simply khubz (bread). It was the traditional bread baked in their communal outdoor wood or coal-fired ovens, and served as an accompaniment to a myriad of dishes. In Iraq, a sandwich or wrap made with this bread is called a laffa; in Israel the name became applied to the bread itself.

                "unshown_background": ": Infobox prepared food. image: Dulce de membrillo.jpg. main_ingredient: Quince, sugar. name: Quince paste. type: Jelly. Quince cheese (also known as quince paste) is a sweet, thick jelly made of the pulp of the quince fruit. It is a common confection in several countries.\nTraditionally and predominantly from the Iberian Peninsula, it is called ate or dulce de membrillo in Spanish, marmelada in Portuguese, marmelo in Galician  and codonyat in Catalan, where it is a firm, sticky, sweet reddish hard paste made of the quince (Cydonia oblonga) fruit. It is also very popular in Brazil (as marmelada), France (as p\u00e2te de coing), Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico, Paraguay and Chile (as dulce de membrillo), Italy (as cotognata), Peru (as machacado de membrillo), and Turkey (as ayva peltesi).\nThe recipe is probably of ancient origin; the Roman cookbook of Apicius, a collection of Roman cookery recipes compiled in the late 4th or early 5th century AD gives recipes for stewing quince with honey.\nHistorically, marmalade was made from quinces. The English word \"marmalade\" comes from the Portuguese word marmelada, meaning \"quince preparation\" (and used to describe quince cheese or quince jam; \"marmelo\" = \"quince\"). Nowadays (in English), \"A marmalade is a jellied fruit product which holds suspended within it all or part of the fruit pulp and the sliced peel. It is prepared from pulpy fruits, preferably those that contain pectin. Citrus fruits are especially desirable because of their flavor and pectin content.\"\nIn Spain, Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Ecuador the quince (Spanish membrillo) is cooked into a reddish gelatin-like block or firm reddish paste known as dulce de membrillo. In Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay similar preparations are made by replacing quince by other ingredients, like  sweet potatoes, squashes, apricots, figs or guavas.\nThe pastafrola, a sweet tart common in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, is usually filled with quince paste. In Argentina and Uruguay, a slice of quince cheese (dulce de membrillo) eaten with a slice of soft cheese is considered the national dessert. In Argentina it is referred to as vigilante. In Uruguay it is known as Mart\u00edn Fierro in reference to the folk character from the epic poem Mart\u00edn Fierro by Argentinian author Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez.  \nIn French \"quince paste\" or p\u00e2te de coing is part of the Provence Christmas traditions and part of the thirteen desserts, which are the traditional dessert foods used in celebrating Christmas in the French region of Provence.\nIn Serbia, especially Vojvodina, all of Hungary, and continental Croatia, i.e., Slavonija quince cheese is an often prepared sweet and is named kitn(i)kes, derived from German \"Quittenk\u00e4se\".\nQuince cheese, a New England specialty of the 18th century, required all-day boiling to achieve a solidified state, similar to the French cotignac.\nIn Hungary, quince cheese is called birsalmasajt, and is prepared with small amounts of lemon zest, cinnamon or cloves and often with peeled walnut inside. P\u00e9ter Melius Juh\u00e1sz, the Hungarian botanist, mentioned quince cheese as early as 1578 as a fruit preparation with medical benefits.\nIn Vojvodina, it is sometimes prepared with addition of finely grated walnut, hazelnut or pumpkin seeds. Sometimes a certain amount of sugar would be replaced by an equal amount of linden honey.\nHawthorn pudding\nList of spreads\nThirteen desserts\nLekvar\nGoiabada\nBocadillo\nJeremy A.

The origin of the pastry is uncertain but there are several opinions where it comes from. One theory assumes that it was a pastry shop in the Medieval Ages in Andalusia called \"Flor de Castilla\" that first sold a pastry under the name \"Yemas de Santa Teresa\".\nDon Isabelo S\u00e1nchez, founder of the pastry shop \"La Dulce Aviles\" (nowadays known as \"Flor de Castilla\") in \u00c1vila commercialized the pastry in 1860 under the name \"Yemas de Santa Teresa\". The success of the dish was great and other pastry chefs in \u00c1vila soon started to sell similar pastries which they called \"Yemas de \u00c1vila\".\nAnother theory credits the monks of the convent of Teresa of \u00c1vila with the invention of the dish.\nWith the beginning of the 21st century the market for \"Yemas de \u00c1vila\" expanded and they are now on demand in North America.\nTherefore, a new packaging system was developed to improve the preservation and make them survive the shipping to America.\nThis pastry is made exclusively with egg yolks which are stirred in copper bowls. Meanwhile, syrup is cooked with lemon juice and cinnamon to reduce it until it is a dense mixture. The consistency can be proven by dipping a spoon into the syrup and is right when the sticky liquid keeps connected with the spoon by a thin thread.\nAs soon as the syrup reduction is gooey enough it is mixed with the egg yolks and stirred with them at a low heat. The pastry dough is left to cool and is then moulded into the special kind of balls with a few centimetres diameter and put into the tartlet papers.\nList of Spanish desserts\nSerna Estrella (5 February 2014). \"Yema: The Origins of a Classic Filipino Candy\".

Other variants of Philippine barquillos include those flavored with ube, pandan leaves, and carrots, which are bright purple, green, and orange in color, respectively.\nIn Hong Kong, biscuit rolls are made of wheat flour, butter, egg, sugar, and vanilla flavour.\n\nCucurucho\nPizzele\nWaffle\nSemprong\nFortune cookie\nKuih kapit\n\"Cookie Roll\". biscuit people.

George Washington Carver (1864-1943), an American agricultural extension educator, from Alabama's Tuskegee Institute, was the most well known promoter of the peanut as a replacement for the cotton crop, which had been heavily damaged by the boll weevil. He compiled 105 peanut recipes from various cookbooks, agricultural bulletins and other sources. In his 1925 research bulletin called How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it for Human Consumption, he included three recipes for peanut cookies calling for crushed or chopped peanuts.\nIt was not until the early 1930s that peanut butter was listed as an ingredient in the cookies.\nEarly peanut butter cookies were either rolled thin and cut into shapes, or else they were dropped and made into balls; they did not have fork marks. The first reference to the famous criss-cross marks created with fork tines was published in the Schenectady Gazette on July 1, 1932. The Peanut Butter Cookies recipe said: \"[s]hape into balls and after placing them on the cookie sheet, press each one down with a fork, first one way and then the other, so they look like squares on waffles.\"\nPillsbury, one of the large flour producers, popularized the use of a fork in the 1930s. The Peanut Butter Balls recipe in the 1933 edition of Pillsbury's Balanced Recipes instructed the cook to press the cookies using fork tines. These early recipes do not explain why the advice is given to use a fork, though. The reason is that peanut butter cookie dough is dense, and unpressed, each cookie will not cook evenly. Using a fork to press the dough is a convenience of tool; bakers can also use a cookie shovel (spatula).\nPeanut butter blossom cookie (peanut butter cookie with Hershey's kiss in center)\nList of cookies\nList of peanut dishes\n\u00a0Food portal\nPeanut Butter Cookies(www.NewEnglandRecipes.org)\nhttp://plantanswers.tamu.edu/recipes/peanutrecipes.html Archived March 5, 2007, at the Wayback Machine plantanswers.tamu.edu\nCooks.com's Peanut Butter Cookie Recipes - A wide assortment of recipes\nGeorge Washington Carver. \"How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it for Human Consumption,\" Tuskegee Institute Experimental Station Bulletin 31, 1916.\nAndrew F.

Cantuccio is an old Italian word that literally means \"little place\", \"nook\", or \"corner\" but that, in the past, was also used to indicate a little piece of bread with a lot of crust (usually the first and last slices of the loaf, the \"corners\").\nThe word biscotto, used in modern Italian to refer to a biscuit (or cookie) of any kind, originates from the medieval Latin word biscoctus, meaning \"twice-cooked\". It characterised oven-baked goods that were baked twice, so they became very dry and could be stored for long periods of time. Such non-perishable food was particularly useful during journeys and wars, and twice-baked breads were a staple food of the Roman legions.\nThe word biscotto, in this sense, shares its origin with the British-English (via Old French) word \"biscuit\", which refers to what American-English-speakers call a \"cookie\". In modern Italian, the word biscotto refers to any cookie or cracker, just as does the British use of the word \"biscuit\" (the number of bakings and the degree of hardness are not relevant to the term). In other countries, the term \"biscotti\", used as a singular, refers only to the specific Italian biscuit known in Italy as cantuccio.\n\nAlthough commonly used to indicate the biscuits of Prato, biscotti di Prato, in modern Italy and Argentina they are also known widely by the name \"cantuccini\". These names actually suggest other similar regional products of Italy. The term cantuccini is most commonly used today in Tuscany, but originally refers to variations or imitations which deviate from the traditional recipe in a few key points such as the use of yeasts, acids (to make them less dry) and flavourings. Rusks are larger, longer biscuits, rustic bread dough enriched with olive oil and anise seeds.\nThe confusion on the name may have been born from the fact that on the old sign (still present) of \"Biscottificio Antonio Mattei,\" the leading manufacturer of biscuits of Prato, is written just below the name of the shop: \"Manufacturers of cantuccini,\" which at the time were one of the major products of the biscuits. The sign has remained unchanged, and after such a long time people are accustomed to associate the name \"cantuccini\" with the biscuits typical of Sardinia and Sicily.\nThe Old French word bescoit passed into the English language as \"biscuit\", although in English as in Italian \"biscuit\" does not refer specifically to a twice-baked biscuit.\nIn France, a similar biscuit is known as croquant.\nIn Spain and France, the Catalan carquinyoli (Catalan:\u00a0[k\u0259\u027eki\u02c8\u0272\u0254li], plural carquinyolis) is made with whole or sliced almonds and is also associated with several Catalan-speaking territories. In Batea, La Fatarella, and Prat de Comte, all inland municipalities of Catalonia, and in the Terra Alta, they are also called carquinyols.\nBiscotti are traditional also in some inland towns in Valencia, where they are called rosegons or roseg\u00f3s. In Menorca, carquinyols are square shaped and do not include whole almonds. One Catalan food writer states that carquinyoli is derived from the French croquignole. Croquignole, another name for these biscotti, is a French word of Germanic origin.\nIn North America, where \"biscuit\" has taken on other meanings, any twice-baked biscuits are likely to be known as biscotti.\nFollowing rediscovery of the original recipe by Prato pastry chef Antonio Mattei in the nineteenth century, his variation is what is now accepted as the traditional recipe for biscotti. Mattei brought his cakes to the Exposition Universelle of Paris of 1867, winning a special mention.\nThe mixture is composed exclusively of flour, sugar, eggs, pine nuts, and almonds that are not roasted or skinned. The traditional recipe uses no form of yeast or fat (butter, oil, milk). The barely wet dough is then cooked twice: once in slab form, and again after cutting in sliced form, with the second baking defining how hard the biscotti are.\nTraditionally in Italy, biscotti di Prato are sold together with another sweet speciality of Prato, the bruttiboni. Served after dessert, they are usually combined with orange juice.\nToday the regional variations of the original are still adhered to, but the modern mass-manufactured biscotti are in fact closer to cantuccini, variations of biscotti.\nModern biscotti recipes often contain nuts (traditional almonds, pine nuts, pistachios, and hazelnuts are popular choices) or spices such as anise or cinnamon.\nModern recipes include adding baking powder and spices to the flour. The nuts are then added to allow them to be coated, with the skins being left particularly when using almonds and hazelnuts.",

Rice has been grown in southern Italy since the 14th century, and its cultivation eventually reached Milan in the north. While according to a legend, a young glassblower's apprentice of the Fabbrica del Duomo di Milano from Flanders, who used to use saffron as a pigment, added it to a rice dish at a wedding feast, the first recipe identifiable as risotto dates from 1809. It includes rice saut\u00e9ed in butter, sausages, bone marrow, onions with hot broth with saffron gradually added. There is a recipe for a dish named as a risotto in the 1854 Trattato di cucina ('Treatise on Cooking') by Giovanni Vialardi, assistant chief chef to kings. However, the question of who invented the risotto in Milan remains unanswered today.\nThe rice varieties now associated with risotto were developed in the 20th century, starting with Maratelli in 1914.\nA high-starch (amylopectin), low-amylose round medium- or short- grain white rice is usually used for making risotto. Such rices have the ability to absorb liquids and to release starch and so they are stickier than the long grain varieties. The principal varieties used in Italy are Arborio, Baldo, Carnaroli, Maratelli, Padano, Roma, and Vialone Nano. Carnaroli, Maratelli (historical Italian variety) and Vialone Nano are considered to be the best (and most expensive) varieties, with different users preferring one over another. They have slightly different properties. For example, Carnaroli is less likely than Vialone Nano to get overcooked, but the latter, being smaller, cooks faster and absorbs condiments better. Other varieties such as Baldo, Originario, Ribe and Roma may be used but will not have the creaminess of the traditional dish; these varieties are considered better for soups and other non-risotto rice dishes, and sweet rice desserts. Rice designations of superfino, semifino and fino refer to the size and shape (specifically the length and the narrowness) of the grains, and not the quality.\nThere are many different risotto recipes with different ingredients, but they are all based on rice of an appropriate variety, cooked in a standard procedure. Risotto, unlike other rice dishes, requires constant care and attention. The rice is not to be pre-rinsed, boiled, or drained, as washing would remove much of the starch required for a creamy texture.\nThe rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and butter or olive oil, to coat each grain in a film of fat, called tostatura; white wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has been absorbed the heat is raised to medium high, and boiling stock is gradually added in small amounts, while stirring constantly. The constant stirring, with only a small amount of liquid present, forces the grains to rub against each other and release the starch from the outside of the grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured mass. When the rice is cooked the pot is taken off the heat for mantecatura, vigorously beating in refrigerated balls of grated parmesan cheese and butter, to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible. It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier and left to cook with its residual heat.\nProperly cooked risotto is rich and creamy even if no cream is added, due to the starch in the grains. It has some resistance or bite (al dente) and separate grains. The traditional texture is fairly fluid, or all'onda (\"wavy, or flowing in waves\"). It is served on flat dishes and should easily spread out but not have excess watery liquid around the perimeter. It must be eaten at once, as it continues to cook in its own heat, making the grains absorb all the liquid and become soft and dry.\nMany variations have their own names:\nPaella\nPilaf\nList of Italian dishes\nList of rice dishes\nrisotto, Online Etymology Dictionary.

Served after dessert, they are usually combined with orange juice.\nToday the regional variations of the original are still adhered to, but the modern mass-manufactured biscotti are in fact closer to cantuccini, variations of biscotti.\nModern biscotti recipes often contain nuts (traditional almonds, pine nuts, pistachios, and hazelnuts are popular choices) or spices such as anise or cinnamon.\nModern recipes include adding baking powder and spices to the flour. The nuts are then added to allow them to be coated, with the skins being left particularly when using almonds and hazelnuts.",

The name \"macaroon\" comes from the Italian maccarone or maccherone meaning \"paste\", referring to the original almond paste ingredient; this word itself derives from ammaccare, meaning \"to crush\".\nCulinary historians write that macaroons can be traced to an Italian monastery of the 8th or 9th century. The monks came to France in 1533, joined by the pastry chefs of Catherine de' Medici, wife of King Henry II. Later, two Benedictine nuns, Sister Marguerite and Sister Marie-Elisabeth, came to Nancy seeking asylum during the French Revolution. The two women paid for their housing by baking and selling macaroons, and thus became known as the \"Macaroon Sisters\".\nItalian Jews later adopted macaroons because it has no flour or leavening (macaroons are leavened by egg whites) and can be eaten during the eight-day observation of Passover. It was introduced to other European Jews, and became popular as a year-round sweet.\nRecipes for macaroons appear in recipe books at least as early as 1725 (Robert Smith's Court Cookery, or the Complete English Cook), and use egg whites and almond paste. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management includes a typical traditional recipe. Over time, coconut was added to the ground almonds and, in certain recipes, replaced them. Potato starch is also sometimes included in the recipe, to give the macaroons more body.\n\nMacaroons in the Dominican Republic are very dark. Grated coconut is mixed with ginger and cinnamon.\nThere are many regional variations of French macaroon. The coconut macaroon is known as the \"Congolais\", or \"le rocher \u00e0 la noix de coco\".\nMandelh\u00f6rnchen (Almond crescents) are a common treat in Germany. Made of a similar flour to the macaroon's, they are formed to resemble a crescent, then covered in sliced almonds and dipped in chocolate.\nThoothukudi in Tamil Nadu and Mangaluru in Karnataka have their own varieties of macaroon made with cashews and egg whites, adapted from those introduced in colonial times.\nA macaroon chocolate bar is made by Wilton Candy in Co. Kildare. The description on the packaging is \"macaroon pieces in Irish milk chocolate.\" It was first made in 1937. Cleeve's Irish Confectionery also make a macaroon chocolate bar, with ingredients including cocoa butter, milk powder and desiccated coconut.\nRicciarelli are a soft almond variety originating from Siena. Amaretti di Saronno are a usually crunchy variety from Saronno.\nBoth are often served on special occasions such as Christmas.\nPhilippine coconut macaroons are uniquely cake-like in texture. They are slightly crunchy on the outside and soft, moist and chewy on the inside. They are usually baked into small, colourful cupcake wrappers and topped with a raisin. They are popular during holidays and special occasions.\nIn Puerto Rico, coconut macaroons are called besitos de coco (little coconut kisses).  A few variations of besitos de coco can be found on the island, the most popular ones including lemon zest and vanilla as additional ingredients.\nThe carajito is a macaroon variant made with hazelnuts and honey from the town of Salas, Asturias in northern Spain. A larger size version is commonly known as sultana or suspiros del moro.\nAc\u0131badem kurabiyesi is a traditional Turkish variety made of almonds, sugar and egg whites. The traditional recipes include a small amount of bitter almonds, which gives this macaroon its name. Because bitter almonds are not readily available, almond extract is typically used as a substitute. These are part of the stock-in trade of almost every bakery in Turkey, as they are seldom made at home.\nIn the UK generally, the traditional almond macaroon often includes almond essence to strengthen the flavour, and is topped with an almond flake. Coconut macaroons are also popular.\nIn Scotland, the Scottish macaroon has a dense, sugary centre and is covered in chocolate and roasted coconut. Traditionally they were made with cold leftovers of mashed potatoes and sugar loaf. When the macaroon bar became commercial the recipe no longer used mashed potato because of shelf life limitations. The modern macaroon is made from a combination (depending on producer) of sugar, glucose, water and egg white. These ingredients make a fondant centre. This recipe was reportedly discovered by accident in Coatbridge in 1931, when confectioner John Justice Lees was said to have botched the formula for making a chocolate fondant bar and threw coconut over it in disgust, producing the first macaroon bar.\nMacaroon chocolate bars are also popular in Scotland. Buchanan's make a macaroon with Belgian chocolate and toasted coconut. They are a long-established family business based in Greenock.  Scottish Macaroon is made with a paste of",

The earliest known mention of ravioli appears in the personal letters of Francesco di Marco Datini, a merchant of Prato in the 14th century. In Venice, the mid-14th-century manuscript Libro per cuoco offers ravioli of green herbs blanched and minced, mixed with beaten egg and fresh cheese, simmered in broth and seasoned with \"sweet and strong spices\".

Maltese ravjul are stuffed with irkotta, the locally produced sheep's-milk ricotta, or  with gbejna, the traditional fresh sheep's-milk cheese.\nTraditionally, ravioli are made at home. The filling varies according to the area where they are prepared. In Rome and Latium the filling is made with ricotta cheese, spinach, nutmeg and black pepper. In Sardinia, ravioli are filled with ricotta and grated lemon rind.\nModern ravioli are also mass-produced by machine.\nIn Europe and the United States, fresh-packed ravioli have several weeks of shelf life. Canned ravioli were pioneered by the Italian Army in the First World War and were popularized by Heinz and Buitoni in the UK and Europe, and Chef Boyardee in the United States. Canned ravioli may be filled with beef, processed cheese, chicken, or Italian sausage and served in a tomato, tomato-meat, or tomato-cheese sauce. Toasted ravioli (ravioli that have been breaded and deep fried) was developed in St. Louis, Missouri, and is a popular appetizer and snack food.\nRavioli are commonly encountered in the cooking of Nice, the broader C\u00f4te d'Azur, and the surrounding regions in the south of France. The contents of these vary greatly, but most idiosyncratic to the region is the use of leftover daube meat.  Miniaturized cheese-filled ravioli, locally called ravioles, are a specialty of the Dr\u00f4me department in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, particularly the commune of Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re, and are frequently served au gratin.\nRavioli filled with halloumi are a traditional pasta dish of Cypriot cuisine. They are boiled in chicken stock and served with grated halloumi and dried mint on top.\nIn Turkey, Mant\u0131 which is similar to ravioli is a popular dish. It is stuffed with spiced meat and served with paprika sauce and yoghurt. Similar dishes in China are the jiaozi or wonton.\nIn India, a popular dish called gujiya is similar to ravioli. However, it is prepared sweet, with a filling of dry fruits, sugar, and a mixture of sweet spices, then deep fried in vegetable oil. Different stuffings are used in different parts of India. The dish is a popular food prepared during festivals all over the country.\nJewish cuisine has a similar dish called kreplach, a pocket of meat or other filling, with an egg pasta based covering. It is simmered in chicken soup. In that method of preparation it appears to be the direct descendant or inspiration of the original dish, which was simmered in \"broth\".

Cream of Wheat is an American brand of farina, a type of breakfast porridge mix made from wheat middlings. It looks similar to grits, but is smoother in texture since it is made with ground wheat kernels instead of ground corn. It was first manufactured in the United States in 1893 by wheat millers in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The product made its debut at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Before January 2007, Cream of Wheat was a Nabisco brand made by Kraft Foods.

The use of garlic and onion in Filipino cuisine have been influenced by the Spaniards who sauted these ingredients to enrich the flavors of their meals.

Bicol Express, known natively in Bikol as sinilihan (lit.\u2009'spiced with chili'), is a popular Filipino dish which was popularized in the district of Malate, Manila but made in traditional Bicolano style. It is a stew made from  long chili peppers (siling haba in Tagalog) or small chili peppers (siling labuyo in Tagalog), coconut milk/coconut cream (kakang gata in Tagalog), shrimp paste (bagoong alamang in Tagalog) or stockfish, onion, pork, ginger and garlic. The dish was termed by Laguna resident, Cely Kalaw, during a cooking competition in the 1970s in Malate, Manila. The name of the dish was inspired by the Bicol Express railway train (Philippine National Railways) that operated from Tutuban, Manila to Legazpi, Albay (regional center of the Bicol region). The widely-known name for this dish in the Bicol Region of the Philippines was identified as gulay na may lada, which is currently one of the vegetarian variants of the Bicol Express dish. As time progressed, variants of the Bicol Express dish expanded with seafood, beef, pescatarian, vegetarian, vegan, and other versions. The preparations for these dishes vary according to the meat present within the dish. The nutritional value of the original version of the Bicol Express dish is beneficial in protein but unhealthy in regards to its high levels of saturated fats and cholesterol. The dish has moved into food processing and commercial production so that it can be sold conveniently and stored for a longer period of time.\nSee Bicol for full etymology. The name derives originally from the spelling systems of Spanish and then integrated with the spelling systems of English. There were three types of Spanish derivatives of Bicol; 'Vicor', 'Vicol', & 'Bico', because the Spanish did not distinguish /b/ and /v/ in their pronunciation.\n\nThe Bicol Express dish had been formally termed by Laguna native, Cely Kalaw, as a result of her cooking competition experience in the 1970s at Malate, Manila. She created this new dish in response to her customers' high interests for a spicy and sizzling Taro dish. While trying to determine a name for the dish, Kalaw's brother heard the sound of the Philippines National Railway traveling across Kalaw's restaurant to arrive Manila. This event inspired Kalaw to name the dish 'Bicol Express' after the PNR train that is programmed to undergo the Manila-Legazpi route.\nPrior to Kalaw's formal terminology of the Bicol Express dish, a similar Ilocano meal to this dish was recognised as 'gulay na may lada' in the regions of Bicol, Philippines. Gulay na may lada is a vegetarian variant of the dish that consists of exactly the same ingredients as the Bicol Express dish, except it lacks the meat components of the meal (pork chunks & shrimp paste). There is a Bicolano influence in the creation of the Bicol Express as Kalaw's upbringing is situated in the regions of Bicol. This upbringing provided her with the knowledge about creating Bicolano cuisines and lead to the inspiration and construction of her Bicol Express dish in Malate, Manila.\nDuring the 1960s, the Bicol Express dish was created and sold by people in the Bicol Region despite a lack of name for the dish. Bicolanos would wait at the Sipocot station, Camarines Sur, for a train to make a temporary stop and they would start selling the dish to the passengers. The dish was stored in a plastic bag and the rice was wrapped in a bundle of taro leaves. The dish's convenient set up allowed it to be easily sold and spread across the region of Bicol. However, food selling on trains became prohibited on the PNR train lines and so the dish's relevance diminished over time until Kalaw was able to reintroduce and popularise the dish in her restaurant at Malate, Manila.\nThe ingredients of coconut and chili peppers are predominant in dishes originating from the Bicol community. Both of these ingredients are endemic across the provinces of Bicol. There are over 50 million coconut bearing trees in Bicol. This makes the Bicol Region the most prosperous region in the Philippines to contain this enormous amount of coconut bearing trees. The region also meets the criteria for highly suitable wet conditions for coconut growing zones.\nSiling Labuyo (small chili pepper) is commonly used in many Bicolano cuisines. Under the Scoville scale, the Scoville Heat Unit of the siling labuyo is 100,000 SHU and siling haba is 50,000 SHU but each of these chili peppers can vary depending on the conditions of their growing environments. The siling labuyo in Bicol is much spicier than the siling labuyo in Manila, which makes it one",

Bibingka (/b\u026a\u02c8bi\u02d0\u014bk\u0251\u02d0/; bi-BEENG-kah) commonly refers to a type of baked rice cake from the Philippines that is traditionally cooked in a terracotta oven lined with banana leaves and is usually eaten for breakfast or as merienda (mid-afternoon snack) especially during the Christmas season. \nIt can also be used as a general term referring to other Filipino baked rice cakes products, for example, those made with cassava flour (bibingkang cassava / bibingkang kamoteng kahoy), glutinous rice (bibingkang malagkit), or plain flour.\nBibingka is also found in East Timor and Christian communities in eastern Indonesia.\nThe shared origins of bibingka from the Philippines and Indonesia is widely acknowledged especially given that the Indonesian bibingka is from Eastern Indonesia, the regions closest to the Philippines with the most closely related cultures.\nSome authors have also proposed a connection between the Goan dessert bebinca (or bibik) and the Southeast Asian bibingka due to the similarity in names. They believe that the Portuguese may have introduced it to Southeast Asia from Goa. This is unlikely, however, given that the Philippines, where bibingka is most widely known, was never a colony of Portugal. The preparations of the dish are also very different; the Goan dessert is a type of layered coconut pudding similar to Filipino sapin-sapin and Indonesian kue lapis, meanwhile the Filipino bibingka is a baked glutinous rice cake. The only similarity to the two dishes is that bebinca and bibingka both use coconut milk.  Rice-based dishes are also far more diverse in Southeast Asia, where rice is an ancient Austronesian staple crop. \nThus it is more likely that the Portuguese introduced the term to Goa from the Philippines, rather than the other way around. Similar to how the art of windowpane oyster shell windows were also introduced from the Philippines to Goa (they are still called capiz in Goa after the Philippine province of Capiz).\nBibingka is a traditional Philippine Christmas food. It is usually eaten along with puto bumb\u00f3ng as a snack after attending the nine-day Simbang Gabi ('Night mass', the Filipino version of Misa de Gallo) and, therefore, it is commonly found sold near the vicinity of churches. In the municipalities of Baliuag and San Miguel, Bulacan, bibingka is sold along with a complimentary serving of fresh salabat.\nAs of October 9, 2007, the town of Dingras, Ilocos Norte in the Philippines is expecting a Guinness World Records certification after baking a kilometer-long cassava bibingka made from 1,000 kilos of cassava and eaten by 1,000 residents.\nBibingka has a texture ranging from a soft spongy texture similar to puto, another Philippine rice cake, to a soft but firm texture. It is eaten hot or warm and is slightly sweet with a taste very similar to rice pudding. The top and bottom surfaces (including the traditional banana leaf lining) are also usually charred, adding to the flavor. The regular size of bibingka can be sliced or torn into several wedges and is enough to serve 3 to 4 people while some establishments also offer smaller-sized bibingka for individual consumption.\nBibingka is also used as a general term for desserts made with flour and baked in the same manner. The term can be loosely translated to \"[rice] cake\". It originally referred primarily to bibingka galapong, the most common type of bibingka made with rice flour. Other native Philippine cakes have also sometimes been called bibingka. These may use other kinds of flour, such as corn flour, cassava flour, or plain flour, and are usually considered separate dishes altogether. Some variations of bibingka differ only from the type of toppings they use. The common types of bibingka are listed below:\nBibingka galap\u00f3ng is the traditional form of bibingka made from ground soaked glutinous rice (galap\u00f3ng), water, and coconut milk.\nBibingkang malagk\u00edt is a moist version of bibingka, typically served sliced into square blocks. It commonly also includes slices of ripe jackfruit (langka) and topped with latik (coconut caramel) and grated coconut. It is very similar to biko, except that it is baked and uses galapong instead of whole grain.\nBibingkang Mandaue (Mandaue-style Bibingka) are bibingka from Mandaue, Cebu. It is traditionally made with tub\u00e2 (palm wine) which gives it a slightly tart aftertaste. Nowadays, tub\u00e2 is often substituted with yeast.\nBibingkoy - a unique variant from Cavite which has a filling of sweetened mung beans and served with a sauce of coconut cream, jackfruit, and sago. It is very similar to mache, but is baked instead of steamed.\nBuko bibingka - Bibingka baked with slivers of young coconut flesh (buko).\nCassava cake is made",

It is made from egg yolks, sugar, and flavourings such as honey, vanilla, cocoa or rum, similar to eggnog or zabaione. In its classic form it is served slightly chilled or at room temperature. Served warm or hot, it is considered a home remedy for sore throats. Variations include milk, honey and soda.\nKogel mogel became known by this name by the 17th-century Jewish communities of Central Europe. It may have its roots in the Jewish code of law called the Shulchan Arukh where one is allowed to consume sweet syrup and/or raw egg on Shabbat to make one's voice more pleasant.\nVasmer's dictionary mentions different hypotheses on the origin of the name such as English hug-mug, hugger-mugger, or German Kuddelmuddel.\nThe dessert was made popular during the communist era food shortages, including sugar. It is still eaten in Poland and in Polish communities around the world.\nKogel mogel is often prepared as a transition food for babies moving from a cereal diet to one that includes eggs and other soft foods. It is also a folk medicine used for treating colds or flu, particularly chest colds and laryngitis. Kogel mogel is ranked highly among other traditional cold remedies such as chicken soup. \nThe traditional usage of kogel mogel as a home remedy for treating a sore throat is supported by research done in Israel. The simplest form of preparation as a remedy is with no egg, but only honey added to warm milk.  More commonly, a single raw egg is added to a cup of warm milk and mixed with a tablespoon of honey.\nIn the German translation of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Humpty Dumpty is called Goggelmoggel.\nIn the 1985 film of Doctor Aybolit from the Soviet Union, Doctor Aybolit nurses sick pirates and animals back to health by giving them kogel mogel.\nKogel-mogel is a Polish 1988 comedy of manners film directed by Roman Za\u0142uski, starring Gra\u017cyna B\u0142\u0119cka-Kolska and Ewa Kasprzyk.\nA similar sounding phrase, Great Googly Moogly, an apparent euphemism for \"Great God Almighty,\", appears in a Howlin' Wolf song, \"Goin' Down Slow\", and in the work of Langston Hughes, and was later more generally popularized by Frank Zappa and Mr. Magoo.\nuovo sbattuto\u00a0\u2013 Italian breakfast\nEggnog\nRompope\u00a0\u2013 Eggnog-like drink from Latin America\nAdvocaat\u00a0\u2013 Dutch alcoholic beverage featuring eggs\nZabaione, also known as Zabaglione\u00a0\u2013 Italian dessert made with egg, sugar, and wine\nCoquito\u00a0\u2013 Puerto Rican rum and coconut milk cocktail\nEierpunsch\u00a0\u2013 Warm, sweetened alcoholic, egg-based drink\nList of custard desserts\u00a0\u2013 Wikipedia list article\nList of desserts\u00a0\u2013 Wikipedia list article\nPonche crema\u00a0\u2013 Cream liqueur from Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago\nFloating island\u00a0\u2013 Dessert made with meringue and cr\u00e8me anglaise\nPrevention, Alternative Health, Bubbes Remedies, Jewish Genetic Diseases, Jewish Medical Ethics\nPetrosian, Irina; David Underwood (2006).

Cream of Wheat is an American brand of farina, a type of breakfast porridge mix made from wheat middlings. It looks similar to grits, but is smoother in texture since it is made with ground wheat kernels instead of ground corn. It was first manufactured in the United States in 1893 by wheat millers in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The product made its debut at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Before January 2007, Cream of Wheat was a Nabisco brand made by Kraft Foods. In January 2007, B&G Foods acquired the brand and all rights to market the cereal. \"Cream of Wheat\" is a registered trademark.\nThe rice-based Cream of Rice also forms part of the product line, and is often a recommended early food for infants and toddlers and for people who cannot tolerate wheat or gluten, such as persons with celiac disease.\nAfter the Panic of 1893, the Diamond Milling Company in Grand Forks was faced with low prices and reduced demand for flour. The head miller proposed that the company package a breakfast porridge that his wife would make from the portion of the wheat not used in making flour. The company sent samples of the hand-packaged product with its regular orders of flour, and soon received a telegram that said \"Never mind shipping us anymore of your flour, but send us a carload of Cream of Wheat.\" \nDiamond Milling directed its factory to begin manufacturing only Cream of Wheat. As demand increased, the company moved to a new factory in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1897, and changed its name to Cream of Wheat Company.\nThe original boxes of Cream of Wheat were handmade and lettered, and were emblazoned with the image of an African American chef produced by Emery Mapes. The character was named Rastus and was developed by artist Edward V. Brewer. Rastus was included on all boxes and advertisements. It has long been thought that a chef named Frank L. White was the model for the chef shown on the Cream of Wheat box\u2014a claim White himself made. White's headstone contains his name and an etching taken from the man depicted on the Cream of Wheat box.\nLeading up to 2020, there had been public pressure aimed at various companies to change branding with perceived racist origins, such as Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben's. The character of Rastus had once been depicted as a cook who was barely literate and did not know about vitamins. Rastus is also a derogatory term traditionally associated with African Americans in the United States. For these reasons, B&G Foods had been under public pressure for years to make changes.\nPublic demands to remove symbols of racism increased during the 2020 protests around racism.

The word kaymak has Central Asian Turkic origins, possibly formed from the verb kaymak, which means 'melt' and 'molding of metal' in Turkic. The first written records of the word kaymak is in the well-known book of Mahmud al-Kashgari, D\u012bw\u0101n Lugh\u0101t al-Turk. The word remains as kaylgmak in Mongolian, which refers to a fried clotted cream, and with small variations in Turkic languages as qaymaq in Azerbaijani, qaymoq in Uzbek, \u049b\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u049b in Kazakh and Shor, \u043a\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u043a in Kyrgyz, kaymak in Turkish, ga\u00fdmak in Turkmen, \u10d9\u10d0\u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10e6\u10d8 (kaimaghi) in Georgian, \u03ba\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 (ka\u00efm\u00e1ki) in Greek, and \u043a\u0430\u0458\u043c\u0430\u043a (kajmak) in Serbo-Croatian.\nShops in Turkey have been devoted to kaymak production and consumption for centuries. Kaymak is mainly consumed today for breakfast along with the traditional Turkish breakfast. One type of kaymak is found in the Afyonkarahisar region where the water buffalo are fed from the residue of poppy seeds pressed for oil. Kaymak is traditionally eaten with baklava and other Turkish desserts, fruit preserve and honey or as a filling in pancakes.\nKnown as kajmak, it is almost always made at home, though there is beginning to be commercial production. Kajmak is most expensive when freshest\u2014only a day or two old. It can keep for weeks in the fridge but becomes harder and loses quality. Kajmak can also be matured in dried animal skin sacks; one variation is called skorup. Kajmak also describes the creamy foam in the Turkish coffee, and a lot of other coffees in the Balkans.\nIt is usually enjoyed as an appetizer or for Saturday morning breakfast, as Saturdays are market days with the best kajmak, but also as a condiment. The simplest recipe is lepinja sa kajmakom pita bread filled with kajmak in Serbia) consumed for breakfast or as fast food. Bulgarians, Bosnians, Montenegrins and Serbs consider it a national meal. Other traditional dishes with kajmak (sold in restaurants) include pljeskavica sa kajmakom (the Balkan version of a hamburger patty topped with melted kajmak), as well as ribi\u0107 u kajmaku (beef shank, simmered with kajmak).\nIn Iraq, it is called qeymer or qeimer (\u0642\u064a\u0645\u0631) and is very popular. Iraqi qeymer is usually made from the rich fatty milk of cows or buffaloes, which are prevalent in the marshes of southern Iraq.\nIt is available both factory-produced and from local vendors or farmers as qeymer Arab.\nIraqis like to serve qeymer for breakfast with fresh bread, honey or jam.  However, the most popular way is to spread it on a type of Iraqi pastry bread called kahi, smother it with date honey and then wash it down with hot tea.  Qeymer on kahi with date syrup or honey is a long-standing traditional breakfast in Baghdad and throughout southern and northern Iraq.\n\nIn Afghanistan, qaimak or qaymaq has a thinner quality and is eaten for breakfast meals usually with bread. People typically top qaimak with honey, sugar, or mix it with jam. It can be spread on pastries or even added to milk tea. Qaimak can be purchased at grocery stores in Afghanistan or made at home. It is quite a long process to make at home, involving hours stirring the milk pot. Qaimak can be found at Afghan/Iranian grocery stores in the west, but is not as rich as homemade. While a lot qaimak variations are made from buffalo milk, Afghan qaimak can be made from cows' milk.\nIn the Adjara region of Georgia, bordering Turkey, \u10d9\u10d0\u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10e6\u10d8 (kaimaghi) is made from cow's milk in homes in the mountainous municipalities of Keda, Shuakhevi, and Khulo. It is typically eaten with Georgian cheese and/or bread, and is only rarely served in restaurants.\nKa\u00efmaki (\u03ba\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9) in Greece refers to mastic-flavored ice cream that is widely available and often served alongside traditional desserts.\nMalai\n\"Polish Chocolate and Dulce de Leche Mazurek\".

                "description": "According to the classic recipe, shucked oysters are wrapped in bacon which is then broiled in the oven, about three minutes per side. An early recipe, from 1902, suggests frying the skewered oysters and bacon in butter. The dish is often served on toast, though if prepared on skewers and broiled, it can be eaten straight from the skewer. Variations on the preparation and presentation of the angels on horseback vary considerably. In Feng Shui Food, it is prepared by rolling a shucked oyster in bacon and skewering it with a cocktail stick, fried and served with a squeeze of lime. ...",

Angels on horseback is a hot hors d'\u0153uvre or savoury made of oysters wrapped with bacon. The dish, when served atop breads, can also be a canap\u00e9.\nThe dish is typically prepared by rolling shucked oysters in bacon and baking them in an oven. Modern variations of angels on horseback include skewering and frying. Serving can vary widely to taste on either skewers or breads, with additional accompaniments or condiments. Angels on horseback differ from the similar, fruit-based, devils on horseback, but the dishes' names are sometimes erroneously considered synonyms.\nAngels on horseback can be served as an hors d'\u0153uvre, as a canap\u00e9, or as a savoury. Angels on horseback are canap\u00e9s when served with breads. In England, they are traditionally served as savouries; salty or savoury items served after the dessert meant to cleanse the palate before the serving of digestifs. One cookbook including angels on horseback as a savoury is the 1905 Savouries Simplified, by Constance Peel.\nAngels on horseback should not be confused with devils on horseback. The latter dish, which is derived from the former, uses fruit, typically prunes or dates. American and British chefs including Martha Stewart and Martin Blunos recognise the distinction between the dishes, and though food writer John Ayto does too, he notes that the names have often been used interchangeably. This has been traced to a Chicago Tribune article and James Beard who \"insisted that angels on horseback required ham as a wrapper, and that if bacon were used, what you'd have would be devils on horseback.\"\nThe origins of the dish are unclear. The name most likely derives from the French anges \u00e0 cheval, and there appears to be no significance in the oyster/angel and bacon/horse links. Its first occurrence, according to the Oxford English Dictionary and other sources, is in 1888, in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. However, there is a reference in an Australian newspaper to the dish, which includes a brief recipe, from 1882.\nReferences to angels on horseback in the United States date to the mid- to late 1890s. One of the earliest references in an American newspaper is an 1896 article from The New York Times, where the dish is suggested as an appetizer; according to the Times, the dish is to be credited to Urbain Dubois, the chef of the German Emperor, then Kaiser Wilhelm II. In this version, the angels on horseback are skewered, sprinkled with cayenne pepper, and broiled. The article suggests serving the dish with lemon and parsley, but without toast. In the 1930s, they are suggested as part of a picnic menu, and in 1948 again as an appetizer. In the 1950s, American newspapers featured the dish with interest, from papers including the Chicago Tribune, with the articles \"For Oyster Treat, Try Angels on Horseback: They're Delectable Appetizer Sunday Menu\", and \"These Angels on Horseback Are Oysters\", and the Los Angeles Times.\nAngels on horseback did achieve a certain popularity in the 1960s in Washington, D.C.; Evangeline Bruce, wife of US ambassador and diplomatic envoy David K. E. Bruce and renowned for her \"Washington soirees\", served them regularly during the Kennedy administration but even there, the name itself was not commonplace, as suggested by the words of gossip columnist Liz Smith: \"Sometimes the oysters were raw, sometimes they were grilled and wrapped in bacon. Then Mrs. Bruce called them Angels on Horseback.\" As late as the 1980s, the Chicago Tribune published an article calling the dish \"intriguing\", suggesting it had not yet become commonplace in the United States.\nPublications from the 1990s onwards discuss angels on horseback as an indulgence or a delicacy with frequency. 1001 Foods to Die For noted it as an indulgence in North America due to the elevation of oysters to a delicacy status. The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink noted that the luxury of oysters results in cocktail sausages replacing the oysters.\nIn the James Bond novel Doctor No, Ian Fleming writes of Bond ordering a dinner in the lair of the title character that includes angels on horseback.\nBacon wrapped food\nList of hors d'oeuvre\nOysters en brochette\n\"Angels on Horseback Recipe\".

Zh\u0101i (simplified Chinese: \u658b; traditional Chinese: \u9f4b; pinyin: zh\u0101i) means \"vegetarian food\" or \"vegetarian diet.\"\nThe dish is usually made with at least 10 ingredients, although more elaborate versions may comprise 18 or even 35 ingredients. If 18 ingredients are used, the dish is called Lu\u00f3h\u00e0n qu\u00e1nzh\u0101i (simplified: \u7f57\u6c49\u5168\u658b; traditional: \u7f85\u6f22\u5168\u9f4b).\nIn China and Hong Kong, when served exclusively using only the most flavor-packed vegetarian ingredients, such as pickled tofu or sweet bean curds, it is known as ti\u00e1n su\u0101n zh\u0101i (simplified Chinese: \u751c\u9178\u658b; traditional Chinese: \u751c\u9178\u9f4b; literally \"sweet and sour vegetarian dish\").\nAs suggested by its name, it is a dish traditionally enjoyed by Buddhists, but it has also grown in popularity throughout the world as a common dish available in Chinese restaurants (though often not including all of the ingredients) as a vegetarian option. It is traditionally served in Chinese households on the first day of the Chinese New Year, stemming from the old Buddhist practice that one should maintain a vegetarian diet in the first five days of the new year, as a form of self-purification. Some of the rarer ingredients, such as fat choy and arrowhead, are generally only eaten at this time of year.\nTraditionally eggs and dairy are not permitted. \nAlliums and some other vegetables (w\u01d4 h\u016bn) are not used in Buddha's delight, as they are frowned upon in Buddhist cuisine.\n\nArrowhead (\u6148\u83c7 or \u8328\u83f0; pinyin: c\u00edg\u016b)\nBamboo fungus (\u7af9\u7b19, pinyin: zh\u00fash\u0113ng or \u7af9\u836a; pinyin: zh\u00fas\u016bn)\nBamboo shoots (simplified: \u7b0b; traditional; \u7b4d; pinyin: s\u01d4n)\nBean curd sticks (\u8150\u7af9; pinyin: f\u01d4zh\u00fa; also called \"tofu bamboo\")\nBlack mushrooms (\u51ac\u83c7; pinyin: d\u014dngg\u016b)\nCarrot (traditional: \u80e1\u863f\u8514; simplified: \u80e1\u841d\u535c, pinyin: h\u00fa lu\u00f3bo; or traditional: \u7d05\u863f\u8514; simplified: \u7ea2\u841d\u535c, pinyin: h\u00f3ng lu\u00f3bo)\nCellophane noodles (\u7c89\u7d72; pinyin: f\u011bns\u012b; also called \"bean threads\")\nDaylily buds (\u91d1\u9488; pinyin: j\u012bnzh\u0113n; also called \"golden needles\")\nFat choy (traditional: \u9aee\u83dc; simplified: \u53d1\u83dc; pinyin: f\u00e0c\u00e0i; a black hair-like cyanobacteria)\nGinkgo nuts (traditional: \u9280\u674f; simplified: \u94f6\u674f, pinyin: y\u00ednx\u00ecng;  or \u767d\u679c, pinyin: b\u00e1igu\u01d2)\nLotus seeds (\u84ee\u5b50; pinyin: li\u00e1nz\u01d0)\nNapa cabbage (\u5927\u767d\u83dc; pinyin: d\u00e0 b\u00e1ic\u00e0i)\nPeanuts (\u82b1\u751f; pinyin: hu\u0101sh\u0113ng)\nSnow peas (traditional: \u8377\u862d\u8c46; simplified: \u8377\u5170\u8c46; pinyin: h\u00e9l\u00e1n-d\u00f2u)\nFried tofu (\u70b8\u8c46\u8150; pinyin: zh\u00e1 d\u00f2uf\u01d4)\nWater chestnuts (traditional: \u8378\u85ba; simplified: \u8378\u8360; pinyin: b\u00edq\u00ed)\nFried or braised wheat gluten (traditional: \u9eb5\u7b4b, simplified: \u9762\u7b4b; pinyin: mi\u00e0nj\u012bn)\nWood ear (\u6728\u8033; pinyin: m\u00f9 \u011br; also called black fungus)\nBean sprouts (\u8c46\u82bd, pinyin: d\u00f2uy\u00e1; \u82bd\u83dc, pinyin: y\u00e1c\u00e0i; or \u94f6\u82bd, pinyin: y\u00edny\u00e1)\nBracken fern tips (\u8568\u83dc; pinyin: ju\u00e9c\u00e0i)\nBok choy (\u767d\u83dc; pinyin: b\u00e1ic\u00e0i)\nCauliflower (\u83dc\u82b1; pinyin: c\u00e0i hu\u0101)\nChinese celery (\u82b9\u83dc; pinyin: q\u00edn c\u00e0i)\nOther types of fungus, including cloud ear fungus (traditional: \u96f2\u8033; simplified: \u4e91\u8033; pinyin: y\u00fan \u011br), elm ear fungus (\u6986\u8033; pinyin: y\u00fa \u011br), osmanthus ear fungus (\u6842\u82b1\u8033; pinyin: gu\u00edhu\u0101 \u011br), snow fungus (\u94f6\u8033; pinyin: y\u00edn \u011br), and yellow fungus (\u9ec3\u8033; pinyin: hu\u00e1ng \u011br; literally \"yellow ear\") See also: List of Chinese mushrooms and fungi.\nRed jujubes (traditional: \u7d05\u68d7; simplified: \u7ea2\u67a3; pinyin: h\u00f3ng z\u01ceo)\nLotus root (\u85d5; pinyin: \u01d2u)\nOther types of mushrooms, including straw mushrooms (\u8349\u83c7, pinyin: c\u01ceog\u016b), oyster mushrooms (\u5e73\u83c7, pinyin: p\u00edngg\u016b), and Tricholoma mushrooms (\u53e3\u8611, pinyin: k\u01d2um\u00f3)\nPotato (\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af; pinyin: m\u0103l\u00edngsh\u01d4)\nLaminaria\nCornflower buds\nBaby corn\nGinger (simplified: \u59dc; traditional: \u8591; pinyin: ji\u0101ng)\nMonosodium glutamate (\u5473\u7cbe; pinyin: w\u00e8ij\u012bng)\nVegetable oil (usually peanut, \u82b1\u751f\u6cb9; and/or sesame, \u829d\u9ebb\u6cb9)\nVegetarian Oyster sauce (simplified: \u658b\u869d\u6cb9; traditional: \u9f4b\u8814\u6cb9; pinyin: zh\u0101i h\u00e1oy\u00f3u)\nPickled tofu (\u8c46\u8150\u4e73; pinyin: d\u00f2ufu r\u01d4; both red and white)\nSalt (traditional: \u9e7d; simplified: \u76d0; pinyin: y\u00e1n)\nDark soy sauce (\u8001\u62bd; pinyin: l\u01ceoch\u014du)\nStarch (\u6dc0\u7c89; pinyin: di\u00e0nf\u011bn)\nSugar (\u7cd6;",

Clams casino is a clam \"on the halfshell\" dish with breadcrumbs and bacon. Green peppers are also a common ingredient.\nIt originated in Rhode Island in the United States. It is often served as an appetizer in New England and is served in variations nationally.\nThe clams, bacon, and other ingredients are cooked in various ways depending on the recipe, and then added with breading to half the clam shell and baked or broiled (grilled from above) to a golden brown.\nThere are many variations on the dish, but the constant factor is the bacon: \"Bacon remains the major key to its success\", with some chefs recommending smoked bacon for its salty flavor and others advocating an unsmoked variety.\nAccording to legend, the recipe for clams casino was originally developed in 1917 in the Little Casino in Narragansett, Rhode Island, by a ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel for a woman of means wanting something special for her guests. Good Housekeeping Great American Classics attributes the dish to Mrs. Paran Stevens and ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel Julius Keller. She named the dish after the hotel, and word and popularity of the dish has since spread across the United States, including New Orleans, where oysters are substituted for clams. Clams casino remains a very popular dish in Rhode Island, \"appearing on almost every menu\".\nThe Central Park Casino was offering \"soft clams a la Casino\" as early as 1900.\nAccording to Merrill Shindler, \"in the first decades of this century [the 20th], if a restaurant wanted to be noted, it came up with a dish that involved the baking of shellfish\". While there was a profusion of this type of menu offering (often with the meat taken out of the shell, prepared with sauce, and returned to the shell), clams casino and oysters Rockefeller \"are among the few surviving dishes from the shellfish fad\".\nThe dish is popular with Italian-Americans, having \"a permanent spot on just about every trattoria menu\" in Little Italy, Manhattan, and is considered an American classic. Clams casino is often served at Italian festivals and during the holidays in the United States.\nClams oreganata\nList of bacon dishes\nList of clam dishes\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nList of seafood dishes\nRuth Reichl, John Willoughby, Zanne Early Stewart The Gourmet Cookbook: More Than 1000 Recipes Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2006 ISBN\u00a00-618-80692-X, 9780618806928\n1056 pages page 50 The Gourmet Cookbook\nZanger, Mark H.

These charms may be coins or small symbolic objects (e.g., a small piece of a dogwood branch with a bud, symbolizing health or longevity). More recently, people have started writing happy wishes on small pieces of paper and wrapping them in tin foil. Wishes may include happiness, health, or success throughout the new year (similar to fortune cookies).\nBanitsa is served for breakfast with plain yogurt, ayran, or boza. It can be eaten hot or cold. Some varieties include banitsa with spinach \"\u0441\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\" (spanachnik) or the sweet version, banitsa with milk \"\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430\" (mlechna banitsa) or pumpkin \"\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\" (tikvenik).\nThe word \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 derives from the South Slavic \u0433\u044a\u0431\u043d\u046b\u0442\u0438 meaning \"to fold.\"  The word developed from the Proto-Slavic form *\u0433\u044b\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 > *\u0433\u044a\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 > *\u0433\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 > \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430.\n\nTraditionally, banitsa is made with homemade or commercially made pastry sheets that are prepared from a baker's hard dough made of flour, water, and salt. At home the sheets can be spread by continuously pulling the sheet of dough with one's fingers until it becomes less than a millimeter thin, or by using a rolling pin in several stages with sunflower oil  sprinkled between the partially spread leaves, or by a very difficult technique comprising waving movements of the entire sheet over the head of the cook, which resembles pizza dough making techniques. Commercially available sheets are mechanically spread and somewhat dried before packing.\nAnother sort of banitsa is called tutmanik (\u0442\u0443\u0442\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a) or poparnik (\u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a) and is made with leavened sheets. The usual filling is cheese.\nThe traditional filling is made of crushed white cheese (sirene, feta cheese), yogurt, and eggs. Sometimes baking soda is added to the yogurt, which makes it rise (as the baking soda reacts with the acid in yogurt). The addition of baking soda results in a fluffier filling.\nVegetable fillings include spinach, sorrel, docks, mangold, chards, beet leaves, nettles, leaves of the radishes, leeks, onions and green part of spring onions, parsley, cabbage or sauerkraut. All these variants, including cabbage, are called zelnik (\u0437\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043a), from the word \u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d (zelen) 'green'. The leek variant is called praznik (\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a) and onion variant is called luchnik (\u043b\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a).\nIn some regions of Bulgaria, the filling is made with rice. There are also meat fillings with minced meat, onions, and mushrooms. Sweet fillings with apples (similar to apple pie or strudel) or pumpkin with sugar, walnuts and cinnamon exist as well. In some regions, only the walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon are used. The apple variant is called shtrudel (\u0449\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043b), and the pumpkin variant is tikvenik (\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a).\nModern take on Banitsa with milk is made by baking the leaves soaked in milk with sugar, eggs and vanilla.\nIn Bulgaria, banitsa is a symbol of Bulgarian cuisine and traditions.\nTraditionally, Bulgarians prepare and serve banitsa on two holidays\u00a0\u2013 Christmas and New Year's Eve. On these days, people add kusmeti (literally lucks, meaning fortunes, lucky charms) into the banitsa. The charms are usually small pieces of dogwood branch, which vary in numbers of buds on them. They symbolize health and longevity. The branches are hidden inside the banitsa, and the banitsa is then baked. When ready, the banitsa is cut to as many pieces as the members of the family are and each piece contains a dogwood branch. Two additional pieces of banitsa are cut - one for the house and another one for Virgin Mary who is the protector of the family. A wish is associated with each branch and the different number of buds on the branch helps to recognize the corresponding wish. The wishes include happiness, health, success, travel, etc. The banitsa is then spun on the table and everyone takes the piece which is in front of them when the spinning stops. Then they find their fortune inside the piece\u00a0\u2013 the fortunes predict what one is to expect from the new year. The most common fortunes are \"health\", \"love\", \"marriage\", \"baby\", \"journey\", \"wealth\", etc.\nAlternatively or in addition to the kusmeti, some add a coin or simply little pieces of paper with written fortunes on them (just like the ones in the fortune cookies). In this case, they are wrapped in tin foil to preserve them during baking.\nThe word \"banitsa\" is used",

Maja de ube. Maja blanca (literally \"white maja\" in Spanish; Tagalog:\u00a0[\u02c8maha \u02c8bla\u014bka]) is a Filipino dessert with a gelatin-like consistency made primarily from coconut milk. Also known as coconut pudding, it is usually served during fiestas and during the holidays, especially Christmas.\nMaja blanca has the consistency of thick gelatine and a delicate flavor, and is creamy white in color.\nThe dessert is the local Filipino adaptation of the Spanish dish manjar blanco (blancmange), but it has become distinct in that it uses very different ingredients, like coconut milk instead of milk or almond milk. The dish was most popular in Luzon, especially in Tagalog, Kapampangan, Pangasinense, and Ilocano cuisine. But it was also popular in the south, especially among Chavacano-speaking Zamboangue\u00f1os.\nMaja blanca takes its name from the flamboyant majas of 18th- and 19th-century Spanish society. Maja blanca is also known as dudul in Ilocano; as well as maja blanca con ma\u00edz, maja ma\u00edz, or maja blanca ma\u00edz when corn kernels are used in the preparation (ma\u00edz is Spanish for corn).\nMaja blanca can easily be adapted to include various other ingredients, often resulting in changes in the color of the dish. Examples include squash maja blanca which uses calabazas (Filipino: kalabasa) and a version of maja maiz that uses butter, resulting in a distinctive yellow color.\nOther common variants include maja de ube (or maja ube), a deep purple variant of maja blanca which uses ube (purple yam); and maja buko pandan a light green variant which is flavored with pandan leaves and coconut meat.\nMaja blanca is prepared similarly with tibok-tibok without the corn kernels.\nEspasol\nHaupia\nLeche flan\nList of dishes using coconut milk\nManjar blanco\nManjar branco\nPhilippine cuisine\nSapin-sapin\nEdgie Polistico (2017).

The cooked slices may be served with sugar or sweet toppings such as jam, honey, fruit, or maple syrup.",

French toast is a dish made of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and typically milk, then pan fried. Alternative names and variants include \"eggy bread\", \"Bombay toast\", \"gypsy toast\", and \"poor knights\" (of Windsor).\nWhen French toast is served as a sweet dish, milk, sugar, vanilla or cinnamon are also commonly added before pan-frying, and then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered sugar), butter, fruit, or syrup. When it is a savory dish, it is generally fried with a pinch of salt or pepper, and it can then be served with a sauce such as ketchup or mayonnaise.\nThe earliest known reference to French toast is in the Apicius, a collection of Latin recipes dating to the 1st century CE, where it is described as simply aliter dulcia (\"another sweet dish\"). The recipe says to \"Break [slice] fine white bread, crust removed, into rather large pieces which soak in milk [and beaten eggs] fry in oil, cover with honey and serve\".\nA 14th-century German recipe uses the name Arme Ritter (\"poor knight\"), a name also used in English and the Nordic languages. Also in the 14th-century, Taillevent presented a recipe for \"tost\u00e9es dor\u00e9es\". Italian 15th-century culinary expert Martino da Como offers a recipe.\nThe usual French name is pain perdu (French:\u00a0[p\u025b\u0303 p\u025b\u0281dy] (listen), \"lost bread\", reflecting its use of stale or otherwise \"lost\" bread \u2014 which gave birth to the metaphoric term pain perdu for sunk costs. It may also be called pain dor\u00e9, \"golden bread\", in Canada. There are fifteenth-century English recipes for pain perdu.\nAn Austrian and Bavarian term is pafese or pofese, from zuppa pavese, referring to Pavia, Italy. The word \"soup\" in the dish's name refers to bread soaked in a liquid, a sop. In Hungary, it is commonly called bund\u00e1skeny\u00e9r (lit. \"coated bread\").\nAccording to the Compleat Cook (1659) as quoted in the OED, the bread was dipped in milk only, with the egg mixture added afterwards.\nAlternatively, the bread may be soaked in wine, rosewater, or orange juice, either before or after cooking.\n\nIn both Portugal and Brazil, rabanadas are a traditional Christmas dessert. Many recipes often use Tinto or Port wine.\nIn Denmark, Arme Riddere (Poor Knights) is a sweet breakfast dish, that can also be eaten as an afternoon treat or evening dessert. The Danish version of this dish uses sugar with cinnamon, instead of plain sugar.\nIn France, pain perdu has a wide range of regional variations.\nIn Germany, Arme Ritter (Poor Knights) or Pofesen are at least known since the 14th century (mentioned in Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch (The German Dictionary) by the Brothers Grimm).\nHong Kong-style French toast (Chinese: \u897f\u591a\u58eb; Cantonese Yale: s\u0101id\u014ds\u00ed; lit. 'western toast') is typically prepared by combining multiple slices of bread with peanut butter or fruit jam filling, then dipping in beaten egg and deep frying. It is served with butter, and topped with golden syrup or honey. It is a typical offering in Hong Kong teahouses (cha chaan teng). Other types of filling that can be found are meat floss, kaya jam, ham, or beef satay.\nIn India, Bombay toast is a dish sold on the \"streets of Mumbai\" by hawkers and vendors, Bombay toast is also called Sweet French Bread.\nIn Norway, Arme Riddere (Poor Knights). Once only a dessert dish, it is now eaten for brunch or breakfast. Most common spices are cinnamon and cardamom.\nIn Romania it is known as frig\u0103nele and, almost always, served as a savory dish, and, often enough, without milk, although milk can be requested at most dinners.\nFrench Toast is a familiar menu item in the famous Hawker centres of Singapore sold traditionally as part of a breakfast set with local soft boiled eggs or a dollop of Kaya.\nTorrija is a similar recipe traditionally prepared in Spain for Lent and Holy Week. It is usually made by soaking stale bread in milk or wine with honey and spices. It is dipped in beaten egg and fried with olive oil. This cooking technique breaks down the fibres of the bread and results in a pastry with a crispy outside and smooth inside. It is often sprinkled with cinnamon as a final touch.\nTorrijas or torrejas were first mentioned by the Spanish composer, poet and playwright Juan del Encina (1468\u20131533) in his Cancionero, published in 1496. \"Anda ac\u00e1 pastor\" has the verse \"En cantares nuevos/ gocen sus orejas,/ miel y muchos huevos/ para hacer torrejas,/ aunque sin dolor/ pari\u00f3 al Redentor\".\nIn the UK, it is commonly known as French toast, or occasionally as eggy bread or Gypsy toast and is served as both a sweet and as a savory dish.\nFrench toast was popularly served in railroad dining cars of the early and mid-20th century. The Santa Fe  was especially known for its French toast, and most of the railroads provided recipes",

                "description": "Castella (, kasutera) is a kind of wagashi (a Japanese traditional confectionery) originally developed in Japan based on the \"Nanban confectionery\" (confectionery imported from abroad to Japan during the AzuchiMomoyama period). The batter is poured into large square or rectangular molds, baked in an oven and cut into long rectangular shapes. Since the recipe calls for mizuame, a type of sugar syrup, Castella has a moist texture. Now a specialty of Nagasaki, the cake was brought to Japan by Portuguese merchants in the 16th century. The name is derived from Portuguese Po de Castela, meaning \"bread from Castile\". Castella cake is usually sold in long boxes, with the cake inside being approximately 27cm long. ...",

In the 16th century, the Portuguese reached Japan and soon started trade and missionary work. Nagasaki was then the only Japanese port open for foreign commerce. The Portuguese introduced many then-unusual things, such as guns, tobacco, and pumpkins. The cake could be stored for a long time, and so was useful for the sailors who were out on the sea for months. In the Edo period, in part due to the cost of sugar, castella was an expensive dessert to make despite the ingredients sold by the Portuguese. When the Emperor of Japan's envoy was invited, the Tokugawa shogunate presented the Castella. Over the years, the taste changed to suit Japanese palates.\nThere are now many varieties made with ingredients such as powdered green tea, brown sugar, and honey. They may be molded in various shapes; a popular Japanese festival food is baby castella, a bite-sized version.\nSiberia, castella cake filled with youkan (sweet bean jelly), was popular in the Meiji era; it had a resurgence since it appeared in the  2013 animated film The Wind Rises, by Hayao Miyazaki.\nCastella mix is used for the pancakes that are sandwiched together with sweet adzuki bean paste in the confection known as dorayaki.\nCastella were first introduced to Taiwan during the age of Taiwan under Japanese rule. In 1968, Ye Yongqing, the owner of a Japanese bakery in Taipei named Nanbanto, partnered with the Japanese company Nagasaki Honpu to establish a castella business. \nTaiwanese style castella is generally more souffl\u00e9-like than the Japanese variety with a custard like center. A speciality of Tamsui is a simple pillow shaped castella cake. Taiwanese style castella has been introduced into Japan.\nGairaigo\nJapanese words of Portuguese origin\nChen, Namiko (2013-09-14). \"Castella Cake (Video) \u30ab\u30b9\u30c6\u30e9\".

A club sandwich, also called a clubhouse sandwich, is a sandwich of bread (traditionally toasted), sliced cooked poultry, ham or fried bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise. \nIt is often cut into quarters or halves and held together by cocktail sticks. Modern versions frequently have two layers which are separated by an additional slice of bread.\nThe club sandwich may have originated at the Union Club of New York City. The earliest known reference to the sandwich, an article that appeared in The Evening World on November 18, 1889, is also an early recipe: \"Have you tried a Union Club sandwich yet? Two toasted pieces of Graham bread, with a layer of turkey or chicken and ham between them, served warm.\"  Several other early references also credit the chef of the Union Club with creating the sandwich.\nAnother theory is that the club sandwich was invented at the Saratoga Club in Saratoga Springs, New York, after Richard Canfield bought it and made it into the Canfield Casino in 1894. \nOther sources find the origin of the club sandwich to be up for debate.\nThe sandwich appeared on U.S. restaurant menus as early as 1899. The earliest reference to the sandwich in published fiction is from Conversations of a Chorus Girl, a 1903 book by Ray Cardell. Historically, club sandwiches featured slices of chicken, but with time, turkey has become increasingly common. An 1897 recipe has three layers, with the chicken and ham separated not by a slice of bread, but by a lettuce leaf.\nDagwood sandwich\nList of sandwiches\nBreene, Sophia (March 19, 2013). \"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the Club Sandwich\".

A substantial dish prepared with meat and vegetables, it is most popular during the winter but is served throughout the year in some restaurants. Initially it was a dish for humble people, but it started to climb in society thanks to its inclusion in restaurant menus. The chickpea was included in the Cartago age, and later it was used in medieval age in Spain. \nIt is a dish normally eaten in winter, in the cold months of the year.\nThe origins of the dish are uncertain, but most sources agree that probably it was created during the Middle Ages as an evolution of the Sephardic dish adafina. Long-cooking dishes were indispensable for Jews as they allowed hearty meals during Shabbat. These first versions were kosher, using eggs and without pork. Within time, adafina was soon popular elsewhere.\nThe growth of anti-Semitism and the Inquisition during the 15th and 16th centuries modified the dish substantially, as the fear of being denounced as Jewish forced Christians and Marranos (converted Jews) alike to prove themselves as Christians by incorporating pork into their meals. Soon lard, bacon, chorizo (pork sausage) and morcilla (blood sausage) were added to the dish.\nFrom these origins, the recipe allowed few modifications and was soon established as a staple of Madrid cuisine. During the growth of the city in the 19th and 20th centuries, its low cost and heartiness made it a popular order in small restaurants and the taverns catering to manual workers. After the Civil War, the austerity period, followed by the introduction of more convenient meals, reduced the public popularity of the dish.\nTradition rules that the ingredients of cocido must be served separately. Each serving is known as a vuelco (tipping or emptying out), as at each time the pot must be emptied out to separate the ingredients.\nThe first vuelco is to separate the stock of the cocido and serve it with noodles added. The second vuelco consists of chickpeas and vegetables. The third vuelco is the meat dish.\nTraditionally, dishes made with the leftovers of the cocido include Spanish croquetas (croquettes), ropa vieja and pring\u00e1.\nCocido lebaniego\nCocido monta\u00f1\u00e9s\nCozido \u00e0 portuguesa\nFabada asturiana\nList of stews\nSpanish cuisine\nDaft, Rohan (2008).

It is one of the most popular desserts in Puerto Rican cuisine.\nIt is a holiday dish, served on New Year's Day throughout the island of Puerto Rico. While the recipe may have originated in Puerto Rico, there are variants on the dish in Latin America and other countries. In Brazil, the dish is known as manjar branco. According to the Encyclopedia of Puerto Rico, published by the Foundation for the Humanities, each time a Puerto Rican migrant to the United States comes closer and closer to forgetting their roots, foods like tembleque bring them back and remind them who they are, reminds them of their island and of their grandmother.\nIn Spanish, the word tembleque is an adjective used to describe something that shakes or a noun, to describe the shakes themselves. The dessert,  due to its Jell-O-like, gel texture trembles, shivers, shakes, and that is what the finished dessert does, when prepared correctly.\nTembleque, a reggaeton song by Jon Erik, describing the movement of tembleque, the dessert, and tembleque, the dance move\nCoconut bar\nKhanom thuai\nBebinca\nHaupia\n\"Puerto Rican Coconut Pudding\".

In 1899, Charlie Thompson, a Bassett's sales representative, supposedly tripped over and dropped a tray of samples he was showing a client in Leicester, mixing up the various sweets. After he scrambled to re-arrange them, the client was intrigued by the new creation.  Quickly the company began to mass-produce the allsorts and they became a successful product.\nBassett's have released two varieties of allsorts that do not feature any liquorice. Fruit Allsorts feature mixed-fruit flavoured sweets, while Dessert Allsorts have flavours such as apple tart and lemon cheesecake.  Both retain the shapes and textures of the original sweet. Red allsorts, with fruit-flavoured liquorice, were briefly released in the late 1990s, discontinued and later reintroduced to the UK with flavours including Blueberry Cube, Strawberry Check, and a red liquorice \"Betty Bassett\".\nThe original items mixed by Thompson were \"chips, rocks, buttons, nuggets, plugs and twists\". It is not clear which, if any, correspond to Bassets traditional allsorts, though certainly newer items have been introduced, such as the Bertie.\nThe Bassett's company mascot is Bertie Bassett, a figure made up of liquorice allsorts, which has become a part of British popular culture. The character's origins lie with advertising copywriter Frank Regan, who used the sweets and a number of pipe-cleaners to construct what was the original version of Bertie. One of the sweets in the modern day allsorts mix is a liquorice figure shaped like Bertie.\nThe Doctor Who television serial episode The Happiness Patrol featured a villain called the Kandy Man, who was made from liquorice allsorts and was thought by some to resemble Bertie Bassett. Although an internal investigation concluded that the programme had not infringed on Bassett's trademark, the BBC promised Bassett's that the Kandy Man would not appear again.\nIn the 2001 satirical comedy film Mike Bassett: England Manager, the figure of Bertie Bassett appears in a short scene on a newspaper with the headline \"Bassett's Allsorts\".\nAs a publicity stunt, Bassett's staged a mock wedding between actors dressed as Bertie and Betty Bassett, another character composed of confectionery, at its Sheffield factory, in February 2009.\nDolly Mixtures\nCadbury's, Our Brands: Bassett's\n\"Sweet new bride for Bertie at 80\".

Chikanda is a Zambian dish made from the boiled root tubers of terrestrial orchids also called chikanda. The dish is often called \"African polony\" because it has a texture that resembles bologna. Chikanda can be eaten as a snack, dessert, or an accompaniment to nshima, a maize flour porridge.\nChikanda has been eaten for hundreds of years by people in parts of Zambia, northern Malawi, and southwestern Tanzania. The dish is traditionally associated with the Bemba tribe in northeast Zambia, although it is eaten throughout Zambia today. For the Bemba, it is an integral part of the culture and is served at special occasions such as weddings. Originally a food in the setting of rural scarcity, it has now shifted to an urban trend.  Now, chikanda can be found being sold by street vendors, supermarkets, and large restaurants as the urban population has an increased demand for this rural tradition.\nIn Malawi, it is thought that eating the dish will protect against sickness.\nIn southwestern Tanzania, a similar dish called kinaka in Kiswahili are eaten by the Nyamwanga, Nyika, Nyiha, Fipa, Lungu, and Ndali.\nThe tubers are dried and pounded. Then, a mixture of the dried brown orchid meal and groundnut meal are boiled to form a slurry. Dried chili peppers can also be added. The slurry is thickened by soda, salted, and flavored with spices. As it simmers, the slurry thickens into a cake and rises like dough. It is usually served sliced.\nThe orchid roots grow wild throughout Zambia. However, due to the high demand, this had led to the present scarcity of the orchids in the country. Now, they are illegally imported from Tanzania, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, leading to the risk of overharvesting abroad. Traditional sustainability practices included only harvested tubers that have spread their seed and replanting stalks. However, the locals have abandoned these practices due to increased demand. Unfortunately, the orchids are difficult to cultivate in captivity. Current efforts for conservation focus on cultivating the threatened orchids.\nA similar issue with unsustainable harvesting of orchids is noted with the Turkish trade in salep, a starch used in dessert and beverages.\nJoshi, D.D.

Green bean casserole is a baked dish consisting primarily of green beans, cream of mushroom soup, and french fried onions. The recipe was created in 1955 by Dorcas Reilly at the Campbell Soup Company. It is a very popular side dish for Thanksgiving dinners in the United States and has been described as iconic. As of 2020 Campbell's estimated it was served in 20 million Thanksgiving dinners in the US each year and that 40% of the company's cream of mushroom soup sales go into a version of the dish.\nCampbell\u2019s Cream of Mushroom flavored soup variety was created in 1934 and was the first of the company's soups to be marketed as a sauce as well as a soup. It became so widely used as casserole filler in recipes for the hotdish recipes popular in Minnesota that it was sometimes referred to as \"Lutheran binder.\" Like other food companies, Campbell's employed recipe developers to create recipes using their products as part of their marketing strategy.\nDorcas Reilly (1926\u20132018) created the recipe in 1955 while working in the home economics department at the Campbell's Soup Company. The recipe was created for a feature article for the Associated Press; the requirement was for a quick and easy dish using ingredients most US households kept on hand. \nIt was called \"Green Bean Bake\" when the recipe began being printed on soup cans. Initially the dish did not test well within the company but, in part because of Reilly's persistence, eventually earned a reputation for being \"the ultimate comfort food.\" Culinary historian Laura Shapiro called the recipe's use of the crunch fried onion topping was a \"touch of genius\" that gave an otherwise ordinary convenience-food side dish a bit of \"glamour\".\nFood & Wine called it iconic, and Good Housekeeping said that \"few dishes are as iconic\" as the green bean casserole.\nIt was originally marketed as an everyday side dish but became popular for Thanksgiving dinners in the 1960s after Campbell's placed the recipe on the can's label. The recipe popularized the combination of the soup with green beans. Campbell's Soup now estimates that 40 percent of the Cream of Mushroom soup sold in the United States goes into making green bean casserole. As of 2020 Campbell's estimated it was served in 20 million Thanksgiving dinners in the US each year. Campbell's in 2020 reported their online version of the recipe is viewed 4 million times each Thanksgiving Day. According to Campbell's as of 2018, the recipe is the most popular ever developed in their kitchens. Campbell's has estimated that 40% of its cream of mushroom soup sales become ingredients in a green bean casserole. \nFolklorist Lucy Long in 2007 noted that its inclusion on Thanksgiving dinner tables crosses ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious differences. She also notes it is included in most popular American cookbooks, mentioned in the media regularly, and referred to a \"classic\", \"traditional\", and \"a Thanksgiving standard\". She wrote that the popularity of the dish was related to its categorization as a casserole, which in the US is associated with \"communal eating, sharing, and generosity\" and that the green bean casserole in particular represents the familiar and also the festive.\nIn November of 2002, Reilly, representing Campbell's, donated the original recipe card to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio. The donation was followed by a meal featuring the dish. Reilly died 15 October 2018, at the age of 92 in her hometown of Camden, New Jersey.\nList of casserole dishes\nMarketing\nLong, Lucy (Spring 2007). \"Green Bean Casserole: The Logic of a Midwestern Foodways Aesthetic\".

Chikanda is a Zambian dish made from the boiled root tubers of terrestrial orchids also called chikanda. The dish is often called \"African polony\" because it has a texture that resembles bologna. Chikanda can be eaten as a snack, dessert, or an accompaniment to nshima, a maize flour porridge.\nChikanda has been eaten for hundreds of years by people in parts of Zambia, northern Malawi, and southwestern Tanzania. The dish is traditionally associated with the Bemba tribe in northeast Zambia, although it is eaten throughout Zambia today. For the Bemba, it is an integral part of the culture and is served at special occasions such as weddings. Originally a food in the setting of rural scarcity, it has now shifted to an urban trend.  Now, chikanda can be found being sold by street vendors, supermarkets, and large restaurants as the urban population has an increased demand for this rural tradition.\nIn Malawi, it is thought that eating the dish will protect against sickness.\nIn southwestern Tanzania, a similar dish called kinaka in Kiswahili are eaten by the Nyamwanga, Nyika, Nyiha, Fipa, Lungu, and Ndali.\nThe tubers are dried and pounded. Then, a mixture of the dried brown orchid meal and groundnut meal are boiled to form a slurry. Dried chili peppers can also be added. The slurry is thickened by soda, salted, and flavored with spices. As it simmers, the slurry thickens into a cake and rises like dough. It is usually served sliced.\nThe orchid roots grow wild throughout Zambia. However, due to the high demand, this had led to the present scarcity of the orchids in the country. Now, they are illegally imported from Tanzania, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, leading to the risk of overharvesting abroad. Traditional sustainability practices included only harvested tubers that have spread their seed and replanting stalks. However, the locals have abandoned these practices due to increased demand. Unfortunately, the orchids are difficult to cultivate in captivity. Current efforts for conservation focus on cultivating the threatened orchids.\nA similar issue with unsustainable harvesting of orchids is noted with the Turkish trade in salep, a starch used in dessert and beverages.\nJoshi, D.D.

Chikanda is a Zambian dish made from the boiled root tubers of terrestrial orchids also called chikanda. The dish is often called \"African polony\" because it has a texture that resembles bologna. Chikanda can be eaten as a snack, dessert, or an accompaniment to nshima, a maize flour porridge.\nChikanda has been eaten for hundreds of years by people in parts of Zambia, northern Malawi, and southwestern Tanzania. The dish is traditionally associated with the Bemba tribe in northeast Zambia, although it is eaten throughout Zambia today. For the Bemba, it is an integral part of the culture and is served at special occasions such as weddings. Originally a food in the setting of rural scarcity, it has now shifted to an urban trend.  Now, chikanda can be found being sold by street vendors, supermarkets, and large restaurants as the urban population has an increased demand for this rural tradition.\nIn Malawi, it is thought that eating the dish will protect against sickness.\nIn southwestern Tanzania, a similar dish called kinaka in Kiswahili are eaten by the Nyamwanga, Nyika, Nyiha, Fipa, Lungu, and Ndali.\nThere are many different species of orchids used, but primarily from the Disa, Habenaria, and Satyrium genera. Researchers determined that 16 orchid species in 6 genera are in the chikanda trade. The orchid roots resemble the shape of an Irish potato but is smaller in size. The ash water or baking soda with their high pH likely provides supplemental minerals and leads to the soapy taste and firm texture of chikanda.\nThe orchid roots grow wild throughout Zambia. However, due to the high demand, this had led to the present scarcity of the orchids in the country. Now, they are illegally imported from Tanzania, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, leading to the risk of overharvesting abroad. Traditional sustainability practices included only harvested tubers that have spread their seed and replanting stalks. However, the locals have abandoned these practices due to increased demand. Unfortunately, the orchids are difficult to cultivate in captivity. Current efforts for conservation focus on cultivating the threatened orchids.\nA similar issue with unsustainable harvesting of orchids is noted with the Turkish trade in salep, a starch used in dessert and beverages.\nJoshi, D.D.

Red chillies, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, cloves and cinnamon are roasted in a dry pan till the aroma is felt. This is cooled. Ginger, garlic and roasted spices are ground into a paste with the vinegar.  Oil is heated, the prawns are added and stir-fried till opaque. Next, the pan is used to fry onions. Once onions are light brown, tomatoes are added and fried till soft.  Spice-vinegar paste is added, with sugar and salt. This is fried till the oil begins to separate from the masala, prawns are added, and the mix is cooked for 2-3 minutes.\nBalch\u00e3o is usually served with hot, plain boiled rice. It can also be refrigerated, and will keep for a long time in the fridge.\nBalch\u00e3o was introduced to India by the Portuguese during colonization, most likely from Malacca (today Melaka).\nCatholic homes may use coconut vinegar for its acidic sharpness, while Hindu families may use cane vinegar to make it milder. It is now common to use white vinegar or malt vinegar.\nGoan cuisine\nKonkani cuisine\nList of pork dishes\nList of seafood dishes\n\u00a0Food portal\n\"Pickle Style Dry Goan Prawns\".

The Natchitoches meat pie is a regional dish from northern Louisiana, United States. It is one of the official state foods of Louisiana.\nIn the modern recipe, ground pork or pork sausage is blended into the ground beef for additional flavor.  Onions, bell pepper and when used garlic and parsley provide aromatics. Ground black pepper and cayenne pepper are added to get attention without being uncomfortable. Flour is added to the browned meat and vegetable mixture to dry, thicken and loosely bind the filling. The meat filling can be used in other foods (e.g., tacos, tamales, enchiladas, stuffed bell pepper et al) but the wheat turnover crust is a defining element. The traditional size is approximately 4 ounces (by weight) on a 5\"-6\" diameter pastry dough (with the dough circles being cut, traditionally, using an empty coffee can). The filling should be made the day before to allow the flavors of the ingredients to meld. Filling, dough and tools should be chilled before assembly. Warm filling will cause the dough to disintegrate.\nIn the first part of the 20th century, meat pies were sold from home kitchens or from carts by street vendors. By 1967, Natchitoches meat pies were produced in commercial kitchens. Now, they may be ordered online.\nLouisiana Public Broadcasting aired a program January 20, 2007, describing how to make Natchitoches meat pies. It is available on DVD entitled \"A Taste of Louisiana with Chef John Folse & Company:  Our Food Heritage - The Spanish Shows\". An annual Meat Pie Festival, held in September, celebrates the Natchitoches meat pie. It includes pie making demonstrations, a meat pie cook-off, live music and more.\nCrawfish pie\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nPistolette\nLaws of Louisiana, LL 170.9, 2003.\n\"Report\". inside.sfuhs.org.\n\"Common Empanada Mistakes\".

Sup kambing or sop kambing is a Southeast Asian mutton soup, commonly found in Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore. It is prepared with goat meat, tomato, celery, spring onion, ginger, candlenut and lime leaf, its broth is yellowish in colour. Sup kambing is quite widespread as numbers of similar goat meat soup recipes can be found throughout Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. \nIn Indonesia, it is mostly associated with Malay of Medan, Betawi and Madurese cuisine, although it is also common in Java. Nevertheless, Javanese are more likely to cook their goat meat as tongseng or Javanese-style soupy gulai instead. Traditionally, sup kambing together with gulai and sate kambing are quite widespread during Eid al-Adha, as large amount of goat meat and offals being distributed among people.\nIn Malaysia, sup kambing is also associated with the Muslim Malaysian Indian community and believed to be of Indian origin. In Singapore, the dish is also associated with the Muslim Indian community of the island.\nDespite its wide popularity in Maritime Southeast Asia, the question of origin however, might be owed to the Arabs and Muslim Indian migrations into the region. Sup kambing is believed to be of Arab origin, brought by the influx of Arabs migrants into the Malay Archipelago between the 18th to 19th century, during colonial era. The Arabs settlers introduced and promoted goat, lamb and mutton as their preferred meat, thus several dishes influenced by Arab and Muslim Indian culinary traditions were introduced to Sumatra, Malay peninsula and Java. Around the same period, other mutton or goat-based dishes such as sate kambing, gulai kambing and tongseng also appeared in Java.\nThe early Arab immigrants settled in coastal towns of Sumatra and Java, and subsequently influenced the culture of native ethnic groups including Malays, the Betawis of Batavia (Jakarta), also Javanese and Madurese of East Java. The sup kambing was adopted by locals, and often linked to the Islamic festival of kurban (Eid al-Adha), where large numbers of cattle \u2013 including goats, are slaughtered and distributed among people. As the result, despite its Arab origin, today in Indonesia sup kambing is more associated with Malay, Madurese, and Betawi cuisine. Indonesian sup kambing uses carrot, tomato, and sometimes potato, which hints its European (possibly Portuguese or Dutch) influences. Tomato and potato are not available in Southeast Asia until European colonials brought them from the Americas around the 17th century. The sup kambing from Medan in North Sumatra however, is closer to the Malaysian version, since they commonly derived from Muslim Indian culture.\nIn Malay Peninsula region, which today includes Malaysia and Singapore, the most popular version is sup kambing Mamak which is believed to have been invented by the Muslim Indian community there, where the use of typical spices is quite notable. There is no exact equivalent of this soup in Indian sub-continent, although the spices used and the style of cooking clearly demonstrates Indian influence. The most famous sup kambing in Singapore is the sup tulang merah which was invented by Baharudeen, Abdul Hameed (mammaka) and Abdul Kadir who were migrants from a remote village Thopputhurai in Tamilnadu. These three shops are located at Jalan Sultan, Beach Road. The dish is also adopted by native Malays in both countries.\nIn Indonesia the soup is prepared in rich savoury broth with spices and ingredients similar to other Indonesian favourite, sop buntut (oxtail soup). Common sop kambing uses goat meat, also its ribs; however, in Indonesia there is a more specific sop kambing called sop kepala kambing which uses offals of goat's head, which includes its tongue, ear, lips and cheek meats, eyes and sometimes brain. Another specific sup kambing is called sop kaki kambing which uses goat's trotters.\nList of Indonesian soups\nMamak stall\nVarious Indonesian Sup Kambing recipes (in Indonesian)\nJakarta-Style Goat Feet Soup from Indonesia Eats\n\"40 of Indonesia's best dishes\".

Another specific sup kambing is called sop kaki kambing which uses goat's trotters.\nList of Indonesian soups\nMamak stall\nVarious Indonesian Sup Kambing recipes (in Indonesian)\nJakarta-Style Goat Feet Soup from Indonesia Eats\n\"40 of Indonesia's best dishes\".

Vor\u00ed vor\u00ed is a thick, yellow soup with little balls made of cornmeal, corn flour, and cheese very usual in Paraguay and zones of the North-East of Argentina.\nThe name \"vor\u00ed vor\u00ed\" comes from the Guarani language. In Guarani, one way of specifying abundance is by repetition of a word. So, \"vor\u00ed\" is one, but \"vor\u00ed vor\u00ed\" can be two or more.\nThe word \"vor\u00ed\", which names the dish is a derivation of the Spanish word \"bolita\" (\"little ball\", in allusion to the little corn balls found in the dish). The word passed into Guarani as \"borita\", (no 'l' in Guarani) and finally shortened to \"vor\u00ed\". Then, \"vor\u00ed vor\u00ed\" is \"bolita bolita\".\nVori vori is traditionally served during the cold winter months, to keep people warm; although it is eaten occasionally during the summer.\nThe corn flour and the crumbled cheese are put in a container, moistening this mixture with the fat broth until one has a mixture from which the little balls can easily be made by hand.\nEvery vor\u00ed should be the size of a big grape. Once there's enough little balls made, these are put in boiling soup and cooked for about 5 minutes. If the soup turns too thick, it can be thinned by adding more boiling water.\nThe traditional vor\u00ed vor\u00ed is also known as \"vor\u00ed vor\u00ed caldo\".\nOne of the most widespread recipes is the \"vor\u00ed vor\u00ed de gallina\", in which pieces of chicken previously grilled on its own fat are added to the soup.\nWhen the little balls are too small they're called \"tu'i rupi'a\" (the Guarani phrase for \"parakeet eggs\").\nThe vor\u00ed vor\u00ed is one of the few Paraguayan dishes that is eaten among every social layer. It's consumed also in fancy banquets as in the humble tables of rustic ranches.\nAccording to some scholars of social history of Paraguay, all the Paraguayan popular gastronomy, which establishes itself as a small family industry after the Paraguayan War against The Triple Alliance (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, between 1864 and 1870), is really abundant in caloric content, because of the situation that overcame to the country after the conflict. In the aftermath of the war, food was limited, groceries were hard to find. So Paraguayan cooking has a high protein content to make up for the scarcity of every day meal.\n\u201cTembi\u2019u Paraguay\u201d JOSEFINA VELILLA DE AQUINO\n\u201cKar\u00fa rek\u00f3 \u2013 Antropolog\u00eda culinaria paraguaya\u201d, MARGARITA MIR\u00d3 IBARS\n\"Guarani Fusion Kitchen\" Food Blog www.guaranifusionkitchen.com",

Hallaca is a Mesoamerican tamal-like dish that goes by various names and spread throughout the Spanish kingdoms in the Americas as far south as Argentina in the decades following the conquest. It is said to have been invented by slaves during the colonial era. The slaves would prepare the Christmas Eve meal for the landowners and with leftover meat they made the hallacas filling for their own Christmas meal. One version of the dishes origin tale has it that the daughter of the landowning family asked to taste the hallacas. She and her family liked the dish so much they requested for it to be made for their dinner party and ever since it has been part of the traditional holiday meal for all economic classes.\nAccording to Adolfo Ernst, the word hallaca evolved from the indigenous Guarani language, stemming from the verb ayua or ayuar, meaning \"to mix or blend\". From there, the construction ayuaca (mixed things) devolved to ayaca and ultimately to hayaca or hallaca (using Spanish silent \"h\" when written).  Another version presumes that the word comes from an aboriginal language of the West of the country, whose meaning is \"wrapping\" or \"bojote\". The earliest use of the word in the modern sense is in a 1781 document of Italian missionary linguist Filippo Salvatore Gilii.\nHallaca filling is more elaborate than the standard tamal filling. Ingredients differ from region to region and from family to family but may include a combination of beef, pork, bacon, lard, onion, sweet pepper, red pepper, scallion, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, cumin and some type of cooking wine or vinegar. In the version from the Venezuelan Andes hallacas are made with guiso crudo which differ from other versions because the meat filling is not pre-cooked. Some versions of the filling include leeks, Worcestershire sauce, mustard pickles, panela,  or dark brown sugar. The stew is simmered over low heat slowly for several hours. \nIn Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao, two islands just off the coast of Falc\u00f3n state, Venezuela, it is called 'ayaca' or 'ayaka'. The ingredients are pork and chicken stew, or pork or chicken stew, capers, raisins, cashews, bellpepper, pickled baby onions, prunes, and olives. The dough is made from white cornmeal, and the ayaca leaves first spread with lard or oil. Cooked meat and other ingredients are then wrapped in ayaca leaves, tied with string and then boiled for about 2 hours. Flavors in the ayaca vary from family to family, and some add Madam Jeanette peppers (very hot).\nIn Puerto Rican cuisine the dish is called hayaca and used to be a popular part of the island's cuisine. Unlike the Venezuelan variety, hayaca from Puerto Rico is not made with corn but with cassava, stock, milk, pork fat cooked with annatto, and banana leaf, and baked in traditional open-wood-fire. They are typically filled with diced pork butt brasied with sofrito, annatto oil (olive oil or lard), olives, capers, chickpeas, raisins, and spices. The liquid is then strained in to the masa. Because of the long and elaborate process and skills that takes to prepare, the hayaca is now rarely available but is still found, mostly in coastal, family-owned restaurants and other small establishments known as \"kioscos\" where there are still strong ties to native heritage and classic slow cooking skills.\nThe corn dough is similar to a standard arepas dough. Pork fat is melted down with annatto to add color. Corn flour is kneaded together with broth and some soft butter and the cooled pork fat mixture is incorporated to make a soft dough with a golden color. A large plantain leaf is greased with vegetable oil and the dough is flattened on the leaf to about a quarter inch thickness . The guiso filling is topped with a combination of onion, pepper, parsley, potatoes, raisins, almonds, chickpeas, capers, green olives, hard boiled eggs and bacon. The leaf is tied and boiled at a low heat.\nHallaca can be made in advance and frozen.\nHallaca is a staple of Venezuelan Christmas celebrations Christmas meals in Venezuela would include hallacas, pastries, pan de jam\u00f3n and chicken stew, but not all families have been able to afford them during food shortages in Venezuela. In 2014, despite food shortages affecting the country, the Venezuelan government created a hallaca with a length of around 400 feet, a Guinness World Record. In contrast to Venezuelan tradition, hallacas are popular year-round in Ecuador, and several variants exist across the country's different regions. Along with humitas, they are a staple of traditional Ecuadorian cuisine.\nFamilies usually gather in the morning to prep the",

In Europe, chorizo is a fermented, cured, smoked sausage, which may be sliced and eaten without cooking, or added as an ingredient to add flavor to other dishes. Elsewhere, some sausages sold as chorizo may not be fermented and cured, and require cooking before eating. Spanish chorizo and Portuguese chourio are distinctly different sausages, despite both getting their smokiness and deep red color from dried, smoked, red peppers (pimentn/pimento). ...",

The word chorizo probably comes from the Late Latin sals\u012bcia 'salted', via the Portuguese souri\u00e7o; it is a doublet of the Spanish word salchicha 'sausage', which was transmitted through Italian salsiccia.\nIn English, chorizo is usually pronounced /t\u0283\u0259\u02c8ri\u02d0zo\u028a, -so\u028a/, though sometimes the Castilian Spanish [\u03b8] sound is used: /t\u0283\u0259\u02c8ri\u02d0\u03b8o\u028a/.\nPronunciation and spelling vary slightly among the Iberian languages:\nAstur-Leonese: chorizu [t\u0283o\u02c8\u027ei\u03b8u]\nBasque: txorizo [t\u0283o\u02c8\u027eis\u033bo]\nCatalan: xori\u00e7o [\u0283u\u02c8\u027eisu]\nGalician: chourizo [t\u0283ow\u02c8\u027ei\u03b8\u028a]\nPortuguese: chouri\u00e7o [\u0283o(w)\u02c8\u027eisu]\nSpanish: chorizo [t\u0283o\u02c8\u027ei\u03b8o], [t\u0283o\u02c8\u027eiso]\n\n\nSpanish chorizo is made from coarsely chopped pork and pork fat, seasoned with garlic, piment\u00f3n \u2013 a smoked paprika \u2013 and salt. It is generally classed as either picante (spicy) or dulce (sweet), depending upon the type of piment\u00f3n used. Hundreds of regional varieties of Spanish chorizo, both smoked and unsmoked, may contain herbs, and other ingredients.\nFor example, chorizo de Pamplona is a thicker sausage with the meat more finely ground. Among the varieties is chorizo Riojano from the La Rioja region, which has PGI protection within the EU.\nChorizo is made in short or long and hard or soft varieties; leaner varieties are suited to being eaten at room temperature as an appetizer or tapas, whereas the fattier versions are generally used for cooking. A rule of thumb is that long, thin chorizos are sweet, and short chorizos are spicy, although this is not always the case.\nSpain produces many other pork specialties, as well, such as lomo embuchado or salchich\u00f3n, cured and air-dried in a similar way. Lomo is a lean, cured meat to slice, made from the loin of the pig, which is marinated and then air-dried. Salchich\u00f3n is another cured sausage without the piment\u00f3n seasoning of chorizo, but flavoured with black peppercorns, instead.\nDepending on the variety, chorizo can be eaten sliced without further cooking, sometimes sliced in a sandwich, or grilled, fried, or baked alongside other foodstuffs, and is also an ingredient in several dishes where it accompanies beans, such as fabada or cocido monta\u00f1\u00e9s or served as a tapas, such as Chorizo in Red Wine sauce.\nThe version of these dishes con todos los sacramentos (with all the trimmings, literally sacraments) adds to chorizo other preserved meats such as tocino (cured bacon) and morcilla (blood sausage).\nPortuguese chouri\u00e7o or chouri\u00e7a is a distinct sausage and not to be confused with chorizo. It is made (at least) with pork, fat, wine, paprika, garlic, hot pepper and salt. It is then stuffed into natural casings from pig or lamb and slowly dried over smoke. The many different varieties differ in color, shape, spices and taste. White pepper, piri-piri, cumin and cinnamon are a common addition. The Portuguese varieties tend to be hotter than the Spanish ones. Many dishes of Portuguese and Brazilian cuisine make use of chouri\u00e7o, including cozido \u00e0 portuguesa and feijoada.\nA popular way to prepare chouri\u00e7o is slicing it part-way through and cooking it over an alcohol flame at the table (chouri\u00e7o \u00e0 bombeiro) in purpose-made glazed earthenware dishes with a lattice top.\nIn Johannesburg, South Africa, the many Portuguese immigrants in the 1960s from Portugal and Mozambique tended to settle in a suburb called La Rochelle (Little Portugal). Most of them either returned to Portugal or moved on to more affluent suburbs in the city, but restaurants in the area and the very well-supported annual \"Lusitoland\" fundraiser festival have chouri\u00e7o on the menu.\nIn the heavily Portuguese counties in the US states of Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, chouri\u00e7o is often served with little neck clams and white beans. Chouri\u00e7o sandwiches on grinder rolls, with saut\u00e9ed green peppers and onions, are commonly available at local delis and convenience stores. Stuffed quahogs (also known as stuffies), a Rhode Island specialty, usually include chouri\u00e7o.\nIn Portugal chouri\u00e7o can be made with blood, similar to black pudding and is called chouri\u00e7a de sangue (blood chouri\u00e7o).  Other types of chouri\u00e7o include  chouri\u00e7a de vinho, chouri\u00e7o de cebola,  chouri\u00e7o fumado, chouri\u00e7o de ossos, chouri\u00e7\u00e3o and chouri\u00e7a de vinha d\u2019alho.\n\nBased on the uncooked Spanish chorizo fresco (fresh chorizo), the Mexican versions of chorizo are made not just from fatty pork, but also from beef, venison, chicken, turkey, and even tofu, kosher, and vegan versions are made. The meat is usually ground (minced) rather than chopped, and different seasonings are used. This type is better known in Mexico and other parts of the Americas, including the border areas of the United States, and is not frequently found in Europe. Due to culinary tradition and the",

The difference is the meat with which it is made, which is usually lean without much fat content, and that the meat is stuffed into a section of pork large intestine. The marinade used to flavor the chorizo is mainly composed of paprika, garlic and salt. Due to the thickness of the sausage, the maturity period is quite long. In the Philippines, the sausage has evolved into a stuffed meat roulade. The meat, which could be beef or pork, is cut into thin sheets and wrapped around hard-boiled eggs, ham, sausages, carrots, pickled cucumber slices and other ingredients to form a solid sausage. ...",

The bhathi is closed at the top with a metal cover and the smoke is emitted through a cylinder.\ntandoor\nTandoori chicken\nPunjabi cuisine\nPunjabi bhatti\nAccording to Burum (1992)\nBurum, Lindia (1992) A Guide to Ethnic Food in Los Angeles.HarperPerennial, \nMacveigh, Jeremy (2008) International Cuisine.

The origin of the dish and its name is disputed. One claim is that it was created from a mistake made by a fourteen-year-old assistant waiter Henri Charpentier in 1895 at the Maitre at Monte Carlo's Caf\u00e9 de Paris. He was preparing a dessert for the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, whose guests included a beautiful French girl named Suzette. This story was told by Charpentier himself in Life \u00e0 la Henri, his autobiography, although later contradicted by the Larousse Gastronomique.\nIt was quite by accident as I worked in front of a chafing dish that the cordials caught fire. I thought it was ruined. The Prince and his friends were waiting. How could I begin all over? I tasted it. It was, I thought, the most delicious medley of sweet flavors I had ever tasted. I still think so. That accident of the flame was precisely what was needed to bring all those various instruments into one harmony of taste\u00a0... He ate the pancakes with a fork; but he used a spoon to capture the remaining syrup. He asked me the name of that which he had eaten with so much relish. I told him it was to be called Cr\u00eapes Princesse. He recognized that the pancake controlled the gender and that this was a compliment designed for him; but he protested with mock ferocity that there was a lady present. She was alert and rose to her feet and holding her little skirt wide with her hands she made him a curtsey. \"Will you,\" said His Majesty, \"change Cr\u00eapes Princesse to Cr\u00eapes Suzette?\" Thus was born and baptized this confection, one taste of which, I really believe, would reform a cannibal into a civilized gentleman. The next day I received a present from the Prince, a jeweled ring, a panama hat and a cane.\nDifferent sources (like the Larousse Gastronomique) however doubt that Charpentier, rather than the head waiter, was serving the prince, because he would have been too young.  A less fantastical version emerges from Elsie Lee's interview with him in the 1950s. There, Charpentier explained at length that \"his complicated version began as the dish of pancakes with fruit sauce his foster mother made on very special occasions.\" The addition of liqueur was au courant among chefs in Paris at the time.\nThe other claim states that the dish was named in honour of French actress Suzanne Reichenberg (1853\u20131924), who worked professionally under the name Suzette. In 1897, Reichenberg appeared at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in the role of a maid, during which she served cr\u00eapes on stage. Monsieur Joseph, owner of Restaurant Marivaux, provided the cr\u00eapes. He decided to flamb\u00e9 the thin pancakes to attract the audience's attention and keep the food warm for the actors consuming them. Joseph was subsequently director of the Paillard Restaurant in Paris and was later with the Savoy Hotel in London.\nIn 1896, Oscar Tschirky published the recipe as \"Pancakes, Casino Style\" with everything in place except the final flamb\u00e9e. Escoffier described Cr\u00eapes Suzette in the English version of his Guide Culinaire in 1907 (French 1903) the same way, also without the final flamb\u00e9e.\nThe dish was already a specialty of the French restaurant Marie's by 1898.\nCourtine, Robert J.

The origin of the dish is claimed by both the Southern regions of Campania and Sicily. Other variations found outside Italy may include chicken, veal, or another type of meat cutlet or vegetable filling.\nThere are several theories about the origin of the dish. Most frequently its invention is attributed to either Parma, Sicily or Naples. The case for Parma is that Parmigiana refers to Parma and because Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese is produced there. Sicilian food writers have several different explanations for a Sicilian origin. According to author Pino Correnti the word parmigiana derives from the Sicilian word for damigiana, a wicker sleeve used both for wine bottles and the hot casserole in which the dish would be prepared and served. Authors Mary Taylor Simeti, Vincent Schiavelli, and several others write that the name derives from the Sicilian word for louver, palmigiana. The angled horizontal slats of a louver would resemble the layering of eggplant slices in the dish. Writer Franca Colonna Romano Apostolo suggests that the name is parmiciana, which means Persian in Sicilian.\nAuthor Clifford Wright argues that the case for Parma is not convincing because Parmigiano-Reggiano was already widely traded since the 14th century. Parmigiano-Reggiano also was not an important ingredient in the original dish. Because eggplant was first introduced to Sicily and the other southern regions, it is more likely that an eggplant dish was invented there. Finally, the dish is popular in Campania in general, Naples in particular, as well as Sicily and Calabria, but not in Parma. Wright considers the case for a Sicilian origin speculative because there is no evidence to support it.\nWright traces the origin of parmigiana to Naples. The ancestor of the modern dish appears in Vincenzo Corrado's cookbook Il cuoco galante from 1786. His recipe described eggplant seasoned with butter, herbs, cinnamon, other spices and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, which was then covered with a cream sauce of egg yolks before being baked in an oven. The modern version with Parmigiano-Reggiano and tomato rag\u00f9 as key ingredients appears several years later in Ippolito Cavalcanti's cookbook Cucina teorico-pratica which was published in Naples in 1837. According to Wright this suggests that the dish evolved in Naples during this time frame, which coincided with the increasing popularity of the tomato in Italian cuisine. Author Marlena Spieler agrees with a Neapolitan origin of the dish for the same reasons.\nIn Naples, Parmigiana is also prepared using zucchini or artichokes in place of eggplants.\nIn Apulia, Parmigiana is prepared not only frying eggplants but also breading them\nVariations made with breaded meat cutlets, such as veal and chicken, have been popularized in other countries, usually in areas of Italian immigration. In such areas the original dish may be called eggplant parmigiana to distinguish it from the meat versions.\nIn the United States and Canada, chicken parmigiana and veal parmigiana are often served as a main course often with a side of pasta. Chicken parmigiana is also served as the filling of a submarine sandwich. The alternative anglicization Parmesan is sometimes used instead, and the abbreviated form parm is common. The use of meats as an alternate to eggplant originated in the United States, where it was influenced by similar Italian dishes. A similar veal dish is known in Italian as Cotoletta alla bolognese, which excludes tomato sauce but includes melted Parmesan cheese and prosciutto. Costolette Parmigiana is another similar veal dish, but in Italy it is generally served without sauce or cheese. \nChicken parmigiana is also a common dish in Australia and is often served with a side of chips or salad. In Australia, where the name is often shortened to parma or parmi, it may also contain a variety of toppings, including sliced ham or bacon.\nIn Argentina and in other neighboring South American countries, veal or chicken parmigiana is topped with ham and served with french fries. It is known as milanesa a la napolitana. If the dish is topped with a fried egg, it is known as Milanesa a caballo, but omits the tomato sauce.\nIn England, the parmo uses either pork or chicken topped with b\u00e9chamel sauce instead of tomato sauce.\nList of eggplant dishes\nList of veal dishes\nCarne pizzaiola\nWright, Clifford A. \"A History of Eggplant Parmesan\".

Rough-surfaced pasta is recommended, to make the sauce adhere well.\nWhile not traditional to cacio e pepe, seafood or bacon may be added, and other shapes of pasta such as rigatoni, always made with a rough surface, may be used.\nCarbonara\nItalian cuisine\nList of pasta dishes\n\u00a0Food portal\nBoni (1930), p. 46\n\"Pasta cacio e pepe\".

It is a typical Hungarikum. It is usually made of fondant, covered by chocolate and wrapped in shiny coloured foil, then hung on the Christmas tree as decoration. Every year, almost a kilo and a half of it are consumed per household during Christmas season. The tradition of hanging these candies on the Christmas tree started in the 19th century. It was named szaloncukor because the tree usually stood in the parlour (szalon in Hungarian; Cukor means \"sugar\" or \"candy\"; in Slovak saln is \"parlour\" and -ka is diminutive suffix). ...",

The whole procedure was manual until the first fondant-machines have appeared. These were made by St\u00fchmer chocolate factory for the famous sweet-shop, Gerbaud. The last part of the procedure to be mechanized was the thrumming of the end of the paper cover. Considering that it has such a typical shape to keep, this part was not to be omitted.\nFondant candies originally came in a few flavours (vanilla and strawberry for example), but now there is a variety of candies, including jelly, coconut, hazelnut and many other flavors. It is usually hung on the tree with strings or small metal hooks. It is considered traditional on children's part, no matter how adults may frown, to empty all the wrappers on the tree before the season is out.\nThe earliest version of this fondant dessert emerged during the 14th century in France and was called fondantcukor. The recipe was altered through the years of European confectionery history. French pastry chef Pierre-Andre Manion in the 17th century introduced fondantcukor recipe in Germany.\nThe popularity of the fondant candies reached the shores of Hungary when German craftsmen migrated there in the 19th century. German wealthy families would erect Christmas trees in the entrance halls of their homes (called salons) and decorate them with sweets wrapped in shiny paper.\nSuch candies were made first in the 14th century in France. By the beginning of the 19th century it came through German intermediates to Hungary. In 1891, Hungarian-French chef and entrepreneur Hegyesi Joseph coined the name Szaloncukor which is derived from German fondant candy called \"Salonzuckerl\" which mean \"Sugar in Salons\".\nThe mass production of fondant candies wrapped in foil packaging was manufactured by steam-powered engines in 1883 in Hungary, mostly dedicated for creating traditional cakes of the Gerbeaud brand.\nFollowing Gerbeaud as inspiration, the family of Geza Kugler founded a chocolate factory in 1886. The Gerbeauds and Kuglers each adopted their own version of the recipe and published 19th-century recipe books of Hungarian confectionery. By the end of the 1800s, the candies were packed in tinfoil balls and colored tissue papers.\nIn 1941, the Kuglers opened the largest chocolate factory in Hungary.\nIn 1951 chocolate factory DEVA was founded in Trebi\u0161ov, Czechoslovakia (today Slovakia), which has been producing one of the best known chocolate Christmas candy in Slovakia, including \"parlour candy\" (sal\u00f3nky). Today, DEVA is brand owned by company ChocoSuc Partner s.r.o.\nChristmas trees\nPetr\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1, V\u011bra; Klaus, Ji\u0159\u00ed, edi.

Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.",

A popular variant in the United States is English toffee, which is a very buttery toffee often made with almonds. It is available in both chewy and hard versions. Heath bars are a brand of confection made with an English toffee core. Although named English toffee, it bears little resemblance to the wide range of confectionery known as toffee currently available in the United Kingdom. However, one can still find this product in the UK under the name \"butter crunch\". Conversely, in Italy they are known as \"mou candies\".\nThe origins of the word are unknown. Food writer Harold McGee claims it to be \"from the Creole for a mixture of sugar and molasses\", but which creole language is not specified.

Mozzarella sticks are elongated pieces of battered or breaded mozzarella, usually served as hors d'oeuvre.\nThe history of frying cheese in a batter dates back to at least 1393 in Medieval France, when a recipe for fried cheese sticks appeared in Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris. However, food historians believe that Medieval French fried cheeses had little in common with the preparation and development of modern mozzarella sticks.\nMozzarella sticks likely have their origins in the United States during the 1970s, through a combination of two factors, as per historian Joel Jensen: \"the increasing availability of mass-produced mozzarella cheese beginning in the 1960s,\" and the development of new efficient frying technologies to be used in fast-paced food-serving businesses (such as bowling alleys and sports bars).\nPopular fried cheeses other than mozzarella include provolone, Edam, cheddar, and American. Mozzarella sticks with raspberry sauce are part of the regional cuisine of New York's Capital District.\nFriedman, David. \"Le Menagier de Paris (Translated by Janet Hinson)\".

Kompot (\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0442 in: Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Bosnian, Macedonian and Ukrainian; Komposto in Turkish) was a widely used way of preserving fruit for the winter season in Southern and Eastern European countries. In 1885, Lucyna \u0106wierczakiewiczowa wrote in a recipe book that kompot preserved fruit so well it seemed fresh. Kompot was still popular in the 1970s. It is also popular in many Central Asian countries, such as Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.\nThe consumption of kompot has been declining since the 1980s. With the end of food preservation in many countries of South and Eastern Europe, kompot has been supplanted by fruit juice, soft drinks and mineral water.\nUzvar or vzvar is a similar  drink, prepared from various dried fruit and sometimes berries, sweetened with honey or sugar, popular in Ukraine and Russia.\nCompote\nFruit cocktail\nFruit punch\nKissel\nMors\nTong sui\nhttps://arpacbahsismtal.meb.k12.tr/meb_iys_dosyalar/33/05/974043/dosyalar/2017_10/19221440_tYrk_mutfaYnda_komposto_ve_hoYaflar_07.pdf\n\"D\u00fcnya mutfa\u011f\u0131nda komposto\".\n\"Turkish Food & Recipes\".\nLucyna \u0106wierczakiewiczowa, Jedyne praktyczne przepisy konfitur, r\u00f3\u017cnych marynat, w\u0119dlin, w\u00f3dek, likier\u00f3w, win owocowych, miod\u00f3w oraz ciast\nBerger, Stanis\u0142aw (2005).

Bakmi (Javanese: \ua9a7\ua98f\ua9c0\ua9a9\ua9b6, romanized:\u00a0bakmi) or bami (Thai: \u0e1a\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e35\u0e48, [b\u0101.m\u00ec\u02d0]) is a type of wheat based noodles derived from Chinese cooking tradition. It was brought to Southeast Asia by Chinese immigrants from Southern Chinese provinces like Fujian. It is typically prepared seasoned in soy sauce and topped with pork products, which is often substituted for other protein sources in predominantly Muslim Indonesia. Chinese-style wheat noodles has become one of the most common noodle dishes, especially in Southeast Asian countries which have significant Chinese populations and known by various names.\nChinese-style wheat noodles is known as bakmi in Indonesia, where it has been adapted to more closely align with the local tastes and adapted in Javanese and Indo cuisine. Bakmi is between Chinese style wheat noodles and Japanese udons in thickness, and there are several variants of bakmi in Indonesia. Although the name bakmi literally translate to \"pork noodle\", different types of meat might be used, including chicken and beef.\nBakmi consists of two Hokkien Chinese words, which literally translates to English as \"meat noodles\" (\u8089\u9eb5, Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: bah-m\u012b). \nChinese influences is evident in Indonesian food, such as bakmi, mie ayam, pangsit, mie goreng, and kwetiau goreng. The words mie and bami, used in Dutch, come from bakmi and were introduced into the Dutch language during the Dutch colonial period in Indonesia. Indonesian food is very popular in the Netherlands, and bami goreng (fried bakmi) is a popular dish.\nIn Thailand, wheat-based egg noodles are known as bami, which  may be ordered as bami nam or bami haeng (egg noodles with soup and without soup respectively), and the noodles may be used in Chinese style stir-fried dishes.\nBakmi is normally boiled for serving. When bakmi is intended for use in soup, it is usually boiled separately from the broth. The noodles are usually mixed with animal fats, either from pork, chicken or beef. The noodles are then served with various toppings: an example would include a few slices of char siu (\u53c9\u71d2) or barbecued pork, with addition of Chinese green vegetables and a bowl of broth. \nIn Indonesia, the most common toppings are diced seasoned chicken with choy sum and fried wonton skin, to more expensive type using fried or boiled wonton and bakso (meatballs). The soup is served in a different bowl, and is added to the noodles by the individual diner according to taste. Several notable Indonesian dishes developed from the original Chinese wheat noodle tradition includes mie ayam (chicken noodle) and mie goreng (stir fried noodle in sweet soy sauce). I fu mie is bakmi that is first deep fried and then topped with a thickened gravy of vegetables and meat.\n\nBakmi bangka, a Chinese Indonesian noodle dish from Bangka Island. It is a plate of noodle topped with minced pork, slices of braised pork, mushroom and chopped scallion. The original Chinese Indonesian version uses minced pork, the halal version however, usually uses minced chicken.\nBakmi siantar, pork noodle from Pematang Siantar town in North Sumatra, usually served with red char siu coloured with angkak. Popular within Batak cuisine, it was derived from, and possibly the most closer version to the traditional Chinese Indonesian bakmi (meat/pork noodle).\nBakmi ayam, Indonesian Chinese chicken noodles.\nBakmi goreng, Indonesian Chinese fried noodles, omnipresent in Indonesia.\nBakmi jawa, from Central and East Java with somewhat wet consistency.\nBakmi aceh, from Aceh, it has a curry-like flavor.\nBakmi celor, from Palembang, it has a sweet starchy gravy.\nBakmi pangsit, generally known from Sumatera area, North Sumatera, Medan, etc.\nBakmi belitung, from Belitung island, with sweet white sauce.\nBakmi kangkung, it is composed of noodles, kangkung, bean sprouts, lime juice, mince meat, and broth.\nBami haeng (Thai: \u0e1a\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e35\u0e48\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e14, a dish made with wheat noodles (bami) served \"dry\" (haeng).\nBami mu daeng\t(Thai: \u0e1a\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07), noodle dish with red roast pork.\nKhao soi (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e0b\u0e2d\u0e22), Northern Thai curry-soup dish which uses bami noodles.\nKolo mee\nMie ayam\nMie goreng\nMie rebus\n\"Sejarah Bakmie Indonesia\".

Though creamy vegetable pie recipes date back to Medieval Europe, sweet potato pie appears in the southern United States from the early colonial days. The use of sweet potatoes in Southern and African-American cuisine traces back to West African influences. The sweet potato, which is native to the Americas, was likely used by African slaves as an alternative to the yam found in their homeland. Sweet potato pie applies European pie making customs to the preparation of sweet potatoes. Recipes for sweet potato pie first appeared in printed cookbooks in the 18th century, where it was included with savory vegetable dishes. By the 19th century, sweet potato pie was more commonly classified as a dessert.\nOne variation is the Hawaiian sweet potato haupia pie.\nPurple sweet potato haupia pie\nFried sweet potato\nList of custard desserts\nPie in American cuisine\nList of pies, tarts and flans\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nSweet potato soup\n\u00a0Food portal\nOlver, Lynne (1999). \"Sweet Potato Pie\".

The base ingredients of the aforementioned spicy stir-fry are: garlic, shallots, fresh chilies, and shrimp paste, and it is topped with holy basil. Eventually, the stir-fry was converted into a noodle dish made with broad rice noodles (kuaitiao sen yai in Thai), soy sauce, fish sauce, oyster sauce, garlic, meat, seafood, chili, fresh black pepper pods and holy basil, which give rise to its distinctive spiciness. Certain versions of this dish may include eggs. The recipe for the noodles is not rigid and may often differ.

In Thai, pad means 'to stir-fry' and khi mao means 'drunkard'. The dish is widely available in restaurants or at street vendors in Thailand but it is also highly popular in the United States. and has become ubiquitous on Thai restaurant menus throughout. Despite its name, alcohol is not one of the ingredients.\nThe origin of the name behind the dish is unclear, but there are several explanations. One anecdotal explanation for the name \"drunkard (or drunken) noodles\" is that the meal is often consumed after a night of drinking, prepared from assorted leftovers commonly on hand and staple ingredients. Others say that the name comes through the idea that the spicy seasoning of the dish is \"meant to tear through the dulled palates of the inebriated.\" Another anecdotal explanation is that during the Vietnam War, the US troops couldn\u2019t pronounce the colloquially pronounced name for mixed noodles dish that sounded to them like \u201cdrunken\u201d, and that\u2019s how the name became popular. \nThere are also local stories regarding the origins of the dish. One story is that a wife was upset by her husband's post-drinking behavior and decided to teach him a lesson. She added as many spices as she could find to his favorite noodles. She believed that the heavy mixture of spices along with a handful of chilies would fix her husband's behavior.\n\nDrunken chicken\nFried noodles\n\"Drunken noodles or Pad Kee Mao?

Fannie Farmer gives a recipe for them in her 1896 Boston Cooking-School Cook Book. The story of their creation has several variations, but they all involve an angry pastry cook throwing unfinished rolls into the oven, which results in their dented appearance. The recipe for Parker House Rolls first started appearing in cookbooks in the 1880s.",

Towards the end of the seventeenth century the Reverend Samuel Wigley founded the Currant Bun Company in Southampton, Hampshire, UK. He imported currants from the island of Zakynthos where he had served as a missionary in his youth. Despite having failed to convert the population to Puritanism he did bring back the prize of the currant which he combined with traditional Hampshire bakery expertise to create the currant bun.\nIn 1824 Duncan Higgins adapted the recipe and used the now freely available Zakynthos currants to create the classic Chelsea bun in his bakery on Fulham Road, adjacent to the fashionable Chelsea district of London.\nEvery year in February the descendants of Mr Higgins hold a Chelsea Bun festival in which they celebrate their forefather's culinary achievements.\nList of buns\n\u00a0Food portal\nChris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press, 2006, ISBN\u00a00-7862-8517-6\nDavidson, Alan.

After the buns are baked, they are inverted so that the pan lining then becomes a topping.

Kozhukattai, although usually sweet, can sometimes be stuffed with a savory filling. Modak is a similar dish made in other parts of India.\nIn Tamil Nadu, the dish is traditionally associated with the Hindu God Ganesha and is prepared as an offering (naivedhya) on the occasion of Vinayaka Chathurthi. It is prepared by Kerala Christians on the Saturday prior to Palm Sunday and the day is hence called Kozhukatta Saturday. In Kerala, it is also eaten as an evening snack with tea or coffee.\nKozhukkattai is an important part of several natal customs of the Sri Lankan Tamil community. In northern Sri Lanka, there is a custom involving dumplings whose edges are pressed to resemble teeth being dropped gently on a baby's head while the family wishes for the infant to develop healthy teeth. In eastern areas of Sri Lanka such as Amparai district, a smaller version called pi\u1e37\u1e37ai kozhukka\u1e6d\u1e6dai is prepared by female family members for an expectant mother about four months after conception. These sweets are commonly exchanged at weddings as auspicious symbols of \"plump\" health and fertility.\n\nList of Indian sweets and desserts\nThennai Kozhakkattai\nManda pitha\nMomo (dumpling)\nList of dumplings\nSri Lanka.

Recipes for Bosanski lonac vary greatly according to personal and regional preference, but the main ingredients generally include chunked meat and vegetables. Mixed meats may be used in the dish. It has been described as a national dish of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nBosanski lonac has been on tables of both the rich and the poor for hundreds of years. The wealthy prepared the dish with more meat and other expensive ingredients, while the poor used what was available. Typical ingredients are: beef, lamb, bell peppers, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, parsley, garlic, peppercorns (whole, not ground). Many different vegetables or meats may be used. Bosanski lonac is prepared by layering meat and vegetables (alternating layers of meat and vegetables until the pot is full) into a deep pot, then adding 1 - 2 dl of water.

Kozhukattai, although usually sweet, can sometimes be stuffed with a savory filling. Modak is a similar dish made in other parts of India.\nIn Tamil Nadu, the dish is traditionally associated with the Hindu God Ganesha and is prepared as an offering (naivedhya) on the occasion of Vinayaka Chathurthi. It is prepared by Kerala Christians on the Saturday prior to Palm Sunday and the day is hence called Kozhukatta Saturday. In Kerala, it is also eaten as an evening snack with tea or coffee.\nKozhukkattai is an important part of several natal customs of the Sri Lankan Tamil community. In northern Sri Lanka, there is a custom involving dumplings whose edges are pressed to resemble teeth being dropped gently on a baby's head while the family wishes for the infant to develop healthy teeth. In eastern areas of Sri Lanka such as Amparai district, a smaller version called pi\u1e37\u1e37ai kozhukka\u1e6d\u1e6dai is prepared by female family members for an expectant mother about four months after conception.

It can be made using an electric espresso machine, but is commonly made with a moka pot. Either some or all of the espresso is vigorously mixed with a spoon into a creamy foam called espuma or espumita. The heat from the coffee-making process will hydrolyze some of the sucrose, thereby creating a sweeter and slightly more viscous result than a normal pull or adding sugar at the table.",

Caf\u00e9 Cubano (also known as  Cuban espresso, Colada, Cuban coffee, cafecito, Cuban pull, and Cuban shot) is a type of espresso that originated in Cuba. Specifically, it refers to an espresso shot which is sweetened (traditionally with natural brown sugar which has been whipped with the first and strongest drops of espresso). However, the name is sometimes used to refer to coffee-based drinks that include Cuban espresso as the main ingredient, such as caf\u00e9 con leche.\nDrinking caf\u00e9 cubano remains a prominent social and cultural activity in Cuba and in Cuban-American communities, particularly in Miami, Tampa and the Florida Keys.\nCortadito is a standard espresso shot topped off with steamed milk. The ratio can be between 50/50 and 75/25 espresso and milk. It is similar to a cortado served in other Latin countries, but pre-sweetened.\nCaf\u00e9 con leche, or \"coffee with milk\", is an espresso served alongside a cup of hot or steamed milk. Traditionally served separate from the coffee, the espresso is poured to the desired darkness into the cup of hot milk and then stirred. It is the traditional Cuban breakfast beverage, served with slices of buttered, toasted cuban bread.\nColada is 3\u20136 shots of Cuban-style espresso served in a Styrofoam cup along with small, plastic demitasses. It is a takeaway form, meant to be drunk as one shot. This is customary of workplace breaks in Cuban communities.\nCoffee production in Cuba\nDalgona coffee\nList of coffee drinks\nList of hot beverages\nVietnamese iced coffee\n\"How to Make Cuban Coffee - Cafe Cubano Recipe | MokaBees\".

Heavy cream may be added during the boiling process to hasten the thickening process. Once reduced, a little sugar, cardamom, charoli and/or saffron are added. Basundi is preserved well after sugar is added. Sugar develops some acidity over a period of time. If it is excessive, then it can curdle the basundi. Sometimes after adding sugar, one cooks it for some more time; this gives a nice pink color to basundi, as sugar is also cooked in milk turning into a light caramel. Before adding sugar, basundi is thick, but after adding, it becomes fluid again. Stirring well prevents malai from being formed on top and all guests (even late comers) can enjoy equally thick and plain basundi. Basundi is served chilled, often garnished with slices of almonds and pistachios. \nAdding less saffron reduces colour intensity. The addition of condensed milk gives a nice flavour and richness to basundi.\nBasundi can be served hot, warm or chilled.

P. Bloch has written that \n\"The tradition of giving money (Chanukah gelt) to children is of long standing. The custom had its origin in the 17th-century practice of Polish Jewry to give money to their small children for distribution to their teachers. In time, as children demanded their due, money was also given to children to keep for themselves. Teenage boys soon came in for their share. According to Magen Avraham (18th century), it was the custom for poor yeshiva students to visit homes of Jewish benefactors who dispensed Chanukah money (Orach Chaim 670). The rabbis approved of the custom of giving money on Chanukah because it publicized the story of the miracle of the oil.\"\nAccording to popular legend, it is linked to the miraculous victory of the Maccabees over the ancient Greeks. To celebrate their freedom, the Hasmoneans minted national coins. It may also have begun in 18th-century Eastern Europe as a token of gratitude toward religious teachers, similar to the custom of tipping service people on Christmas. In 1958, the Bank of Israel issued commemorative coins for use as Hanukkah gelt. That year, the coin bore the image of the same menorah that appeared on Maccabean coins 2,000 years ago.\nAmerican chocolatiers of the 20th century picked up on the gift/coin concept by creating chocolate gelt. In the 1920s, Loft's, an American candy company, produced the first chocolate gelt, wrapped in gold or silver foil in mesh pouches resembling money bags.\nChocolate coins are also given to children as part of Saint Nicholas Day in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Today most of the chocolate Hanukkah gelt sold in the United States is imported, including from Dutch firms Steenland Chocolate and the Israeli firms Elite and Carmit. Gourmet versions of chocolate gelt have been produced in the United States and Europe as well.\nParents often give children chocolate gelt to play dreidel with. In terms of actual gelt (money), parents and grandparents or other relatives may give sums of money as an official Hanukkah gift. According to a survey done in 2006, 74 percent of parents in Israel give their children Chanukah gelt.\nIn Hasidic communities, the Rebbes distribute coins to those who visit them during Hanukkah. Hasidic Jews consider this to be an auspicious blessing from the Rebbe, and a segulah for success. The amount is usually in small coins.\nList of candies\nChocolate coins\nAbraham P. Bloch (1980).

Stuffed fish, also called \"Bal\u0131q L\u0259v\u0259ngisi\", is usually prepared for Nowruz; The preferred fish is the Caspian kutum, asp or carp of the Caspian Sea, but white fish-beluga can also be suitable.\nThe ingredients for stuffing include peeled walnuts, chopped and well-fried onions, sour prune or sour cherry or a pomegranate juice syrup called narsharab (\"nar\" is the local name of pomegranate in Azerbaijan), dried cherry-plums, raisins and vegetable oil. They are mixed with a cup of water, and salt and pepper are also added to taste, if the fish has caviar, it is also used in the filling.\nThe fish is skinned and washed, and then filled with stuffing after it dries. The belly of the fish is sewed (in order to make the stuffing stay in) and then outside of the fish is rubbed with narsharab or cherry-plum sauce. The fish is baked in the oven until the top of it fries. It is served with pieces of lemon, bread and narsharab.\nThe stuffing is prepared by mincing the onions, squeezing them into a cloth to remove the left over juice and mixing all ingredients (crushed walnuts, onions, raisins, narsharab).The chicken is first wiped with salt and pepper and then stuffed with the mentioned mixture and then sewed. Outside of the chicken is rubbed with vegetable oil and cherry-plum paste and baked in medium oven until turn red.\nThen it is served with lemon pieces and simple rice-pilaf, in which the rice is fried in butter and then cooked in chicken broth with sesame, ginger, salt and pepper and served with roasted almonds.\nDolma\n\"Levengi | Traditional Side Dish from Lankaran Region | TasteAtlas\".\n\"How to make fish lavangi\".

George Washington Carver (1864-1943), an American agricultural extension educator, from Alabama's Tuskegee Institute, was the most well known promoter of the peanut as a replacement for the cotton crop, which had been heavily damaged by the boll weevil. He compiled 105 peanut recipes from various cookbooks, agricultural bulletins and other sources. In his 1925 research bulletin called How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it for Human Consumption, he included three recipes for peanut cookies calling for crushed or chopped peanuts.\nIt was not until the early 1930s that peanut butter was listed as an ingredient in the cookies.\nEarly peanut butter cookies were either rolled thin and cut into shapes, or else they were dropped and made into balls; they did not have fork marks. The first reference to the famous criss-cross marks created with fork tines was published in the Schenectady Gazette on July 1, 1932. The Peanut Butter Cookies recipe said: \"[s]hape into balls and after placing them on the cookie sheet, press each one down with a fork, first one way and then the other, so they look like squares on waffles.\"\nPillsbury, one of the large flour producers, popularized the use of a fork in the 1930s. The Peanut Butter Balls recipe in the 1933 edition of Pillsbury's Balanced Recipes instructed the cook to press the cookies using fork tines. These early recipes do not explain why the advice is given to use a fork, though. The reason is that peanut butter cookie dough is dense, and unpressed, each cookie will not cook evenly. Using a fork to press the dough is a convenience of tool; bakers can also use a cookie shovel (spatula).\nPeanut butter blossom cookie (peanut butter cookie with Hershey's kiss in center)\nList of cookies\nList of peanut dishes\n\u00a0Food portal\nPeanut Butter Cookies(www.NewEnglandRecipes.org)\nhttp://plantanswers.tamu.edu/recipes/peanutrecipes.html Archived March 5, 2007, at the Wayback Machine plantanswers.tamu.edu\nCooks.com's Peanut Butter Cookie Recipes - A wide assortment of recipes\nGeorge Washington Carver. \"How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it for Human Consumption,\" Tuskegee Institute Experimental Station Bulletin 31, 1916.\nAndrew F.

A \u010desnica (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0447\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430, [t\u0283\u011b\u02d0snit\u035csa]; derived from the noun \u010dest, meaning \"share\"), also called Bo\u017ei\u0107na poga\u010da (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0411\u043e\u0436\u0438\u045b\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0447\u0430, \"Christmas poga\u010da\") is the ceremonial, round loaf of bread that is an indispensable part of Christmas dinner in Serbian tradition. The preparation of this bread may be accompanied by various rules and rituals. A coin is often put into the dough during the kneading; other small objects may also be inserted. At the beginning of Christmas dinner, the \u010desnica is rotated three times counterclockwise, before being broken among the family members. The person who finds the coin in his piece of the bread will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The \u010desnica was used in folk magic for divining or influencing the amount of crops.\nChristmas dinner is the most festive meal of the year. It begins about noon, or even earlier. The family members seated at the table stand up when the head of household gives a sign. The head makes the Sign of the Cross and lights a candle, before censing the gathered relatives and saying a prayer, after which they all kiss each other while saying, \"Peace of God, Christ Is Born.\" The head and another man of the family hold the \u010desnica between themselves, rotating it three times counterclockwise. The \u010desnica is then carefully broken among the relatives, so that each of them gets his own piece of the bread, without a crumb falling off.\nUp to three pieces of the loaf may be set aside: one for the absent relatives (if there are such), one for a stranger who might join the family at the dinner, and one for the polaznik, their first visitor on Christmas Day (if he is not present). The rest of the \u010desnica is consumed during the dinner. The family member who finds the coin in his piece of the bread will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The head may try to buy the coin from this lucky relative. Each of the other objects hidden in the bread indicates the segment of the household economy in which the person who finds it in his share of the \u010desnica will be especially successful.\nIn some regions, such as the Bay of Kotor and Bukovica, the \u010desnica is not broken and eaten at Christmas dinner. It is instead placed on the table or nearby, with a candle stuck into it. The head of household lights this candle at the beginning of Christmas dinner. In Bukovica, several olive or bay laurel twigs are stuck around the candle. In the Bay of Kotor, the date when the \u010desnica is eaten varies from place to place; it may be even twenty days after Christmas, on the Feast of Saint Sava. In some areas only half of the \u010desnica is consumed at Christmas dinner, the other half being eaten a week later, on the Feast of St. Basil the Great.\nThe \u010desnica may be used for divination in some regions. In Bosnia, when the dough is shaped and ready for baking, a number of notches are cut in the upper surface of it, and seeds of various crops are placed into the notches. The more a notch has risen when the \u010desnica is baked, the more productive the crop whose seed is in it will be in the following year. In Jadar, western Serbia, the number of embers of the badnjak equal to the sum of grain and livestock sorts grown by the family are taken out of the fire and placed on the \u010desnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. To ensure an abundance of grain, some people place a bowl filled with grain on the \u010desnica.\nIn 19th-century Herzegovina, two men would rotate the \u010desnica between themselves, one of them asking, \"Am I protruding [from behind the \u010desnica]?\" and the other responding, \"You are, a little.\" The first man would then say, \"Now a little, and next year not even a little.\" The purpose of this conversation was to invoke an abundance of grain in the coming year. A similar practice was recorded in the 12th century among West Slavs on the island of Rugia in the Baltic Sea. Those Slavs were adherents of the cult of Svantovit, and had a big temple dedicated to that god at Cape Arkona. Saxo Grammaticus described, in the Book XIV of his Gesta Danorum, the festival of Svantovit which was held annually after harvest in front of that temple. In one of the rituals, a round loaf of bread covered with honey, with the diameter equal to a man's height, was held vertically in front of the statue of Svantovit. The priest of the temple went behind the loaf, before asking the gathered people whether they saw him. After they responded that they did, the priest expressed the wish that next year they would not see him. The aim of the ritual was to ensure a rich harvest of grain in the following year.\nChristmas does not",

Various sorts of cakes sweetened with honey have been known since ancient times, in Egypt, Rome, and the Middle East. Arabs brought these traditions to Sicily and Moorish Spain. In the 11th century, a type of strongly spiced thick cake made from breadcrumbs and honey, resembling panforte, became popular in Italy. Italian Jews brought some of these styles to Western and Central Europe. The earliest known record in a Jewish source of a cake called lekach, from the Middle High German lecke, 'to lick', was in about 1200 in Sefer ha-Rokeach by Eleazar ben Judah of Worms, Germany.\nMany Ashkenazi versions by the 13th century were influenced by or based on Lebkuchen or Honigkuchen (honey cake) recipes found in Germany. Such heavily spiced cakes, analogous to the English gingerbread, became popular all over medieval Europe in both Jewish and Christian communities, especially at festive occasions. Lekach has changed drastically over the centuries, such that its current forms bear little resemblance to its ancestors. There are now many variations, ranging from dark and heavy to lighter more delicate versions, though in general it is never frosted. Lekach was brought to the Land of Israel by Ashkenazi immigrants.\nA very traditional honey cake from the Jewish community of Austria contains an equal weight of white rye flour and dark honey, strong coffee instead of water, cloves, cinnamon, allspice, and golden raisins in the loaf, with slivered almonds on top of the loaf. It also has a fair number of eggs, vegetable oil (usually corn oil), salt, and baking powder.\nRecipes vary widely.  Lekach is usually a dense, loaf-shaped cake, but some versions are similar to sponge cake or pound cake, with the addition of honey and spices, sometimes with coffee or tea for coloring. Other versions are more like gingerbread, pain d'\u00e9pices, or lebkuchen.\nJewish cuisine\nJewish apple cake\nMarks, Gil (17 November 2010). Encyclopedia of Jewish Food. HMH.

Teiglach date back to the times of the Romans who made strips of fried dough in honey called vermiculi. Italian Jews adopted the dish but it disappeared from their repertoire in the Middle Ages. In the 12th century Franco-German rabbis mentioned eating a dish of fried or baked strips of dough covered in honey called vermesel or verimlish at the beginning of the Sabbath meal. The name went through changes, being called gremsel and then chremsel in Eastern Europe. It is popular on Rosh Hashanah, when it is traditional to eat sweet foods made with honey to usher in a sweet new year.\nRomanow, Katherine (September 7, 2010). \"Eating Jewish: Teiglach (Ashkenazic Honey Dough Balls)\".

The outside of the cake is then thickly coated with more buttercream and topped with caramel-covered brittle nuts, called Krokant, toasted almond flakes and/or ground hazelnuts. Krokant is signature to this dish. Frankfurter Kranz is considered a reminiscence of Frankfurt as the coronation city of the Holy Roman emperors. ...",
