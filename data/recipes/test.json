The earliest known mention of ravioli appears in the personal letters of Francesco di Marco Datini, a merchant of Prato in the 14th century. In Venice, the mid-14th-century manuscript Libro per cuoco offers ravioli of green herbs blanched and minced, mixed with beaten egg and fresh cheese, simmered in broth and seasoned with \"sweet and strong spices\".  In Rome, ravioli were already well-known when Bartolomeo Scappi served them with boiled chicken to the papal conclave of 1549.\nRavioli were already known in 14th century England, appearing in the Anglo-Norman vellum manuscript Forme of Cury under the name of rauioles. \nSicilian ravioli and Malta's ravjul may thus be older than North Italian ones. Maltese ravjul are stuffed with irkotta, the locally produced sheep's-milk ricotta, or  with gbejna, the traditional fresh sheep's-milk cheese.\nTraditionally, ravioli are made at home. The filling varies according to the area where they are prepared. In Rome and Latium the filling is made with ricotta cheese, spinach, nutmeg and black pepper. In Sardinia, ravioli are filled with ricotta and grated lemon rind.\nModern ravioli are also mass-produced by machine.\nIn Europe and the United States, fresh-packed ravioli have several weeks of shelf life. Canned ravioli were pioneered by the Italian Army in the First World War and were popularized by Heinz and Buitoni in the UK and Europe, and Chef Boyardee in the United States. Canned ravioli may be filled with beef, processed cheese, chicken, or Italian sausage and served in a tomato, tomato-meat, or tomato-cheese sauce. Toasted ravioli (ravioli that have been breaded and deep fried) was developed in St. Louis, Missouri, and is a popular appetizer and snack food.\nRavioli are commonly encountered in the cooking of Nice, the broader C\u00f4te d'Azur, and the surrounding regions in the south of France. The contents of these vary greatly, but most idiosyncratic to the region is the use of leftover daube meat.  Miniaturized cheese-filled ravioli, locally called ravioles, are a specialty of the Dr\u00f4me department in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, particularly the commune of Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re, and are frequently served au gratin.\nRavioli filled with halloumi are a traditional pasta dish of Cypriot cuisine. They are boiled in chicken stock and served with grated halloumi and dried mint on top.\nIn Turkey, Mant\u0131 which is similar to ravioli is a popular dish. It is stuffed with spiced meat and served with paprika sauce and yoghurt. Similar dishes in China are the jiaozi or wonton.\nIn India, a popular dish called gujiya is similar to ravioli. However, it is prepared sweet, with a filling of dry fruits, sugar, and a mixture of sweet spices, then deep fried in vegetable oil. Different stuffings are used in different parts of India. The dish is a popular food prepared during festivals all over the country.\nJewish cuisine has a similar dish called kreplach, a pocket of meat or other filling, with an egg pasta based covering. It is simmered in chicken soup. In that method of preparation it appears to be the direct descendant or inspiration of the original dish, which was simmered in \"broth\".  Claudia Roden argues it originated in the Venetian Ghetto at about the same time ravioli was developed, and in time became a mainstay of Jewish cuisine.\nA similar Middle Eastern dish called shishbarak contains pasta filled with minced beef meat and cooked in hot yogurt.\nAgnolotti\nBaozi\nGnocchi\nItalian cuisine\nKhinkali\nList of dumplings\nList of Italian dishes\nMandu\nMant\u0131\nMataz\nMaultasche\nModak / Kozhakkattai\nMomo (food)\nPelmeni\nPierogi\nSamosa\nTortellini\n\nDavidson Oxford Companion to Food, p. 655.\nDickie Delizia, p. 55.\nDickie Delizia, p. 11\nAdamson Regional Cuisines, p. 25.\nMadehow.com, How Products are Made, \"Pasta\".\nSmith.

In English, cannoli is usually  used as a singular, but in Italian, it is grammatically plural; the corresponding singular is cannolo (Italian:\u00a0[kan\u02c8n\u0254\u02d0lo]; Sicilian: cannolu [kan\u02c8n\u0254\u02d0l\u028a]), a diminutive meaning 'little tube', from canna, 'cane' or 'tube'. This form is uncommon in English.\nSome food historians place the origins of cannoli in 827\u20131091\u00a0AD  in Caltanissetta, by the concubines of princes looking to capture their attention. \nAuthor Gaetano Basile merged this legend with other historical traditions to determine that cannoli come from the Palermo and Messina areas and were historically prepared as a treat during Carnival season, possibly as a fertility symbol. The dessert eventually became a year-round staple in Sicily.\nSome similar desserts in Middle Eastern tradition include \"Zaynab's fingers\" (\u0623\u0635\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u0632\u064a\u0646\u0628), which are filled with nuts, and qanaw\u0101t (\u0642\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062a), deep-fried dough tubes filled with various sweets, which were a popular pastry across the ancient Islamic world. The dish and the name may originate from the Muslim Emirate of Sicily. The minne di Sant'Agata or minni di virgini, cheese filled half spheres with icing and fruit are shaped like a breast in honour of St Agatha. Feddi d\u00fb cancillieri (\"chancellor's slices\") are similar cream and apricot jam filled almond cookies designed to look like the rear of a person.\nRicotta\nHyblean ricotta\nGangi, Robert (2006). \"Cannoli\". bestofsicily.com.

In Puerto Rico, sancocho is considered a fairly rustic dish. It is made with chicken and smoked ham (Sancocho de gallina), top round beef (sancocho), pork feet with chickpeas (sancocho de patitas), beef short ribs with chorizo, or fish with shellfish cooked in coconut milk and ginger (Caldo Santo). There are several versions and every household has their own take on sancocho, but a true Puerto Rican sancocho always calls for corn on the cob, a variety of tubers, squash, green bananas, and meat. The hearty stew is served with a small bowl of rice, pique criollo, tostones, and bread.\nIn Venezuela, sancochos are prepared throughout the country, recognized as a typical meal of the weekend. The stew can be beef (usually in the Llanos region), chicken (usually central and western region), beef stomach and shank (simply called \"tripe\") or goat (here called \"goat tripe\", typical of western Falc\u00f3n and Lara states) and fish or seafood (usually East and Caribbean coast). When mixing two types of meat (chicken and beef, etc.) is called crossover or \"cruzado\". Among vegetables and traditional spices for all varieties are yam, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, potato, cassava, jojoto (maize/corn), celery (celeriac), taro (mafafa/malanga), pumpkin (squash), cabbage, Chinese taro or Chirel hot pepper, cilantro, and green or topocho banana.\nThese soups are major Venezuelan cuisine dishes that are not usually accompanied by other foods. Consumed at lunchtime or in the evening, the stew is a common dish at celebrations, usually served during or after meals\u2014the latter, according to popular belief, to relieve hangover. For this reason, it is typical to serve this dish for lunch on Christmas or New Year's Day.\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, it is known as sancoche or \"Saturday soup\", because, like the Venezuelan version, it is primarily eaten on the weekend. The fish version of the dish is known as \"fish broff\". Generally, these are heavily spiced with green seasoning, pimiento (seasoning pepper) and hot pepper (scotch bonnet).\nIt is usually served with cassava or with arepas. Some people add lemon juice (especially fish). There are variants of the same, such as the cruzado and the three-phase, when three types of meat are combined. The popularity of this dish is seen at celebrations: Instead of saying one is going to a party, it is common to \"go to a sancocho.\" Colloquially, it is often simply called \"soup\". In some regions (as in Zulia state) it is given the name sop\u00f3n.\nSancocho is a traditional food in Colombia made with many kinds of meat (most commonly chicken, hen, pork ribs, cow ribs, fish, and ox tail) with large pieces of plantain, potato, cassava and/or other vegetables such as tomato, scallion, cilantro, and mazorca (corn on the cob), depending on the region. Some top it off with fresh cilantro, onion and squeezed lime \u2014 a sort of \"pico de gallo\", minus the tomato. It is also served with a side of sliced avocado and a plate of white rice, which is usually dipped in with each spoonful of soup.\nIn the \"Sierra\" of Ecuador, sancocho, also known as fritada, is a comfort food made with pork. In the coastal region, it is similar to the Colombian sancocho. It has the typical ingredients: yuca, plantain, and corn \"choclo\". It can be made of fish, hen, chicken, oxtail, or beef. Due to cultural differences, it can cause confusion when people go from one region to the other.\nThe Peruvian sancocho is called \"sancochado\" a baseline: meat chunks, corn, rice, and potatoes.\nIn the Dominican Republic, \"sancocho\"  is considered one of the national dishes, along with \"la bandera\" (the flag), consisting of white rice, generally red beans and meat, usually chicken. There is a variant called sancocho cruzado or sancocho de siete carnes, which includes chicken, beef and pork, with other meats. Sancocho de siete carnes means \"seven meat sancocho\" and is considered the ultimate sancocho dish. Longaniza, a type of pork sausage, is also used. Sancocho de gallina (hen sancocho) is common as well, often made for special occasions or on weekends. While sancocho de habichuela (bean sancocho) and sancocho de guandules are common, other types of sancocho are very rare.\nThere is a similar dish in Costa Rica: It is called olla de carne (meat pot).\nAlso known as sancocho de gallina, it is the national dish of Panama. The basic ingredients are chicken, \u00f1ame (adding flavor and acting as a thickener, giving it its characteristic texture and brightness), and culantro (giving it most of its characteristic flavor and greenish tone); often yuca, mazorca (corn on the cob) and otoe are added.

Galletas dulces have a layer of caramel and sugar on top and are known as bizcochos in Uruguay\nMargaritas: They are a variation of croissants found both in Uruguay and Argentina.  The ends are joined together, leaving some space in the middle for a sweet filling (pastry cream, dulce de membrillo or dulce de leche). They have sugar on top of the pastry and the filling. Margaritas get their name from the flower they resemble (a daisy, known in Spanish as \"margarita\").\nOjitos [o\u02c8xitos]: A kind of round cookie with a space in the middle filled with dulce de membrillo, also from Uruguay.\nPan con grasa, another kind of bizcocho found in Uruguay, is a type of bread, also known as the ca\u00f1\u00f3n.\nPolvorones [pol\u03b2o\u02c8\u027eones]: Another kind of cookie that can be plain, flavoured with cocoa, or made with half plain dough and half cocoa flavoured. Polvorones originated in Spain.\nSponge Cake: sponge cake is called bizcocho in Spain. It may be  made with chocolate, lemon, yoghurt, etc.\nVigilantes [bixi\u02c8lantes]: Another sweet variation of croissants. They are long and thin, with sugar on top.\n\nIn Costa Rica, bizcochos are made with masa, spices, and/or cheese. They are eaten as a snack, especially during coffee breaks.\nIn Mexico, bizcocho is commonly used as a synonym for pan dulce. It can also be used as a flirtatious compliment to a good looking woman or, less commonly, a handsome man (\"Goodbye, bizcocho!\"). In some parts, however, it is a very vulgar term, referring to a person's genitals (mainly female) and not used in polite company.\nIn the Philippines, biscocho (also spelled biskotso) refers to class of breads (usually stale) that is baked again into a crunchy pastry.\nBizcochos are one of the most intrinsic traditions of the Uruguayan culture. They are the inseparable \"companions\" of mate, coffee, caf\u00e9 con leche, or tea for breakfast or the merienda (afternoon tea). They are also common in meetings with friends, especially those taking place in parks, squares, beaches or along the coastline in ramblas (an avenue bordering the coast with pedestrian areas on each side) such as the ones in Montevideo.\nBizcochos are sold not only at panader\u00edas (bakeries), but also at specialized shops called bizcocher\u00edas.\nAny type of cake, unless otherwise having a specific name (example: tres leches), is termed a bizcocho.\nList of cakes\nList of cookies\nList of pastries\nNocheseda, Elmer. \"Biscocho\".

                "description": "Guacamole is traditionally made by mashing peeled, ripe avocados and sea salt with a molcajete y tejolote (mortar and pestle). Recipes often call for lime juice, cilantro, onions, and jalapeos. Some non-traditional recipes may call for sour cream, tomatoes, basil, or peas. Due to the presence of polyphenol oxidase in the cells of avocado, exposure to oxygen in the air causes an enzymatic reaction and develops melanoidin pigment, turning the sauce brown. This result is generally considered unappetizing, and there are several methods (some anecdotal) that are used to counter this effect, such as storing the guacamole in an air-tight container or wrapping tightly in plastic to limit the surface area exposed to the air.",

Guacamole (Spanish:\u00a0[(\u0261)waka\u02c8mole] (listen); (informally shortened to guac in the United States since the 1980s) is an avocado-based dip, spread, or salad first developed in Mexico. In addition to its use in modern Mexican cuisine, it has become part of international and American cuisine as a dip, condiment and salad ingredient.\nThe name comes from Classical Nahuatl \u0101huacam\u014dlli [a\u02d0waka\u02c8mo\u02d0l\u02d0i], which literally translates to 'avocado sauce', from \u0101huacatl [a\u02d0\u02c8wakat\u0361\u026c] 'avocado' + m\u014dlli [\u02c8mo\u02d0l\u02d0i] 'sauce'. In Mexican Spanish, it is pronounced [waka\u02c8mole], in American English, it tends to be pronounced /\u02cc\u0261w\u0251\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8mo\u028ali\u02d0/, and in British English, /\u02cc\u0261w\u0251\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8mo\u028ale\u026a/.\nAvocados were first cultivated in South Central Mexico around 10,000 years ago. In the early 1900s, avocados frequently went by the name alligator pear.  In the 1697 book, A New Voyage Round the World, the first known description of a guacamole recipe (though not known by that name) was by English privateer and naturalist William Dampier, who in his visit to Central America during one of his circumnavigations, noted a native preparation made of grinding together avocados, sugar, and lime juice.\nGuacamole has increased avocado sales in the U.S., especially on Super Bowl Sunday and Cinco de Mayo. The rising consumption of guacamole is most likely due to the U.S. government lifting a ban on avocado imports in the 1990s and the growth of the U.S. Latino population.\nAs the major ingredient of guacamole is raw avocado, the nutritional value of the dish derives from avocado vitamins, minerals and fats, providing dietary fiber, several B vitamins, vitamin K, vitamin E and potassium in significant content (see Daily Value percentages in nutrient table for avocado). Avocados are a source of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and phytosterols, such as beta-sitosterol. They also contain carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, zeaxanthin and lutein.\n\nMantequilla de pobre (Spanish for '\"poor-man's butter\"') is a mixture of avocado, tomato, oil, and citrus juice. Despite its name, it predates the arrival of dairy cattle in the Americas, and thus was not originally made as a butter substitute.\nThinner and more acidic, or thick and chunky, guasacaca is a Venezuelan avocado-based sauce; it is made with vinegar, and is served over parrillas (grilled food), arepas, empanadas, and various other dishes. It is common to make the guasacaca with a little hot sauce instead of jalape\u00f1o, but like a guacamole, it is not usually served as a hot sauce itself. Pronounced \"wasakaka\" in Latin America.\nPrepared guacamoles are available in stores, often available refrigerated, frozen or in high pressure packaging which pasteurizes and extends shelf life if products are maintained at 1 to 4\u00a0\u00b0C (34 to 40\u00a0\u00b0F).\nNational Guacamole Day is celebrated on the same day as Mexican Independence Day, September 16.\nOn April 6, 2018, Junta Local de Sanidad Vegetal de Tanc\u00edtaro, Mexico, achieved the Guinness World Records for the largest serving of guacamole. They created it as part of Tanc\u00edtaro's 7th Annual Avocado Festival in Tanc\u00edtaro, Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. The serving weighed 3,788\u00a0kg (8,351 lb) and had more than 350 people help prepare it.\nAvocado sauce\nList of avocado dishes\nList of dips\nList of condiments\nList of Mexican dishes\nMole sauce\nSalsa (sauce)\n\"Oxford Dictionary\".

There is some variation in whether the term macaron or macaroon is used, and the related coconut macaroon is often confused with the macaron. In North America, most bakers have adopted the French spelling of macaron for the meringue-based item to distinguish the two. Stanford professor of linguistics Daniel Jurafsky describes how the two confections have a shared history with macaroni (Italian maccheroni, from Greek \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1). Jurafsky notes that French words ending with \"-on\" that were borrowed into English in the 16th and 17th centuries are usually spelled with \"-oon\" (for example: balloon, cartoon, platoon). In the UK, many bakeries continue to use the term \"macaroon\".\nAccording to Dan Jurafsky in Slate magazine, Arab troops from Ifr\u012bqiya (now Tunisia) brought new techniques (papermaking) and foods like lemons, rice and pistachios with them during their occupation of Sicily in 827.  These included many nut-based sweets such as F\u0101l\u016bdhaj and Lausinaj - baked goods with sweet almond cream inside.  These sweet pastries were handed down by the Sassanid Shahs in Persia, where the almond cake was made to celebrate the Zoroastrian New Year (Nouruz). In Sicily (and in Toledo, Spain, another contact point between Muslim and Christian culture) f\u0101l\u016bdhaj and lausinaj developed into various desserts, like the almond-paste tarts called marzapane and caliscioni.\nIn 1154 Muhammad al-Idrisi reported the production of noodles, which was also carried out in Sicily for the first time.  Under the collective term Maccarruni, the Arabs referred to ground grain products as noodles and pastries.  The Italians borrowed maccheroni from Maccarruni, from which today's macarons are derived. \nThe culinary encyclopedia Larousse Gastronomique (1988) traces the origin of the macarons back to a French monastery in Cormery in the 8th century (791). At the same time, the encyclopedia entry spreads the pious legend that the shape of the pastry with a cracked crust was abandoned from the navel of a monk.\nA Swiss online encyclopedia on the history of baking, on the other hand, dates the first almond biscuits to the 11th century under the aegis of the sultan and first king of the Almoravid dynasty Yusuf ibn Tashfin, where the almond cake Ghouryeba or Ghriba was served mainly during Ramadan.  The almond biscuits spread from Arabia to Sicily as far as Venice, where the term macarone was generally used to describe fine biscuits.\nMacarons have been produced in the Venetian monasteries since the 8th century A.D.  During the Renaissance, French queen Catherine de' Medici's Italian pastry chefs made them when she brought them with her to France in 1533 upon marrying Henry II of France. According to Larousse Gastronomique the macaron was created in 1791 in a convent near Cormery. In 1792, macarons began to gain fame when two Carmelite nuns, seeking asylum in Nancy during the French Revolution, baked and sold the macaron cookies in order to pay for their housing. These nuns became known as the \"Macaron Sisters\". In these early stages, macarons were served without special flavours or fillings.\nIt was not until the 1930s that macarons began to be served two-by-two with the addition of jams, liqueurs, and spices.  The macaron as it is known today, composed of two almond meringue discs filled with a layer of buttercream, jam, or ganache filling, was originally called the \"Gerbet\" or the \"Paris macaron.\"  Pierre Desfontaines, of the French p\u00e2tisserie Ladur\u00e9e, has sometimes been credited with its creation in the early part of the 20th century, but another baker, Claude Gerbet, also claims to have invented it. French macaron bakeries became trendy in North America in the 2010s.\nMany Italian cookbooks of the 16th-century mention almond biscuits closely resembling macarons, albeit under different names. The earliest known recipe dates back to the early 17th century and appears to be inspired by a French version of the recipe.\nTo make French Macaroones\n\nWash a pound of the newest and the best Jordane Almonds in three or foure waters, to take away the rednesse from their out-side, lay them in a Bason of warme water all night, the next day blanch them, and dry them with a faire cloath, beat them in a stone morter, until they be reasonably fine, put to them halfe a pound of fine beaten Sugar, and so beat it to a perfect Paste, then put in halfe a dozen spoonefuls of good Damaske Rose-water, three graines of Ambergreece, when you have beaten all this together, dry it on a chafingdish of coales until it grow white and stiffe, then take it off the",

In the UK, many bakeries continue to use the term \"macaroon\".\nAccording to Dan Jurafsky in Slate magazine, Arab troops from Ifr\u012bqiya (now Tunisia) brought new techniques (papermaking) and foods like lemons, rice and pistachios with them during their occupation of Sicily in 827.  These included many nut-based sweets such as F\u0101l\u016bdhaj and Lausinaj - baked goods with sweet almond cream inside.  These sweet pastries were handed down by the Sassanid Shahs in Persia, where the almond cake was made to celebrate the Zoroastrian New Year (Nouruz). In Sicily (and in Toledo, Spain, another contact point between Muslim and Christian culture) f\u0101l\u016bdhaj and lausinaj developed into various desserts, like the almond-paste tarts called marzapane and caliscioni.\nIn 1154 Muhammad al-Idrisi reported the production of noodles, which was also carried out in Sicily for the first time.  Under the collective term Maccarruni, the Arabs referred to ground grain products as noodles and pastries.  The Italians borrowed maccheroni from Maccarruni, from which today's macarons are derived. \nThe culinary encyclopedia Larousse Gastronomique (1988) traces the origin of the macarons back to a French monastery in Cormery in the 8th century (791). At the same time, the encyclopedia entry spreads the pious legend that the shape of the pastry with a cracked crust was abandoned from the navel of a monk.\nA Swiss online encyclopedia on the history of baking, on the other hand, dates the first almond biscuits to the 11th century under the aegis of the sultan and first king of the Almoravid dynasty Yusuf ibn Tashfin, where the almond cake Ghouryeba or Ghriba was served mainly during Ramadan.  The almond biscuits spread from Arabia to Sicily as far as Venice, where the term macarone was generally used to describe fine biscuits.\nMacarons have been produced in the Venetian monasteries since the 8th century A.D.  During the Renaissance, French queen Catherine de' Medici's Italian pastry chefs made them when she brought them with her to France in 1533 upon marrying Henry II of France. According to Larousse Gastronomique the macaron was created in 1791 in a convent near Cormery. In 1792, macarons began to gain fame when two Carmelite nuns, seeking asylum in Nancy during the French Revolution, baked and sold the macaron cookies in order to pay for their housing. These nuns became known as the \"Macaron Sisters\". In these early stages, macarons were served without special flavours or fillings.\nIt was not until the 1930s that macarons began to be served two-by-two with the addition of jams, liqueurs, and spices.  The macaron as it is known today, composed of two almond meringue discs filled with a layer of buttercream, jam, or ganache filling, was originally called the \"Gerbet\" or the \"Paris macaron.\"  Pierre Desfontaines, of the French p\u00e2tisserie Ladur\u00e9e, has sometimes been credited with its creation in the early part of the 20th century, but another baker, Claude Gerbet, also claims to have invented it. French macaron bakeries became trendy in North America in the 2010s.\nMany Italian cookbooks of the 16th-century mention almond biscuits closely resembling macarons, albeit under different names. The earliest known recipe dates back to the early 17th century and appears to be inspired by a French version of the recipe.\nTo make French Macaroones\n\nWash a pound of the newest and the best Jordane Almonds in three or foure waters, to take away the rednesse from their out-side, lay them in a Bason of warme water all night, the next day blanch them, and dry them with a faire cloath, beat them in a stone morter, until they be reasonably fine, put to them halfe a pound of fine beaten Sugar, and so beat it to a perfect Paste, then put in halfe a dozen spoonefuls of good Damaske Rose-water, three graines of Ambergreece, when you have beaten all this together, dry it on a chafingdish of coales until it grow white and stiffe, then take it off the",

Brunswick stew is a tomato-based stew generally involving local beans, vegetables, and originally small game meat such as squirrel or rabbit, though today often chicken. The exact origin of the stew is disputed. The states of Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia all claim its birth, with Brunswick County in Virginia and the city of Brunswick in Georgia both claiming it was developed there.  It may have originated earlier in some form in the city of Braunschweig (English: Brunswick) in the  Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg in today's northern Germany.\nThe stew's specific origin is unknown.  Brunswick County, Virginia,  and the city of Brunswick, Georgia, both named after the German Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, then home to the House of Hanover which ruled the British throne, claim to have created it.\nA plaque on an old iron pot in Brunswick, Georgia, says the first Brunswick stew was made in it on July 2, 1898, on nearby St. Simons Island. A competing story claims a Virginia state legislator's chef invented the recipe in 1828 on a hunting expedition.  Neither claim traces to the origin of those regions.\nMarjorie Kinnan Rawlings, in her Cross Creek Cookery (1942), wrote that the stew, said to have been one of Queen Victoria's favorites, may have come from Braunschweig, Germany, one of the historic capitals of the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg and traditionally known as \"Brunswick\" in British English.\nList of stews\nClayton, B.

Chikanda is a Zambian dish made from the boiled root tubers of terrestrial orchids also called chikanda. The dish is often called \"African polony\" because it has a texture that resembles bologna. Chikanda can be eaten as a snack, dessert, or an accompaniment to nshima, a maize flour porridge.\nChikanda has been eaten for hundreds of years by people in parts of Zambia, northern Malawi, and southwestern Tanzania. The dish is traditionally associated with the Bemba tribe in northeast Zambia, although it is eaten throughout Zambia today. For the Bemba, it is an integral part of the culture and is served at special occasions such as weddings. Originally a food in the setting of rural scarcity, it has now shifted to an urban trend.  Now, chikanda can be found being sold by street vendors, supermarkets, and large restaurants as the urban population has an increased demand for this rural tradition.\nIn Malawi, it is thought that eating the dish will protect against sickness.\nIn southwestern Tanzania, a similar dish called kinaka in Kiswahili are eaten by the Nyamwanga, Nyika, Nyiha, Fipa, Lungu, and Ndali.\nThe tubers are dried and pounded. Then, a mixture of the dried brown orchid meal and groundnut meal are boiled to form a slurry. Dried chili peppers can also be added. The slurry is thickened by soda, salted, and flavored with spices. As it simmers, the slurry thickens into a cake and rises like dough. It is usually served sliced.\nThe orchid roots grow wild throughout Zambia. However, due to the high demand, this had led to the present scarcity of the orchids in the country. Now, they are illegally imported from Tanzania, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, leading to the risk of overharvesting abroad. Traditional sustainability practices included only harvested tubers that have spread their seed and replanting stalks. However, the locals have abandoned these practices due to increased demand. Unfortunately, the orchids are difficult to cultivate in captivity. Current efforts for conservation focus on cultivating the threatened orchids.\nA similar issue with unsustainable harvesting of orchids is noted with the Turkish trade in salep, a starch used in dessert and beverages.\nJoshi, D.D.

A bouillon cube /\u02c8bu\u02d0j\u0252n/ (Canada and US),  stock cube (Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and UK), broth cube (Asia) or stock pot (UK) is dehydrated broth or stock formed into a small cube about 13\u00a0mm (1\u20442\u00a0in) wide. It is typically made from dehydrated vegetables, meat stock, a small portion of fat, MSG, salt, and seasonings, shaped into a small cube. Vegetarian and vegan types are also made. Bouillon is also available in granular, powdered, liquid, and paste forms.\nDehydrated meat stock, in the form of tablets, was known in the 17th century to English food writer Anne Blencowe, who died in 1718, and elsewhere as early as 1735. Various French cooks in the early 19th century (Lefesse, Massu\u00e9, and Martin) tried to patent bouillon cubes and tablets, but were turned down for lack of originality. Nicolas Appert also proposed such dehydrated bouillon in 1831.\nPortable soup was a kind of dehydrated food used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a precursor of meat extract and bouillon cubes, and of industrially dehydrated food. It is also known as pocket soup or veal glue. It is a cousin of the glace de viande of French cooking. It was long a staple of seamen and explorers, for it would keep for many months or even years. In this context, it was a filling and nutritious dish. Portable soup of less extended vintage was, according to the 1881 Household Cyclopedia,\n\"exceedingly convenient for private families, for by putting one of the cakes in a saucepan with about a quart of water, and a little salt, a basin of good broth may be made in a few minutes.\"\nIn the mid-19th century, German chemist Justus von Liebig developed meat extract, but it was more expensive than bouillon cubes.\nThe invention of the bouillon cube is also attributed to Auguste Escoffier, one of the most accomplished French chefs of his time, who also pioneered many other advances in food preservation, such as the canning of tomatoes and vegetables.\nIndustrially produced bouillon cubes were commercialized by Maggi in 1908, by Oxo in 1910, and by Knorr in 1912. By 1913, at least 10 brands were available, with salt contents of 59\u201372%.\nContrary to popular belief, stock cubes are not made by \"drying out stock\", but by mixing already dry ingredients into a paste. The ingredients are usually mixed in a container (batch mixing), left to mature, and then shaped into the cube form. Alternatively, they can be mixed directly into an extruder.\nList of dried foods\nPortable soup\nJoan Thirsk, \u2018Blencowe , Anne, Lady Blencowe (1656\u20131718)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2005; online edn, Jan 2007 accessed 17 Nov 2016\nVincent La Chapelle, Le cuisinier moderne, as cited in Davis\nJennifer Davis, Defining Culinary Authority: The Transformation of Cooking in France, 1650-1830, Louisiana State University Press, 2013, p. 154f\n\"Culinary Arts: Plain Cookery\", Household Cyclopedia Archived 2013-03-28 at the Wayback Machine, 1881.\nAuguste Escoffier: Founder of Modern Cuisine; online https://www.iwfs.org/americas/wine-food---friends-1/articles/auguste-escoffier--founder-of-modern-cuisine\nCook, F.

Maple sugar is a traditional sweetener in Canada and the northeastern United States, prepared from the sap of the maple tree (\"maple sap\").\nThree species of maple trees in the genus Acer are predominantly used to produce maple sugar: the sugar maple (A. saccharum), the black maple (A. nigrum), and the red maple (A. rubrum), because of the high sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species. The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of A. saccharum, the sugar maple, by some botanists.  Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavor of the sap.\nA few other species of maple are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple sugar, including the box elder (or Manitoba maple, A. negundo), the silver maple (A. saccharinum), and the bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum). Similar sugars may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.\nIn Canada, maple sugar is one of several maple products manufactured from maple sap or maple syrup, including maple butter and maple taffy. Under the Food and Drugs Act and Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, Canadian regulations require that maple sugar products identify the business identity and country of origin on the retail product label.\nMaple sugar was the preferred form of sugar by First Nations/American Indian peoples as the sugar could easily be transported and lasted a long time. It is called ziinzibaakwad by the Anishinaabeg. Blessing of the Bay, the second ocean-going merchant ship built in the English colonies, carried maple sugar from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to New Amsterdam as early as 1631.

Dodol is a sweet toffee-like sugar palm-based confection commonly found in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Originating from the culinary traditions of Indonesia, it is also popular in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, the Philippines, South India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma, where it is called mont kalama. It is made from coconut milk, jaggery, and rice flour, and is sticky, thick, and sweet.\nThe history of dodol production is closely related to one of its main ingredients, gula aren or palm sugar, a traditional sugar made from the sap of Arenga pinnata plant, and also rice flour. It is a popular sweet treat and one of the oldest indigenous sweets developed in the Maritime Southeast Asia. The exact origin of dodol is unclear; while there is a remarkable diversity in preparations of the product within the island communities of Java and Sumatra, the variants tend to be adaptations of post-colonial crops. \"Dodol\" is a word of Sundanese origin, whereas in Javanese it is called jenang.\nDodol is believed to have been introduced to Southern India and Sri Lanka by migrants from Indonesia. It has also been attributed to the Portuguese, who occupied parts of the country during the 16th and 17th centuries. Several dodol recipes have been developed in Sri Lanka, such as kalu dodol. Dodol is very famous recipe in kilakarai, Tamil Nadu.It was possibly believed to introduce by Sri Lankan Muslim immigrants.\nIn Muslim majority countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, dodol is commonly served during festivals, such as Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha as sweet treats for children. The Betawi people take pride in making homemade dodol during the Lebaran (Eid ul-Fitr), where family members will gather together to make dodol. Traditional home made dodol Betawi production center is located in Pasar Minggu area, South Jakarta.\nDodol is also popular among the Roman Catholics from the Indian west coast, also known as the former Estado da \u00cdndia Portuguesa, which includes East Indians from Mumbai, the state of Goa, and the city of Mangalore. Dodol Hj Ideris manufactures dodol and the company has now entered the Middle Eastern market, including Iran.\nA related dessert in the Philippines is known as kalamay (literally \"sugar\"), which is made from sugarcane sugar instead of palm sugar. It also has a liquid consistency unlike dodol, since it uses ground glutinous rice rather than rice flour. However, the basic ingredients and preparation is similar. In Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago of the southern Philippines, dodol is more similar to the Indonesian and Malaysian variants and is known by the same name. It is usually prepared into thick cylinders wrapped in corn husks or coloured cellophane that is then cut into disks before serving. Although, like the kalamay, Filipino dodol is made with ground glutinous rice paste and muscovado sugarcane sugar, not palm sugar.\n\nThere is a diverse variety of dodol recipes found in Indonesia. The town of Garut in West Java is the main production center of dodol in Indonesia. Many flavours of dodol are available, including a durian flavor called lempuk, which is popular in Medan and other Sumatran cities. A major producer of Garut-style dodol incorporates chocolate as an ingredient into a specialized variant product, with the intention of producing edible souvenirs from the city called 'chocodot' or chocolate dodol.\nOther variants include:\nDodol bengkoang contains jicama.\nDodol kacang hijau contains mung beans.\nDodol tape contains tapai, a fermented rice product\nDodol ubi talam contains yam.\nDodol sirsak contains soursop.\nDodol nangka contains jackfruit.\nDodol lidah buaya contains aloe vera.\nDodol apel Malang contains apple, and is a speciality of Malang city, East Java.\nDodol susu is from Pangalengan, Bandung, West Java. It contains milk.\nDodol tomat contains tomato.\nDodol salak contains salak.\nDodol rumput laut contains seaweed.\nDodol pisang contains banana.\nDodol nenas contains pineapple.\nDodol mangga contains mango.\nDodol China is an Indonesian Chinese version of sweet nian gao with rich coconut sugar.\nDodol Betawi is made by the Betawi people in Jakarta from a mixture of white and black glutinous rice.\nIn colloquial Indonesian, dodol can also be used as a slang term for the word 'bodoh' to refer a person as being 'stupid' or 'illogical'. It is impolite to refer a person as 'dodol'.\nMochi\nCaramel candy\nButterscotch\nKalamay\nNian gao\nKulolo\nWibisono Notodirdjo (7 August 2011). \"Sweet treats from the past\". The Jakarta Post.

It is a sweetened condensed milk made by boiling milk on low heat until the milk is reduced by half. In North India, a similar dish goes by the name rabri.\nIt is often made on Hindu festivals such as Kali Chaudas and Bhaubeej (Bhai Dooj).\nDifferent styles of basundi are also prepared, such as sitaphal (custard apple) basundi and angoor basundi (basundi with smaller kinds of rasgullas).\nBasundi can be served hot, warm or chilled. It is often served with puris (fried Indian flatbread).\nThis milk that is flavored with cardamom powder and saffron basundi varies as per the quantity of saffron. Add less for mild colour. The addition of condensed milk gives a nice flavour and wealth to basundi.\nMilk - Milk provides daily allowance of Calcium. The calcium in milk protects teeth and bones.Protein is another key nutrient which milk is rich in - 8.6g.\nAlmonds - Almonds are rich in B complex vitamins such as Vitamin B1, Vitamin B3, Thiamine, Niacine and Folate which plays an important role in brain development.\n\nNarsobawadi Basundi is a variant from Narsobawadi, Maharashtra. It is a sweetened dense milk made by boiling milk on low heat until the milk is reduced \nThe area near Narsobawadi and Sangli is having ample amount of milk. The business in Narsobawadi of Basundi has grown against that. The milk is collected from farmers and is boiled in the kadhai till it reduces water content by half. The milk becomes thick and changes colour becomes off white. The sugar is added to get the taste and it is then packed and dispatched to the various dairy and milk product centers for sale. Basundi is an perishable item so needs to be preserved carefully. This item needs to be consumed with in 2\u20133 days from the date of manufacturing.\nHeavy cream may be added during the boiling process to hasten the thickening process. Once reduced, a little sugar, cardamom, charoli and/or saffron are added. Basundi is preserved well after sugar is added. Sugar develops some acidity over a period of time. If it is excessive then it can curdle the basundi. Some times after adding sugar one cooks it for some more time; this gives a nice pink color to basundi, as sugar is also cooked in milk turning into a light caramel. Before adding sugar, basundi is thick but after adding it becomes again fluid. Stirring well prevents from malai being formed on top and all guests (even late comers) can enjoy equally thick and plain basundi.

It is a string of walnut halves that have been dipped in grape juice called Tatara or Phelamushi (grape juice thickened with flour), and dried in the sun. No sugar is added to make real Churchkhela. Instead of walnuts, sometimes hazelnuts or almonds are used in the regions of west Georgia. The shape of Churchkhela looks like a candle. Georgian warriors carried Churchkhelas with them because they contain many calories. The best Churchkhela is made in Kakheti region, which is renowned as the motherland of wine.

Churchkhela (Georgian: \u10e9\u10e3\u10e0\u10e9\u10ee\u10d4\u10da\u10d0, [t\u0283\u02b0urt\u0283\u02b0x\u025bl\u0251]) is a traditional Georgian cuisine candle-shaped candy. The main ingredients are grape must, nuts, and flour. Almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, and chocolate and sometimes raisins are threaded onto a string, dipped in thickened grape juice or fruit juices and dried in the shape of a sausage. The traditional technology of churchkhela in the Kakheti region was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2015.\nChurchkhela and its varieties are popular in several countries besides Georgia, such as Syria \"Aleppo\" as known as zob alkadi \u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0636\u064a, Iran, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Cyprus, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Pakistan and Turkey. In Persian, it's known as \u0628\u0627\u0633\u0644\u0648\u0642 \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0631. In Armenian, Greek, and Turkish it is known as \"sujuk\", which is actually a dry sausage. To distinguish the two, it is sometimes referred to as \"sweet sujukh\" (\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0581\u0580 \u057d\u0578\u0582\u057b\u0578\u0582\u056d, kaghtsr sujukh) in Armenian and cevizli sucuk (\"walnut sujuk\") in Turkish. It is known in Cypriot Greek as shoushoukos (\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2) and as soutzouki (\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03ba\u03b9) in Greece. A variant of Churchkhela, traditionally called Kelawo, is prepared in the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan. It was locally marketed as Hunza chocolate, but as Kelawo does not contain any cocoa, it is now renamed as Hunza Candy.\nThe Cypriot variety is made by dipping strings of almonds into jelly, called palouzes (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03ad\u03c2).\nChurchkhela is a between-meals snack and is also served as a dessert during New Year and Christmas celebrations.\nTraditionally, in times of war women would send their men Churchkhela to eat at the front, because of its pragmatic size, ability not to mold for long periods of time, and heavy texture that keeps one full.\n\nGozinaki\nList of grape dishes\nPestil\nGoldstein, Darra (1999).

Maple sugar is a traditional sweetener in Canada and the northeastern United States, prepared from the sap of the maple tree (\"maple sap\").\nThree species of maple trees in the genus Acer are predominantly used to produce maple sugar: the sugar maple (A. saccharum), the black maple (A. nigrum), and the red maple (A. rubrum), because of the high sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species. The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of A. saccharum, the sugar maple, by some botanists.  Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavor of the sap.\nA few other species of maple are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple sugar, including the box elder (or Manitoba maple, A. negundo), the silver maple (A. saccharinum), and the bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum). Similar sugars may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.\nIn Canada, maple sugar is one of several maple products manufactured from maple sap or maple syrup, including maple butter and maple taffy. Under the Food and Drugs Act and Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, Canadian regulations require that maple sugar products identify the business identity and country of origin on the retail product label.\nMaple sugar was the preferred form of sugar by First Nations/American Indian peoples as the sugar could easily be transported and lasted a long time. It is called ziinzibaakwad by the Anishinaabeg. Blessing of the Bay, the second ocean-going merchant ship built in the English colonies, carried maple sugar from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to New Amsterdam as early as 1631. French awareness of the process is indicated in at least one engraver's works, those of the mid-18th-century artist Jean-Francois Turpin, the engraver Bernard (including several for Diderot's 1755 Encyclopedie.) and others.\nMaple sugar is used to flavor maple products and as an alternative to cane sugar.\nMaple syrup\nList of foods made from maple\nElliot 2006, pp.\u00a08\u201310.\nCiesla 2002, pp.\u00a037\u201338.\n\"Acer saccharum subsp. nigrum\".

Once almost all the water has been boiled off, all that is left is a solid sugar. By composition, this sugar is about 90% sucrose, the remainder consisting of variable amounts of glucose and fructose. This is usually sold in pressed blocks or as a translucent candy. It is difficult to create as the sugar easily burns and thus requires considerable skill.",

Maple sugar is a traditional sweetener in Canada and the northeastern United States, prepared from the sap of the maple tree (\"maple sap\").\nThree species of maple trees in the genus Acer are predominantly used to produce maple sugar: the sugar maple (A. saccharum), the black maple (A. nigrum), and the red maple (A. rubrum), because of the high sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species. The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of A. saccharum, the sugar maple, by some botanists.  Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavor of the sap.\nA few other species of maple are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple sugar, including the box elder (or Manitoba maple, A. negundo), the silver maple (A. saccharinum), and the bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum). Similar sugars may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.\nIn Canada, maple sugar is one of several maple products manufactured from maple sap or maple syrup, including maple butter and maple taffy. Under the Food and Drugs Act and Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, Canadian regulations require that maple sugar products identify the business identity and country of origin on the retail product label.\nMaple sugar was the preferred form of sugar by First Nations/American Indian peoples as the sugar could easily be transported and lasted a long time. It is called ziinzibaakwad by the Anishinaabeg. Blessing of the Bay, the second ocean-going merchant ship built in the English colonies, carried maple sugar from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to New Amsterdam as early as 1631. French awareness of the process is indicated in at least one engraver's works, those of the mid-18th-century artist Jean-Francois Turpin, the engraver Bernard (including several for Diderot's 1755 Encyclopedie.) and others.\nMaple sugar is used to flavor maple products and as an alternative to cane sugar.\nMaple syrup\nList of foods made from maple\nElliot 2006, pp.\u00a08\u201310.\nCiesla 2002, pp.\u00a037\u201338.\n\"Acer saccharum subsp. nigrum\".

Scrapple, also known by the Pennsylvania Dutch name Pannhaas (\"pan hare\" in English), is traditionally a mush of pork scraps and trimmings combined with cornmeal and wheat flour, often buckwheat flour, and spices.  The mush is formed into a semi-solid congealed loaf, and slices of the scrapple are then pan-fried before serving. Scraps of meat left over from butchering, not used or sold elsewhere, were made into scrapple to avoid waste. Scrapple is best known as an American food of the southern Mid-Atlantic states (Delaware, Maryland, South Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia). \nScrapple and panhaas are commonly considered an ethnic food of the Pennsylvania Dutch, including the Mennonites and Amish. Scrapple is found in supermarkets throughout the region in both fresh and frozen refrigerated cases.\nScrapple is typically made of hog offal, such as the head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to the pot and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning are very much a matter of the region and the cook's taste.\nA few manufacturers have introduced beef and turkey varieties and color the loaf to retain the traditional coloration derived from the original pork liver base.\nDue to its composition, it is often jokingly described as being made from \"everything but the oink\".\nEtymologically, \"scrapple\" is a diminutive of \"scrap\", a reference to its composition.\nThe roots of the culinary traditions that led to the development of scrapple in America have been traced back to pre-Roman Europe. The more immediate culinary ancestor of scrapple was the Low German dish called panhas, which was adapted to make use of locally available ingredients, and it is still called \"Pannhaas,\" \"panhoss,\" \"ponhoss,\" or \"pannhas\" in parts of Pennsylvania. The first recipes were created by German colonists who settled near Philadelphia and Chester County, Pennsylvania in the 17th and 18th centuries. As a result, scrapple is strongly associated with areas surrounding Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Washington, D.C.; Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Southern New York, and the Delmarva Peninsula. Its popularity on the Delmarva Peninsula is celebrated the second weekend of October during the annual \"Apple Scrapple Festival\" in Bridgeville, Delaware.\nThe two largest brands of scrapple in Philadelphia are Habbersett and Rapa, controlling approximately half and one-quarter of the market respectively.  Rapa accounts for about three-quarters of the Baltimore market.\nThe title of jazz artist Charlie Parker's 1947 composition \"Scrapple from the Apple\" is inspired by the food scrapple, in the Big Apple (New York City).\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nFoods\nBalkenbrij, a traditional Dutch food that shares some of the characteristics of scrapple\nFaggot, an English dish made of meat off-cuts and offal, especially pork\nGoetta, a meat-and-grain sausage or mush of German inspiration, popular near Cincinnati\nGroaty pudding, in England, made from soaked groats, beef, leeks, onion and beef stock which is then baked\nHaggis, a traditional Scottish savory pudding containing sheep's pluck (heart, liver, and lungs), minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock\nH\u00e1karl, a national dish of Iceland consisting of a Greenland shark or other sleeper shark which has been cured with a particular fermentation process and hung to dry for four to five months\nHaslet, in England, a pork meatloaf with herbs\nHead cheese, a dish made from meat scraps traditionally (though not exclusively) derived from an animal's head\nLivermush, in the United States, a dish of pig liver, head parts, and cornmeal\nLorne sausage, a traditional Scottish food usually made from minced meat, rusk and spices\nMeatloaf, a dish of ground meat mixed with other ingredients and formed into a loaf shape, then baked or smoked\nPork roll, pork-based processed meat available in parts of the northeastern United States\nSlatur, an Icelandic food made from the innards of sheep\nWeckewerk, in Germany, a sausage made from cooked brawn and minced meat, veal or sausage, and broth of pork, sometimes from cooked meat, blood and offal\nPennsylvania Folklife 22.

                "description": "Balbacua has numerous variations when it comes to the spices and secondary ingredients used. A common aspect of the dish, however, is the use of collagen-rich parts of beef, including oxtail, skin, knuckles, and other cartilaginous beef cuts in addition to regular beef cuts. These are cooked for around four to six hours until the meat is falling off the bones and is very tender. The collagen from the skin and cartilage thickens the soup into a gelatinous consistency. ...",

Balbacua, also spelled balbakwa or balbakoa, is a Filipino beef stew made from beef, collagen-rich beef parts (oxtail, skin, and joints), and various spices cooked for several hours until very tender. It is typically served with white rice or misua or miki noodles. It originates from the Visayan regions of the Visayas and Mindanao islands.\nThe name balbacua is derived from the Latin American dish barbacoa (which is also the source of the English word \"barbecue\"), though they are very different dishes. While balbacua is a beef stew, barbacoa is instead meat roasted in a pit. The dish was probably named by the Spanish due to the similarity in the length of time in cooking and the tenderness of the meat.\nKare-kare\nMitsado\nKaldereta\nList of beef dishes\nList of stews\n\"King's Balbakwa: comfort food in Zamboanga City\".

Burgoo is a stew, similar to Irish or Mulligan stew, often served with cornbread or corn muffins.  It is often prepared communally as a social gathering. It is popular as the basis for civic fund-raisers in the American Midwest and South.\nThe term is of uncertain origin, possibly from the combination of the Welsh words for \"yeast\" and \"cabbage\".\nCooking burgoo in Kentucky often serves as a communal effort and social event in which each attendee brings one or more ingredients. In Kentucky and surrounding states such as Indiana, burgoo is often used for school fund-raising. This has been claimed as an invention of the family of Ollie Beard, a former Major League Baseball player.\nMany places hold great pride in their burgoo, and it is a common feature in local events. The village of Arenzville, Illinois asserts itself as the home of the world's best burgoo and holds a yearly burgoo festival, as does Chandlerville, Illinois, in Cass County and Utica, IL in LaSalle County. Several cities claim to be the burgoo capital of the world, including Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, Owensboro, Kentucky, and Franklin, Illinois. In Brighton, Illinois, a local traditional burgoo is prepared and served annually at the village's summer festival, the Betsey Ann Picnic.

The Larousse Gastronomique claims \"according to the purists, the different vegetables should be cooked separately, then combined and cooked slowly together until they attain a smooth, creamy consistency\", so that (according to the chair of the Larousse's committee Jol Robuchon) \"each [vegetable] will taste truly of itself.\"",

Recipes and cooking times differ widely, but common ingredients include tomato, garlic, onion, courgette (zucchini), aubergine (eggplant), capsicum (bell pepper), and some combination of leafy green herbs common to the region.\nThe word ratatouille derives from the Occitan ratatolha and is related to the French ratouiller and tatouiller, expressive forms of the verb touiller, meaning \"to stir up\". From the late 18th century, in French, it merely indicated a coarse stew. The modern ratatouille\u00a0\u2013 tomatoes as a foundation for saut\u00e9ed garlic, onion, zucchini, aubergine (eggplant), bell pepper, marjoram, fennel and basil, or bay leaf and thyme, or a mix of green herbs like herbes de Provence\u00a0\u2013 does not appear in print until c.\u00a01930.\nSimilar dishes exist in many cuisines.  These include: pisto (Castilian-Manchego, Spain), samfaina (Catalan, Spain),  tombet (Majorcan), ciambotta, caponata and peperonata (Italy and Tunisia),  bri\u00e1m and tourlo\u00fa (Greek), \u015fak\u015fuka and t\u00fcrl\u00fc (Turkish), ajapsandali (Georgian), lecs\u00f3 (Hungarian), ghiveci (Romanian) and zaalouk (Moroccan). Different parts of the Indian subcontinent have their own versions of winter vegetable stew. Gujarat makes undhiyu, Kerala avial, and Bengal shukto. Confit byaldi can be considered as variation of the dish.\nIn 2007 Disney released the film Ratatouille. The film features Remy, a young rat with an exceptional sense of taste and smell, and dreams of becoming a chef. The movie gave widespread exposure of this meal to American culture and the world.\nFrench tian\nList of stews\nList of vegetable dishes\nShakshouka\n\"Ratatouille\".

The taquito or small taco was referred to in the 1917 Preliminary Glossary of New Mexico Spanish, with the word noted as a \"Mexicanism\" used in New Mexico. The modern definition of a taquito as a rolled-tortilla dish was given in 1929 in a book of stories of Mexican people in the United States aimed at a youth audience, where the dish was noted as a particularly popular offering of railroad station vendors. Taquitos were referred to, without definition, in a 1932 issue of the Los Angeles School Journal.\nTwo Southern California restaurants are often given credit for their roles in the early development of the taquito. Cielito Lindo was founded by Aurora Guerrero in 1934 and located on Olvera Street in Los Angeles. Guerrero's daughter used her taquito recipe in opening chain restaurants in Los Angeles, and soon competitors were selling similar dishes. In San Diego, what would become El Indio Mexican Restaurant began selling taquitos during World War II, when tortilla factory owner Ralph Pesqueria, Sr., was asked by workers at the Consolidated Aircraft Company factory across the street for a portable lunch item. Pesqueria, who used a recipe developed by his Mexican grandmother, has claimed credit for introducing the word \"taquito\" for the dish.\nTaquitos were among the early Mexican food items developed as a frozen food, with Van de Kamp introducing a successful frozen taquito offering by 1976. The United States government has determined that taquitos must contain at least 15% meat.\nCrispy fried taquitos sold in Mexico are often called tacos dorados (\"golden tacos\") or flautas. Typical toppings and sides include cabbage, crema (Mexican sour cream), guacamole, green chili or red chili salsa and crumbled Mexican cheese such as queso fresco.\n\"Taquitos\" in the Mexican border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali refer to small tacos sold in stands, rather than the rolled taco dish.\nBurrito\nList of Mexican dishes\nList of stuffed dishes\nList of tortilla-based dishes\nTaco\nBarcia, Roque (1883).

                "description": "Tejuno is a cold beverage made from fermented corn and popularly consumed in the Mexican states of Jalisco and Chihuahua. Tejuino is usually made from corn dough, the same kind used for tortillas and tamales. The dough is mixed with water and piloncillo (cone-shaped unrefined cane sugar) and boiled until the liquid is very thick. The liquid is then allowed to ferment very slightly. The resulting drink is generally served cold, with lime juice, a pinch of salt and a scoop of shaved ice or lime sorbet.

The exact origin of Tejuino is disputed; however, most Mexicans agree that the drink dates back to pre-Columbian times. The ancient Nahua people of Mexico viewed Tejuino as the \"drink of the gods\" and it is still called this by some Mexicans today.\nWithin the state of Jalisco there are variations as to how it is served. In Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, for example, tejuino is served without nieve de limon; in Guadalajara, Jalisco, it is usually served with nieve de limon, at the buyer's discretion. Nieve de limon is a homemade lime sorbet that is often added to the drink to bring out its natural flavor.\nSince tejuino is only allowed to ferment for a couple of days at most, the alcohol content is actually very low. There is a common myth among Mexicans that one can get drunk from drinking too much tejuino; however, this is usually due to the addition of small amounts of beer in some recipes rather than the alcohol content of the tejuino itself.\n\nBoza\nTesg\u00fcino\nPozol\nTepache\nMalt beer\nAmazake\nList of maize dishes\n\"Cold Drinks, Mexican style\". 2007-03-04.

It is also popularly known as kue cucur tipis (lit: thin cucur), which is different from the thicker kue cucur, and colloquially known as kue tetek (breast cake or boobscake) due to its shape that resembles a nipple. Because it is deemed inappropriate to say tetek, most Indonesians just say kue ape as in what cake?. It is also very similar to serabi Solo.",

The mixed batter is cooked in a small serabi wok or frying pan, greased with palm oil, margarine or butter. The parabolic shape of small serabi wok would create thick and fluffy center where the batter concentrate, and also creating crispy thinner skin radiating around the cake. Together with kue cubit which also employ similar batter, kue ape is a popular snack among school children and commonly sold in marketplaces.\nSerabi\nKue cucur\nKue cubit\n\"Kue Ape\" (in Indonesian).

                "description": "A taquito ([takito], Spanish for \"small taco\"), tacos dorados,rolled taco, or flauta ([flawta], Spanish for \"flute\") is a Mexican food dish that typically consists of a small rolled-up tortilla that contains  filling, including beef, cheese or chicken. The filled tortilla is then crisp-fried or deep-fried. The dish is often topped with condiments such as sour cream and guacamole. Corn tortillas are generally used to make taquitos. The dish is more commonly known as flautas when they are larger than their taquito counterparts, and can be made with either flour or corn tortillas.",

The taquito or small taco was referred to in the 1917 Preliminary Glossary of New Mexico Spanish, with the word noted as a \"Mexicanism\" used in New Mexico. The modern definition of a taquito as a rolled-tortilla dish was given in 1929 in a book of stories of Mexican people in the United States aimed at a youth audience, where the dish was noted as a particularly popular offering of railroad station vendors. Taquitos were referred to, without definition, in a 1932 issue of the Los Angeles School Journal.\nTwo Southern California restaurants are often given credit for their roles in the early development of the taquito. Cielito Lindo was founded by Aurora Guerrero in 1934 and located on Olvera Street in Los Angeles. Guerrero's daughter used her taquito recipe in opening chain restaurants in Los Angeles, and soon competitors were selling similar dishes. In San Diego, what would become El Indio Mexican Restaurant began selling taquitos during World War II, when tortilla factory owner Ralph Pesqueria, Sr., was asked by workers at the Consolidated Aircraft Company factory across the street for a portable lunch item. Pesqueria, who used a recipe developed by his Mexican grandmother, has claimed credit for introducing the word \"taquito\" for the dish.\nTaquitos were among the early Mexican food items developed as a frozen food, with Van de Kamp introducing a successful frozen taquito offering by 1976. The United States government has determined that taquitos must contain at least 15% meat.\nCrispy fried taquitos sold in Mexico are often called tacos dorados (\"golden tacos\") or flautas. Typical toppings and sides include cabbage, crema (Mexican sour cream), guacamole, green chili or red chili salsa and crumbled Mexican cheese such as queso fresco.\n\"Taquitos\" in the Mexican border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali refer to small tacos sold in stands, rather than the rolled taco dish.\nBurrito\nList of Mexican dishes\nList of stuffed dishes\nList of tortilla-based dishes\nTaco\nBarcia, Roque (1883).

Salt-rising bread is made from wheat flour; a starter consisting of either water or milk and corn, potatoes, or wheat; and minor ingredients such as salt and sugar. Salt in the name is a misnomer; the bread is not leavened by salt nor does it taste salty. One explanation for the name of the bread is that the starter was kept warm in a bed of heated salt. ...",

The exact origin of this bread is unknown, but evidence suggests that it was the pioneer women in early American states who discovered how to make bread this way. Commercial yeast was not available until the 1860s. Currently, the tradition of making salt-rising bread is kept alive by relatively few individuals and bakeries that tend to be clustered in the central to eastern United States. It is particularly popular in Kentucky, West Virginia, Southern Tier of New York, Western Pennsylvania and pockets in Michigan.\nOne of the main rising agents, the bacterium Clostridium perfringens, is a common cause of food poisoning and can cause enteritis necroticans (pig-bel disease) and gas gangrene. Although disease-causing strains of C. perfringens have been isolated from salt-rising breads, there is no indication of salt-rising bread having ever caused any human disease. The baking process appears to reduce bacteria to safe levels.\nJuckett, G; Bardwell, G; McClane, B; Brown, S (2008). \"Microbiology of salt rising bread\".

Typically, the ice was mixed with saffron, grape juices, fruits, and other flavours. The Greek leader Alexander the Great, who battled the Persians for ten years, enjoyed \"fruit ices\" sweetened with honey and chilled with snow.\nIn 400 BCE, the Persians also invented a sorbet made with rose water and vermicelli called faloodeh (Persian: \u067e\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062f\u0647\u200e).

Unlike many other Thai curries, traditional kaeng pa usually contains no coconut milk, as coconuts are not naturally found in the rainforests in the northern part of the country. This quality makes it more suitable for people on low saturated fat diets. There are, however, variants that do include coconut. Kaeng pa is a highly spicy and watery curry that has a distinctive full taste. Ingredients usually include: kaffir lime peel and leaves, lemongrass, green pepper corns, galangal, garlic, pea eggplant and chilli. It was originally prepared with wild boar, but is now more commonly prepared with pork or chicken.",

In a New Haven-style pizzeria, a \"plain\" pizza is a crust, oregano, tomato sauce, and  a little bit of grated pecorino romano cheese. A \"plain\" New Haven-style pizza may also be called a \"tomato pie\". Mozzarella is considered a topping.\nPepe's restaurant is credited with inventing the \"white clam pie\", a pizza of crust, olive oil, oregano, grated cheese, chopped garlic, and fresh littleneck clams. It served littleneck clams on the half shell at the bar, which Pepe later added to the pizza. \nWhat makes New Haven-style pizza distinct is its thin, oblong crust, characteristic charring, chewy texture, and limited use of melting cheeses. It tends to be drier and thinner than, but closely related to, traditional New York-style pizza. Both styles in turn are close descendants of the original Neapolitan pizza.\nNew Haven-style pizza is traditionally baked in a coal-fired oven at extremely hot temperatures above 650\u00a0\u00b0F (343\u00a0\u00b0C). It is sold whole rather than by the slice.\nAlthough most commonly available locally, New Haven-style pizza has begun to spread to other parts of the United States. It has been available in the Italian-American areas of Bridgeport, and other shoreline communities for many years; Frank Pepe\u2019s also has a location in Yonkers in the Italian-heavy New York City metro area. New Haven-style has penetrated areas typically not known for large Italian-American populations, including towns in northern and central Connecticut, as well as other cities across the United States. Jimmy Fantin, a New Haven native, of Fantini's New Haven Style Apizza located in Stuart, Florida has been given great acclaim for bringing New Haven Style Apizza to South Florida with a circa 1980 Wooster Street Style experience reminiscent of his days working at Frank Pepes.\nZaretsky, Mark (December 6, 2014). \"Zuppardi's Apizza in West Haven celebrates 80 years\".

Yemenite Jews traditionally made their kubaneh from either sorghum flour or cornmeal during the regular weekdays, but made use of wheat flour on Sabbath days and holidays. \nSome would add to the dough either sugar, honey or black cumin. Baking was done in a greased pot, tightly sealed, and left to cook overnight. The kub\u0101neh was eaten the following day while it was still hot, and many of the diners have been known to ask for the qa\u02bbeh \u2013 the hard and oily lower crust, known for its delicate taste. During the winter months, some were known to insert in the kub\u0101neh the fatty-tail of sheep, or some other piece of meat, which was baked overnight along with the dough, and have thereby turned the kub\u0101neh into an unforgettable delicacy; women after childbirth might be served such a kub\u0101neh.\nKubaneh is baked by Yemenite Jews overnight and eaten for breakfast or brunch on Shabbat, and has become more broadly popular also. It is prepared baked at a low temperature in a tightly covered container. Ingredients include flour, sugar, salt, and butter (or margarine). Eggs in their shell can be cooked in the dish alongside the bread and served as an accompaniment. The bread is sometimes sprinkled with sugar, served with grated tomatoes, or served with zhug, clarified butter, and hot pepper-garlic chutney.\nKubaneh was featured in the popular Israeli television series, The Beauty and the Baker, as the lead character Amos Dahari, played by Aviv Alush (who himself is of Yemenite and Tunisian Jewish descent) is from a Yemenite Jewish family.\nJachnun\nMalawach\nMouna- a similar bread prepared by Algerian Jews\nRussian Mennonite zwieback\nMonkey bread\nRachel Yedid & Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), Ascending the Palm Tree \u2013 An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage, E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 134 ISBN\u00a0978-965-7121-33-7\nAvshalom Mizrachi, The Yemenite Cuisine, first published in Bat-Teman (Heb. \"Daughter of Yemen\"), edited by Shalom Seri, Tel-Aviv 1993, pp. 97\u201398 (Hebrew)\nYosef Qafih, Jewish Life in Sana, Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1982, p. 210\nMarks, Gil (2010).

The English language borrows the word from Levantine and Egyptian Arabic, and widely transliterates it as kanafeh, kenafeh, knafeh, kunafah, kunafeh, konafa, kunafa, and similar variations. Its form in Arabic, \u0643\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0629, renders as kn\u0101fa when transliterated.\nThe ultimate origin of kanafeh is debated. Some sources state that it comes from the Coptic Egyptian word kenephiten, meaning a bread or cake. Early attestations are found in Egyptian stories in Alf layla\u1e97 wa-layla\u1e97, the One Thousand and One Nights. Another view is that it comes from a Semitic root with a meaning of \"side\" or \"wing\", from the Arabic kanafa, \"to flank or enclose\".\nAccording to etymologist Sevan Ni\u015fanyan, the Turkish term tel kaday\u0131f\u0131 (\"string-pancake\" or \"string-cr\u00eape\"), referring to the vermicelli-like pastry often used in kanafeh and other dishes, is based on the Arabic word qatayif (a pancake or cr\u00eape). It appears in 1501 in a Turkish-Persian dictionary.\nA common story is that the dish was created, and prescribed by doctors, to satisfy the hunger of caliphs during Ramadan. The story is variously said to have happened in Fatimid Egypt, or in the Umayyad Caliphate in Syria. It is also reported to have been mentioned in writing as early as the 10th century, and to be of Fatimid origin. However, dishes mentioned in historical texts are not necessarily the same as the modern versions of kanafeh.\nIbn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th century Kitab al-Tabikh (Book of Dishes), a collection of Arabic and Persian recipes and food advice of the Abbasid caliphs, mentions neither the word kun\u0101fa, nor a description of the dish as it is known today. However, it does feature a chapter on desserts made with the related qat\u0101yif, meaning cr\u00eapes, from which the Turkish word kaday\u0131f and Greek word kata\u00effi derive. In one recipe, qat\u0101yif are stuffed with nuts, deep-fried, and topped with honey-sugar syrup, which is essentially unchanged in today's version. Also described are large thin cr\u00eapes resembling fabric, called ruq\u0101q, cooked on a round sheet of metal called a t\u0101baq, layered with fruit, and drenched with sugar.\nThe 13th century anonymous Kitab al tabikh fi-l-Maghrib wa-l-Andalus (Book of Dishes from Mahgreb and Al-Andalus) uses the word 'kun\u0101fa' to describe a cr\u00eape made with thin batter on an Indian pan or \"mirror\" (the t\u0101baq), and says it is equivalent to ruq\u0101q. It also gives a recipe for Abbasid Qat\u0101yif (the cr\u00eapes being called musahhada in Al-Andalus), which uses the same batter, but the kun\u0101fa is made thinner, \"like a fine tissue\". It gives a number of dessert recipes for kun\u0101fa, where the cr\u00eapes are served layered with fresh cheese, baked, and topped with honey and rose syrup; or cut up into shreds like rose leaves and cooked with honey, nuts, sugar, and rosewater.\nIbn al-Jazari gives an account of a 13th-century market inspector who rode through Damascus at night, ensuring the quality of kun\u0101fa, qat\u0101'if, and other foods associated with Ramadan, during the Mamluk period.\nIn the later Middle Ages, a new technique was created, with thin batter being dripped onto the metal sheet from a perforated container, creating hair-like strings. A mid-15th century Ottoman Turkish translation of Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi's Kitab al-Tabikh added several new contemporary recipes, including one for this kadayif, though it does not specify where it originated. This became the basis for the modern kunafa/kanafeh. It is fried together with butter and fillings or toppings such as nuts, sweetened cheese, or clotted cream, and mixed with rosewater and sugar. The pastry spread from the Arab lands to neighboring countries including Iran and Greece, and to Turkey where the string pastry itself is known as tel kaday\u0131f (\"string cr\u00eapes\"), also used in related pastries such as dolma kadayif.\nThere are many types of kanafeh pastry:\nkhishnah (Arabic: \u062e\u0634\u0646\u0629\u200e, rough): crust made from long thin noodle threads.\nna'ama (Arabic: \u0646\u0627\u0639\u0645\u0629\u200e, fine): semolina dough.\nmhayara (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u064a\u0631\u0629\u200e, mixed): a mixture of khishnah and na'ama.\nmbrwma  (Arabic: \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0648\u0645\u0629\u200e, twined): It is prepared with noodle.\nThe pastry is heated in butter, margarine, palm oil, or traditionally semneh and then spread with soft white cheese, such as Nabulsi cheese, and topped with more pastry. In  khishnah kanafeh the cheese is rolled in the pastry. A thick syrup of sugar, water, and a few drops of rose water or orange blossom water is poured on the pastry during the final minutes of cooking. Often the top layer of pastry is tinted with red food coloring (a modern shortcut, instead of baking it for long periods of time). Crushed pistachios are sprinkled on top as a",

Tangyuan (traditional Chinese: \u6e6f\u5713; simplified Chinese: \u6c64\u5706; pinyin: t\u0101ngyu\u00e1n; lit. 'soup ball')  is a Chinese dessert consisting of balls of glutinous rice flour and water that are deep-fried or boiled and served in a hot broth or syrup. Tangyuan can be either small or large and filled or unfilled. They are traditionally eaten during the Lantern Festival, but because the name of the dish is a homophone for union (traditional Chinese: \u5718\u5713; simplified Chinese: \u56e2\u5706; pinyin: tu\u00e1nyu\u00e1n) they are also served on wedding days, at family reunions, and during the D\u014dngzh\u00ec (winter solstice) festival.\nThe food has had several names. During the Yongle era of the Ming Dynasty, it was called yuanxiao (derived from the Yuanxiao Festival) in northern China. This name means \"first evening\", as the festival takes place in the first full moon after the Chinese New Year, which is always a new moon.\nPeople in southern China called the food tangyuan or tangtuan. In the Hakka and Cantonese varieties of Chinese, tangyuan is pronounced as \"tong rhen\" or \"tong jyun\". The term tangtuan (Hakka: tong ton, Cantonese: tong tun) is not commonly used.  Legend has it that during Yuan Shikai's rule from 1912 to 1916, he disliked the name yuanxiao (Chinese: \u5143\u5bb5) because it sounded identical to \"remove Yuan\" (Chinese: \u8881\u6d88); thus he gave orders to change the name to tangyuan. This new moniker literally means \"round balls in soup\" or \"round dumplings in soup\". Nowadays however, \"tangyuan\" usually refers to the southern style, while \"yuanxiao\" refers to the northern style, differentiated by their method of preparation.\nThis type of glutinous rice flour dumpling is eaten in both northern and southern China. Sweet fillings such as sugar, sesame, osmanthus flowers, sweet bean paste and sweetened tangerine peel are used.\nIn northern China, \"yuanxiao\" is made by rolling small pieces of hardened filling in dry glutinous rice flour, adding water slowly, until it becomes a ball with a diameter of roughly 2 centimeters, whereas the southern \"tangyuan\", is made by wrapping soft filling in a glutinous rice \"dough\" similar to making a dumpling.\nIn the South, it is common to have tang yuan plain in a savory soup made with Chinese (daikon) radish and home made fish cake.\nFor many Chinese families in mainland China as well as overseas, tangyuan is typically eaten together with family. The round shape of the balls and the bowls in which they are served symbolize family cohesion.\nTangyuan are first cooked in boiling water. Once cooked, the savory tangyuan are served in a clear soup broth, while sweet tangyuan are served in a ginger-infused syrup. Nowadays, deep-fried tangyuan have gained popularity in the Southern part of China. Filled tangyuan are put into hot oil to make its surface crispy (this is for deep-fried tangyuan).\nUnfilled tangyuan are served as part of a sweet dessert soup known in Cantonese cuisine as tong sui (literally:\"sugar water\"). Common types include:\nRed bean soup\nBlack sesame soup\nGinger and rock sugar\nFermented glutinous rice (Chinese: \u91aa\u7cdf or \u9152\u91c0), Sweet Osmanthus and rock sugar.\nThe most renowned varieties come from Ningbo in Zhejiang Province. However, they are traditionally eaten throughout China.\nTangyuan has also come to be associated with the Winter Solstice and Chinese New Year in various regions. Today, the food is eaten all year round. Mass-produced tangyuan is commonly found in the frozen food section of Asian supermarkets in China and overseas.\nIn Indonesia, an adapted version, called Wedang Ronde (Wedang in Javanese means beverage, and Ronde means round ball), is a popular food eaten during cold temperatures. The round colored balls of glutinous rice can be filled with crushed peanuts and sugar, or left plain and is served in a sweetened, mild ginger broth often boiled in fragrant pandan leaves. Crushed, toasted peanuts, tapioca pearls, and slices of coconut can also be added.\nIn Myanmar (Burma), mont lone yay baw (\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u101c\u102f\u1036\u1038\u101b\u1031\u1015\u1031\u102b\u103a) is a traditional festive dish, served during Thingyan, and filled with pieces of jaggery and served with coconut shavings.\nIn the Philippines, ginataang bilo-bil\u00f2 is also served in coconut milk, and sometimes local produce such as plantains (sab\u00e0), tapioca, and/or sweet potatoes are also added in. The traditional chinese tangyuan though is usually called in Hokkien by Chinese Filipinos as \"chi\u014dng-u\u00e2n-\u00ee\u207f\" (Chinese: \u72c0\u5143\u5713; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: chi\u014dng-go\u00e2n-\u00ee\u207f) or \"si\u014dng-gu\u00e2n-\u00ee\u207f\" (Chinese: \u4e0a\u5143\u5713; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: si\u014dng-go\u00e2n-\u00ee\u207f).\nIn Thailand, bua loi (\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e27\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e22) is a sweet glutinous rice flour",

Oatmeal and treacle are generally considered distinctive features of Lancashire parkin, whilst Yorkshire Parkin is baked using golden syrup, treacle and soft brown sugar. The flour used in parkin in England is self-raising, containing a small amount of chemical leavening agent. If this is not available, or if the proportion of oatmeal is high, it is essential to add a leavening agent, e.g. baking powder or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar.

Parkin is a gingerbread cake traditionally made with oatmeal and black treacle, which originated in northern England. Often associated with Yorkshire.  it is very widespread and popular elsewhere, notably in Lancashire. Parkin is baked to a hard cake but with resting becomes moist and even sometimes sticky. In Hull and East Yorkshire, it has a drier, more biscuit-like texture than in other areas. Parkin is traditionally eaten on Guy Fawkes Night, 5 November,  but is also enjoyed throughout the winter months. It is baked commercially throughout Yorkshire, but is mainly a domestic product in other areas.\nThe origin of the word parkin is unknown. The first published dated reference to parkin was collected from 1728 from the West Yorkshire Quarter Sessions when Anne Whittaker was accused of stealing oatmeal to make parkin. The Lancashire schoolmaster and poet Tim Bobbin describes tharf cake in 1740, and this is recognisable as a parkin. A possible older use of parkin is in the seventeenth century ballad  'The song of Arthur O'Bradley'  that purports to describe a merry wedding from the time of Robin Hood (fourteenth century)\nWhen Arthur, to make their hearts merry\n\nBrought ales and parkin and perry.\nThe tharf cake is of ancient Teutonic origin, as tharf or theorf meant 'unleavened, un-fermented, solid tough or sodden' in Old English. John Wycliffe in his translation of the Bible in 1389 (Mark Ch.14.v. 1) calls unleavened bread a \"tharf loove\"\nParkin is virtually unknown in the south of England. It is eaten in an area where oats were the staple grain for the poor, rather than wheat. It is closely related to tharf cake \u2013 an unsweetened cake cooked on a griddle rather than baked. The traditional time of the year for tharf cakes to be made  was directly after the oat harvest in the first week in November. For festive occasions, the cake would be sweetened with honey. In the seventeenth century (about 1650) sugar started to be imported from Barbados, and molasses was a by-product of the refining process. Molasses was first used by apothecaries; to make a medicine theriaca, from which name the word treacle is derived. As molasses became plentiful, or treacle as it became called at that time, it was substituted for honey in the preparation of tharf cakes.\nIn Northern Europe honey was used as a medicine, for festive cakes and making mead; before 1750 sweetness was not a characteristic of everyday food. Honey cakes had a special festive significance. They were baked to be hard, but after storage for a couple of weeks they regained their moisture becoming soft and even sticky. Molasses has hygroscopic properties. German Lebkuchen and Pfefferkuchen were other examples of hygroscopic holiday ginger-breads. They too were baked hard in summer and allowed to moisten for consumption at Christmas.\nThough parkin and tharf cake appear to be synonymous, all parkins generally were sweet tharf cakes.\nParkin and tharf cake were used interchangeably in Lancashire and South Yorkshire until 1900. Over the 500 years the recipe and taste of these cakes have changed considerably.  It was the food of the poor. Ovens were rare in the houses of the poor, and they generally had no access to public bakers before the 1820s, so the cakes were cooked on griddles or bakestones on an open fire. The best parkin was made with fresh oatmeal, which fixes the date around the first week in November.\nIn southern Lancashire and West Yorkshire, parkin is inextricably linked to the Guy Fawkes Night celebration. Jennifer Stead, in her study Prodigal Frugality, identifies the link between Guy Fawkes and parkin as the bonfire. The first two weeks in November had many Christian festivals, and like Celtic festivals that preceded them they were celebrated with a fire and ritual cakes. November starts with All Hallows Eve, that runs into All Saints Day (1 November), which is followed by All Souls Day (2 November).  Little Lent and the forty-day fast until Christmas, started at Martinmas. (11 November). On All Souls Day soul cakes were baked. The Martinmas fair was important being the traditional day when cattle were bought and sold, and servants were hired for the following year. It was also the date that cattle were slaughtered and salted to preserve them for the winter and for general feasting and dancing.\nThe Celtic festival of Samain, the festival of the dead on 1 November, was celebrated with special cakes and bonfires. It was Christianised into All Hallows by the church in 837 A.D., and the culinary tradition continued. When Guy Fawkes in 1605 gave the English church a reason to celebrate with a bonfire, the tradition was adopted under the new name, just four days later on 5 November.

Tangyuan (traditional Chinese: \u6e6f\u5713; simplified Chinese: \u6c64\u5706; pinyin: t\u0101ngyu\u00e1n; lit. 'soup ball')  is a Chinese dessert consisting of balls of glutinous rice flour and water that are deep-fried or boiled and served in a hot broth or syrup. Tangyuan can be either small or large and filled or unfilled. They are traditionally eaten during the Lantern Festival, but because the name of the dish is a homophone for union (traditional Chinese: \u5718\u5713; simplified Chinese: \u56e2\u5706; pinyin: tu\u00e1nyu\u00e1n) they are also served on wedding days, at family reunions, and during the D\u014dngzh\u00ec (winter solstice) festival.\nThe food has had several names. During the Yongle era of the Ming Dynasty, it was called yuanxiao (derived from the Yuanxiao Festival) in northern China. This name means \"first evening\", as the festival takes place in the first full moon after the Chinese New Year, which is always a new moon.\nPeople in southern China called the food tangyuan or tangtuan. In the Hakka and Cantonese varieties of Chinese, tangyuan is pronounced as \"tong rhen\" or \"tong jyun\". The term tangtuan (Hakka: tong ton, Cantonese: tong tun) is not commonly used.  Legend has it that during Yuan Shikai's rule from 1912 to 1916, he disliked the name yuanxiao (Chinese: \u5143\u5bb5) because it sounded identical to \"remove Yuan\" (Chinese: \u8881\u6d88); thus he gave orders to change the name to tangyuan. This new moniker literally means \"round balls in soup\" or \"round dumplings in soup\". Nowadays however, \"tangyuan\" usually refers to the southern style, while \"yuanxiao\" refers to the northern style, differentiated by their method of preparation.\nThis type of glutinous rice flour dumpling is eaten in both northern and southern China. Sweet fillings such as sugar, sesame, osmanthus flowers, sweet bean paste and sweetened tangerine peel are used.\nIn northern China, \"yuanxiao\" is made by rolling small pieces of hardened filling in dry glutinous rice flour, adding water slowly, until it becomes a ball with a diameter of roughly 2 centimeters, whereas the southern \"tangyuan\", is made by wrapping soft filling in a glutinous rice \"dough\" similar to making a dumpling.\nIn the South, it is common to have tang yuan plain in a savory soup made with Chinese (daikon) radish and home made fish cake.\nFor many Chinese families in mainland China as well as overseas, tangyuan is typically eaten together with family. The round shape of the balls and the bowls in which they are served symbolize family cohesion.\nTangyuan are first cooked in boiling water. Once cooked, the savory tangyuan are served in a clear soup broth, while sweet tangyuan are served in a ginger-infused syrup. Nowadays, deep-fried tangyuan have gained popularity in the Southern part of China. Filled tangyuan are put into hot oil to make its surface crispy (this is for deep-fried tangyuan).\nUnfilled tangyuan are served as part of a sweet dessert soup known in Cantonese cuisine as tong sui (literally:\"sugar water\"). Common types include:\nRed bean soup\nBlack sesame soup\nGinger and rock sugar\nFermented glutinous rice (Chinese: \u91aa\u7cdf or \u9152\u91c0), Sweet Osmanthus and rock sugar.\nThe most renowned varieties come from Ningbo in Zhejiang Province. However, they are traditionally eaten throughout China.\nTangyuan has also come to be associated with the Winter Solstice and Chinese New Year in various regions. Today, the food is eaten all year round. Mass-produced tangyuan is commonly found in the frozen food section of Asian supermarkets in China and overseas.\nIn Indonesia, an adapted version, called Wedang Ronde (Wedang in Javanese means beverage, and Ronde means round ball), is a popular food eaten during cold temperatures. The round colored balls of glutinous rice can be filled with crushed peanuts and sugar, or left plain and is served in a sweetened, mild ginger broth often boiled in fragrant pandan leaves. Crushed, toasted peanuts, tapioca pearls, and slices of coconut can also be added.\nIn Myanmar (Burma), mont lone yay baw (\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u101c\u102f\u1036\u1038\u101b\u1031\u1015\u1031\u102b\u103a) is a traditional festive dish, served during Thingyan, and filled with pieces of jaggery and served with coconut shavings.\nIn the Philippines, ginataang bilo-bil\u00f2 is also served in coconut milk, and sometimes local produce such as plantains (sab\u00e0), tapioca, and/or sweet potatoes are also added in.

Sup kambing or sop kambing is a Southeast Asian mutton soup, commonly found in Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore. It is prepared with goat meat, tomato, celery, spring onion, ginger, candlenut and lime leaf, its broth is yellowish in colour. Sup kambing is quite widespread as numbers of similar goat meat soup recipes can be found throughout Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. \nIn Indonesia, it is mostly associated with Malay of Medan, Betawi and Madurese cuisine, although it is also common in Java. Nevertheless, Javanese are more likely to cook their goat meat as tongseng or Javanese-style soupy gulai instead. Traditionally, sup kambing together with gulai and sate kambing are quite widespread during Eid al-Adha, as large amount of goat meat and offals being distributed among people.\nIn Malaysia, sup kambing is also associated with the Muslim Malaysian Indian community and believed to be of Indian origin. In Singapore, the dish is also associated with the Muslim Indian community of the island.\nDespite its wide popularity in Maritime Southeast Asia, the question of origin however, might be owed to the Arabs and Muslim Indian migrations into the region. Sup kambing is believed to be of Arab origin, brought by the influx of Arabs migrants into the Malay Archipelago between the 18th to 19th century, during colonial era. The Arabs settlers introduced and promoted goat, lamb and mutton as their preferred meat, thus several dishes influenced by Arab and Muslim Indian culinary traditions were introduced to Sumatra, Malay peninsula and Java. Around the same period, other mutton or goat-based dishes such as sate kambing, gulai kambing and tongseng also appeared in Java.\nThe early Arab immigrants settled in coastal towns of Sumatra and Java, and subsequently influenced the culture of native ethnic groups including Malays, the Betawis of Batavia (Jakarta), also Javanese and Madurese of East Java. The sup kambing was adopted by locals, and often linked to the Islamic festival of kurban (Eid al-Adha), where large numbers of cattle \u2013 including goats, are slaughtered and distributed among people. As the result, despite its Arab origin, today in Indonesia sup kambing is more associated with Malay, Madurese, and Betawi cuisine. Indonesian sup kambing uses carrot, tomato, and sometimes potato, which hints its European (possibly Portuguese or Dutch) influences. Tomato and potato are not available in Southeast Asia until European colonials brought them from the Americas around the 17th century. The sup kambing from Medan in North Sumatra however, is closer to the Malaysian version, since they commonly derived from Muslim Indian culture.\nIn Malay Peninsula region, which today includes Malaysia and Singapore, the most popular version is sup kambing Mamak which is believed to have been invented by the Muslim Indian community there, where the use of typical spices is quite notable. There is no exact equivalent of this soup in Indian sub-continent, although the spices used and the style of cooking clearly demonstrates Indian influence. The most famous sup kambing in Singapore is the sup tulang merah which was invented by Baharudeen, Abdul Hameed (mammaka) and Abdul Kadir who were migrants from a remote village Thopputhurai in Tamilnadu. These three shops are located at Jalan Sultan, Beach Road. The dish is also adopted by native Malays in both countries.\nIn Indonesia the soup is prepared in rich savoury broth with spices and ingredients similar to other Indonesian favourite, sop buntut (oxtail soup). Common sop kambing uses goat meat, also its ribs; however, in Indonesia there is a more specific sop kambing called sop kepala kambing which uses offals of goat's head, which includes its tongue, ear, lips and cheek meats, eyes and sometimes brain. Another specific sup kambing is called sop kaki kambing which uses goat's trotters.\nList of Indonesian soups\nMamak stall\nVarious Indonesian Sup Kambing recipes (in Indonesian)\nJakarta-Style Goat Feet Soup from Indonesia Eats\n\"40 of Indonesia's best dishes\".

In the Vietnamese language, b\u00e1nh means \"cake\", and b\u00f2 can either mean \"cow\" or \"to crawl\". According to Paulus Hu\u1ef3nh T\u1ecbnh C\u1ee7a's 1895 dictionary \u0110\u1ea1i Nam qu\u1ed1c \u00e2m t\u1ef1 v\u1ecb, the dessert is named for its resemblance to a cow's udder, implying that the name was shortened from b\u00e1nh v\u00fa b\u00f2. However, according to a popular folk etymology, b\u00f2 refers to how the cake \"crawls\" up to the rim of the bowl when steamed to completion.\nB\u00e1nh b\u00f2 is to be distinguished from the less common b\u00e1nh b\u00f3 (\"pressed cake\"), a fruit cake found in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province; b\u00f2 (\"cow\", \"beef\") is pronounced with a falling tone, whereas b\u00f3 (\"pressed\") has a rising tone.\nThere are varieties of b\u00e1nh b\u00f2:\nB\u00e1nh b\u00f2 n\u01b0\u1edbng (lit.\u2009'baked b\u00e1nh b\u00f2') - This variety of b\u00e1nh b\u00f2 is cooked by baking in a pan in an oven. It is generally off-white or yellowish-white in color on the inside and golden on the outside by caramelized coconut milk. Individual cakes are often large in size, in which case a serving will consist of a slice rather than the whole cake. This variety is definitely served alone.\nB\u00e1nh b\u00f2 h\u1ea5p (lit.\u2009'steamed b\u00e1nh b\u00f2') is similar in appearance to the baked version. These cakes are often small in size, ball-shaped and cooked from the liquid. B\u00e1nh b\u00f2 h\u1ea5p may be white in color, green (by Pandanus amaryllifolius extract), pink or pale purple (by magenta plant extract). There are three ways to serve this variety. Like b\u00e1nh b\u00f2 n\u01b0\u1edbng, it can be used alone. It can be put in the middle of b\u00e1nh ti\u00eau (Chinese hollow doughnuts) and served. Also, people enjoy them in a small dish with coconut milk sauce including tapioca starch on top and a little bit mu\u1ed1i m\u00e8 or mu\u1ed1i \u0111\u1eadu ph\u1ed9ng (literally: sesame salt and peanut salt, respectively).\nBoth traditional varieties are available in Vietnam as well as in Asian grocery stores in countries with substantial overseas Vietnamese populations, such as the United States and France.\nB\u00e1nh b\u00f2 s\u1eefa (n\u01b0\u1edbng) (lit.\u2009'(baked) milk b\u00e1nh b\u00f2') is a brand new variety of b\u00e1nh b\u00f2 appearing in the mid-2000s. Coconut milk, the official traditional ingredient is replaced by condensed milk or milk powder. The variety is cooked in a small pan.\nB\u00e1nh b\u00f2 d\u1eeba (lit.\u2009'coconut b\u00e1nh b\u00f2') is the latest variety of b\u00e1nh b\u00f2 appearing in the late 2000s. It is not generally recognized because it seems totally different from three above mainly from core ingredients. Core ingredients are wheat powder, hen eggs, baking soda, and obviously sweetened coconut. It tastes much leathery, seldom hard crispy and silky in the skin as opposed three above. In the middle, there is sweetened coconut with cooked mung bean.\nThe Indian steamed rice cake called idli is similar in texture, although idli are never sweet. However, the dish is quite similar to the Vattayappam (a type of appam from Kerala, India).\nWhite sugar sponge cake\nIdli\nBika ambon\nThanh Nien Weekly print edition August 26, 2011 Rural cakes awaken the child within \"B\u00e1nh b\u00f2 (literally \"cow cake\") is a sweet and chewy sponge cake.

Some variants of b\u00e1nh t\u1ebb include peanuts and chopped shiitake mushrooms.\nIn order to make b\u00e1nh t\u1ebb, rice is first soaked in water until it is soft enough, then it is ground by hand with a grindstone to turn rice into a thick or watery mixture of water and rice powder. This mixture is cooked to a temperature above 50 degrees Celsius (but not to boiling) while it is stirred for 3 hours until it reaches the consistency of thick slurry.\nFor the filling, pork, onion, and shiitake mushrooms are finely minced and combined.\nTo compose the dish, a layer of rice paste is layered onto a leaf, followed by a layer of filling, and then another layer of rice paste. The final b\u00e1nh is then wrapped with the leaves tied with thread or string, forming slender cylinder. The last step involves steaming the b\u00e1nh t\u1ebb for 20 minutes until fully cooked.\nB\u00e1nh t\u1ebb are served with n\u01b0\u1edbc m\u1eafm (fish sauce) and sprinkled with black pepper.

The traditional Hawaiian recipe for haupia calls for heated coconut milk to be mixed with ground pia (Polynesian arrowroot, Tacca leontopetaloides) until the mixture thickens. Due to the lack of availability of arrowroot starch, some modern recipes for haupia substitute cornstarch.\nHaupia is very similar to the European dessert blancmange.\nIn the typical modern recipe, diluted coconut milk, sugar, and salt is mixed with arrowroot or cornstarch and heated until thickened and smooth, then poured into a rectangular pan and chilled as with gelatin. It is traditionally cut into small blocks and served on squares of ti leaf or plain.\nA popular variation is haupia pie, where the haupia is set in a crust as one layer, then is usually accompanied with another layer of either chocolate or purple sweet potato. \nSome recipes for coconut desserts actually call for unflavored gelatin in place of the cornstarch, but it would be erroneous to call them haupia. Many local confections that contain coconut or coconut flavoring are advertised as haupia flavored.

Roti bakar was developed during the era of Dutch colonial rule as a practical way to consume day-old bread; it was typically served with butter, condensed milk, or Dutch cheeses. After Indonesian independence, roti bakar became ubiquitous throughout Indonesia, as consumption of toast became a matter of taste for its people as opposed to the practicality of avoiding the wastage of stale bread. \nMany flavor variants have been developed for modern tastes, such as hagelslag, crushed Oreo biscuits, or chocolate syrup.\nIn Malaysia, kaya and cold butter are a popular combination to spread on roti bakar. The city of Ipoh in Perak is known for its kopitiam establishments, where roti bakar accompanied with local tea or coffee beverages and a serving of half boiled eggs is a staple order during morning or afternoon tea. \nA variation on roti bakar is roti titab, a thick warm toast with kaya spread onto all four corners and topped with a half-boiled egg.\nKaya toast\nLatip, Khalid (March 30, 2021). \"Kopi giling dan roti bakar kayu arang tarikan ke Sarikei\".

Troccoli is a spaghetti-like pasta which is traditionally processed by the so-called troccolaturo or troccolo, a grooved rolling pin which cuts the dough into regular strips about 3\u20135\u00a0mm (0.12\u20130.20\u00a0in) thick; as a result of the pressure employed on the dough, the cross section of each strip will be either square or slightly oval, according to the shape of the grooves themselves (which can be either flat or pointy).\nAs for its ingredients, troccoli is basically made with durum wheat flour and water, with the optional addition of a few eggs - that is why it is sometimes associated with tagliolini and egg pasta as a whole.\nThe troccolaturo or troccolo is an old kitchen utensil in use for several centuries in Italy. In his Opera dell'arte del cucinare, published in 1570, Bartolomeo Scappi mentions this tool under the name of ferro da maccheroni (\"macaroni iron\") and shows an engraving that clearly lends us an idea of what this kitchenware looked like in ancient times. It was basically a grooved rolling pin made of metal, though the metal was gradually replaced by hardwoods and today this tool comes in both materials, especially in beech wood or bronze.\nAs for the etymology of nouns like troccolo or troccolaturo, they originate from Latin torculum (Standard Italian torchio or, in times past, torcolo), which ultimately comes from the verb torquere (\"to press\") and refers to the press in the context of food processing: in this case, the press is manual rather than mechanical and is basically a rudimentary utensil to process food, especially suitable for homemade pasta. Troccoli itself is likely named after this kitchenware, though it might as well have a separate origin and refer to Latin torculum as the product of this food processing method, namely a pasta chip or truciolo di pasta in Italian: in this case, troccolo (here intended as singular for troccoli) would be a dialect variation of truciolo, as these words are actually cognates (i.e. they both originate from  torculum).\nBigoli\nPici\nSpaghetti alla chitarra\nIn times past, maccheroni used to be a generic term for several kinds of pasta, including spaghetti. Some regional expressions still keep this old meaning alive, as is the case with maccheroni alla chitarra (a synonym of spaghetti alla chitarra), maccheroncini alla Campofilone, maccaronara, etc.\nAs is the case with food extrusion, a troccolaturo made of bronze produces a rougher surface on the dough: this is considered to give troccoli an improved taste, as a rough surface better retains pasta sauces.\nBoth troccolo and troccolaturo are dialect terms rather than Standard Italian nouns (troccolaturo is simply an agent noun, cognate of Italian torchiatore).\nThe Latin noun torculum has indeed originated two separate meanings: one referring to the subject executing the action (i.e. the press or torchio in Italian); the other one referring to the object undergoing the same action (i.e. the chip or truciolo that is \"chipped off\" by the pressure, so to speak).\nPetroni, Paolo (2011).

It is rice mixed with minced pork and pork blood, flavored with salt, sugar, a little of garlic, shallot, vegetable oil, and then steamed inside a banana leaf. It is commonly served with fried chopped garlic, fried dried bird chilies, and cucumber.\nIn Northern Thailand, the word kan means 'squeeze' and chin means 'meat'. It is believed to be an origin of a dish name according to the cooking method.\nKhao kan chin was originally a dish from Tai Yai ethnic before widespread to Lanna Kingdom or the Northern Thailand of Thailand. It is sometimes called khao ngiao because in ancient time, Lanna ethnic used to call them \"Ngiao\" which implied to racism, in terms of insincere and tricky people. Therefore, Tai Yai cultures in the Northern Thailand of Thailand compose of the word ngiao in the end of their names. Tai Yai was the only ethnic that consumed rice, apart from other ethnics who preferred sticky rice for the main course. This has made Khao kan chin become one of hardly found Lanna dishes that made with rice.\nIt can be served with fried chopped garlic, fried chopped shallot, fried dried bird chilies, onions, and cucumber. Also, it can be served as a side dish of nam ngiao.\n\"Khao Kanchin\". Lanna Food. Chiang Mai University.\n\"\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e04\u0e33\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\".

Pasta e fagioli ([\u02c8pasta e ffa\u02c8d\u0292\u0254\u02d0li]), meaning \"pasta and beans\", is a traditional Italian pasta dish. It is often called pasta fasul or pasta fazool in the New York Italian dialect, derived from its Neapolitan name, pasta e fasule.\nLike many other Italian favorites, including pizza and polenta, it started as a peasant dish, being composed of inexpensive ingredients.\nThe recipe varies greatly based on the region or town in which it is prepared, depending on available ingredients. The consistency of the dish can vary, with some being soupy, while others are much thicker. For instance, in Bari the dish is thicker in consistency and uses mixed pasta shapes. It also uses pancetta in the base of the sauce. Other varieties call for the beans to be passed through a food mill, giving it a stew-like consistency. Pasta e ceci, a version replacing the beans with chickpeas, is common in Rome.\nThe word for \"beans\" varies in different languages of Italy, e.g. fagioli [fa\u02c8d\u0292\u0254\u02d0li] in standard Italian, fasule [fa\u02c8su\u02d0l\u0259] in Neapolitan, and fasola [fa\u02c8s\u0254\u02d0la] in Sicilian.\n\"Pastafazoola\", a 1927 novelty song by Van and Schenck, capitalizes on the Neapolitan pronunciation in the rhyme, \"Don't be a fool, eat pasta fazool.\" The song \"That's Amore\", by Warren and Brooks (popularized by Dean Martin), includes the rhyme \"When the stars make you drool, just like pasta fazool, that's amore\".\nMinestrone\nList of Italian dishes\nList of legume dishes\nList of pasta dishes\n\u00a0Food portal\nTony, Morinelli. \"Pasta e Fagioli (Pasta Fasul)\".

If we drop snails into a basin full of water, dead snails will rotate the bottom up, picking them up, they will be light. Snail after buying is not cooked immediately. To clean snails thoroughly, you should soak them overnight in rice water, after that, rubbing snail's shell by a brush under the water flow. Or you can drop a small iron knife into a pot of water soaked in snails. The smell of iron in water will stimulate snails to release mud and dirt faster and more thoroughly. ...",

B\u00fan \u1ed1c (\"snail vermicelli soup\") is a Vietnamese dish originating from Hanoi, Vietnam. Roasted or boiled snails (\u1ed1c lu\u1ed9c), may be eaten first as an appetizer. Snail congee is called ch\u00e1o \u1ed1c, and canh \u1ed1c chu\u1ed1i \u0111\u1eadu, is a thin snail soup with green banana, fried tofu and t\u00eda t\u00f4.\nThough it isn't known when this dish was first created, it is certainly one of the most typical dishes of Vietnamese cuisine.  It's speculated to have  come from a certain countryside, then followed the footsteps of immigrants to Thang Long citadel and became a specialty there.  A related dish called luosifen (snail noodles) is popular across the border in Guangxi, China.\nThe Hanoian often choose snails which are smaller and chewier than their land-based cousins. Fat and fresh snails are preferable, with rice noodles that were not soaked in water for too long. Cooks choose the best bun (rice noodle), which means thin and clear noodles. Bun oc not only contains broth, snails, and tofu as its basic characteristics but it can also contain green bananas, some fresh vegetables or chopped water spinach, bean sprouts, water dropwort, tomatoes, and other ingredients.\n\"gi\u1ea5m b\u1ed7ng\", a Vietnamese vinegar, is added for acidity and to highlight the taste, as well as a sweeter tomato broth. The ingredients are tangled white rice vermicelli noodles (similar to regular white rice vermicelli noodles but thinner) and boiled snails. B\u00fan \u1ed1c can be served in two different ways: in its broth (called \"hot snail noodles\") or with broth in a separate bowl (called \"cold snail noodles\") with vegetables. The broth is made from stewed bones, tomatoes, and other ingredients. Cold snail noodles,  which are eaten by dipping the noodles in the broth, are a popular meal during the summer.\nShrimp paste and chili are optional, although purists like Vietnamese writer Vu Bang insist on adding those for a more piquant flavor. In Mon ngon Ha Noi by Vu Bang said \"It is a gift, which can be said to have achieved the goal of culinary art of Hanoians.\"\n\nThanh Nien Slimy scrumptious snails June 17, 2011 \"\u1ed0c lu\u1ed9c is a simple snack and can be considered the appetizer for a series of snail courses.

It is a native delicacy in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines, particularly in the area around Tacloban City in the province of Leyte and in Eastern Samar province. Other parts of the Philippines have their versions of it, however. In fact, the moron was adopted as one of Mambajao, Camiguin's locally-produced products.\nSince it is a variety of suman, the moron is cooked with glutinous rice, coconut milk and sugar. The main difference is that moron is gyrated with chocolate tablea (tablets) or mixed with cocoa powder while a regular suman is not. It also has a hint of vanilla and is usually partnered with coffee or sikwate (a native Philippine chocolate drink). With chocolate as its distinct ingredient, it is also called chocolate moron or chocolate suman.\nMoron is usually sold in bundles of four pieces that are individually wrapped in a banana leaf. Tourists from Leyte usually buy moron as a pasalubong or gift for their relatives and friends.  In the places where moron originated, it is usually served at festivals, birthday parties, and funeral wakes.  Visitors from those parties usually takes home some of the moron. The food is also a medium of exchange for goodwill in Tacloban and the nearby municipalities of Palo, Tanauan, Tolosa, Dulag, Mayorga and Abuyog.\nPhilippine government agencies usually promote and support locally produced goods such as the moron.  The Department of Science and Technology of the Philippines advocated the longer shelf life of food products including the moron to help producers of those kind of food products while the Department of Trade and Industry of the Philippines conducted trade fairs to develop and promote products, which included the moron.  The Department of Labor and Employment of the Philippines meanwhile made a project in Mambujao, Camiguin for the production of moron.\nBinagol\nMoron (psychology)\nPastrano, Mozart (February 27, 2014). \"Tacloban's 'moron' lives on\".

It is typically made with flour, eggs, sugar, a dash of salt, baking powder, vanilla, oil, milk, and cream of tartar. The resulting cake is pink to purple in color (depending on the amount of ube used) and slightly denser and moister than regular chiffon cakes.

Ube cake is a traditional Filipino chiffon cake or sponge cake made with ube halaya (mashed purple yam). It is distinctively vividly purple in color, like most dishes made with ube in the Philippines.\nLike mam\u00f3n, ube cake can be modified readily into other recipes.\nThe combination of ube and macapuno (coconut sport) is a traditional one for ube halaya in Filipino cuisine, and it also applies to ube cakes. Ube macapuno cake is basically just ube cake with strips of gelatinous macapuno strips layered on top.\nOther combinations of ube cake include ube pandan cake and ube leche flan cake, among others.\nUbe mam\u00f3n or ube cupcakes are ube cakes baked into the shape of large cupcakes, which is the traditional shape of Filipino chiffon cakes.\nUbe roll or ube pianono is a variant of ube cake made into a Swiss roll (known as pianono in the Philippines). It typically has an ube filling made with butter, sugar, milk, and mashed ube. A very similar dessert made from meringue instead of chiffon or sponge cake is brazo de ube, which is more accurately a variant of brazo de Mercedes.\nUbe taisan is a version of ube cake cooked as a traditional Filipino taisan cake. Like the taisan, it is rectangular in shape and is not frosted, but is covered with butter (or margarine), cheese, and white sugar.\nUbe cheesecake\nMango cake\nFlan cake\nBrazo de Mercedes\nCrema de fruta\nMango float\nBuko pandan cake\nUbe crinkles\nUbe ice cream\n\"Ube Cake\".

The English language borrows the word from Levantine and Egyptian Arabic, and widely transliterates it as kanafeh, kenafeh, knafeh, kunafah, kunafeh, konafa, kunafa, and similar variations. Its form in Arabic, \u0643\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0629, renders as kn\u0101fa when transliterated.\nThe ultimate origin of kanafeh is debated. Some sources state that it comes from the Coptic Egyptian word kenephiten, meaning a bread or cake. Early attestations are found in Egyptian stories in Alf layla\u1e97 wa-layla\u1e97, the One Thousand and One Nights. Another view is that it comes from a Semitic root with a meaning of \"side\" or \"wing\", from the Arabic kanafa, \"to flank or enclose\".\nAccording to etymologist Sevan Ni\u015fanyan, the Turkish term tel kaday\u0131f\u0131 (\"string-pancake\" or \"string-cr\u00eape\"), referring to the vermicelli-like pastry often used in kanafeh and other dishes, is based on the Arabic word qatayif (a pancake or cr\u00eape). It appears in 1501 in a Turkish-Persian dictionary.\nA common story is that the dish was created, and prescribed by doctors, to satisfy the hunger of caliphs during Ramadan. The story is variously said to have happened in Fatimid Egypt, or in the Umayyad Caliphate in Syria. It is also reported to have been mentioned in writing as early as the 10th century, and to be of Fatimid origin. However, dishes mentioned in historical texts are not necessarily the same as the modern versions of kanafeh.\nIbn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th century Kitab al-Tabikh (Book of Dishes), a collection of Arabic and Persian recipes and food advice of the Abbasid caliphs, mentions neither the word kun\u0101fa, nor a description of the dish as it is known today. However, it does feature a chapter on desserts made with the related qat\u0101yif, meaning cr\u00eapes, from which the Turkish word kaday\u0131f and Greek word kata\u00effi derive. In one recipe, qat\u0101yif are stuffed with nuts, deep-fried, and topped with honey-sugar syrup, which is essentially unchanged in today's version. Also described are large thin cr\u00eapes resembling fabric, called ruq\u0101q, cooked on a round sheet of metal called a t\u0101baq, layered with fruit, and drenched with sugar.\nThe 13th century anonymous Kitab al tabikh fi-l-Maghrib wa-l-Andalus (Book of Dishes from Mahgreb and Al-Andalus) uses the word 'kun\u0101fa' to describe a cr\u00eape made with thin batter on an Indian pan or \"mirror\" (the t\u0101baq), and says it is equivalent to ruq\u0101q. It also gives a recipe for Abbasid Qat\u0101yif (the cr\u00eapes being called musahhada in Al-Andalus), which uses the same batter, but the kun\u0101fa is made thinner, \"like a fine tissue\". It gives a number of dessert recipes for kun\u0101fa, where the cr\u00eapes are served layered with fresh cheese, baked, and topped with honey and rose syrup; or cut up into shreds like rose leaves and cooked with honey, nuts, sugar, and rosewater.\nIbn al-Jazari gives an account of a 13th-century market inspector who rode through Damascus at night, ensuring the quality of kun\u0101fa, qat\u0101'if, and other foods associated with Ramadan, during the Mamluk period.\nIn the later Middle Ages, a new technique was created, with thin batter being dripped onto the metal sheet from a perforated container, creating hair-like strings. A mid-15th century Ottoman Turkish translation of Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi's Kitab al-Tabikh added several new contemporary recipes, including one for this kadayif, though it does not specify where it originated. This became the basis for the modern kunafa/kanafeh. It is fried together with butter and fillings or toppings such as nuts, sweetened cheese, or clotted cream, and mixed with rosewater and sugar. The pastry spread from the Arab lands to neighboring countries including Iran and Greece, and to Turkey where the string pastry itself is known as tel kaday\u0131f (\"string cr\u00eapes\"), also used in related pastries such as dolma kadayif.\nThere are many types of kanafeh pastry:\nkhishnah (Arabic: \u062e\u0634\u0646\u0629\u200e, rough): crust made from long thin noodle threads.\nna'ama (Arabic: \u0646\u0627\u0639\u0645\u0629\u200e, fine): semolina dough.\nmhayara (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u064a\u0631\u0629\u200e, mixed): a mixture of khishnah and na'ama.\nmbrwma  (Arabic: \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0648\u0645\u0629\u200e, twined): It is prepared with noodle.\nThe pastry is heated in butter, margarine, palm oil, or traditionally semneh and then spread with soft white cheese, such as Nabulsi cheese, and topped with more pastry. In  khishnah kanafeh the cheese is rolled in the pastry. A thick syrup of sugar, water, and a few drops of rose water or orange blossom water is poured on the pastry during the final minutes of cooking. Often the top layer of pastry is tinted with red food coloring (a modern shortcut, instead of baking it for long periods of time). Crushed pistachios are sprinkled on top as a",

It is made from basic cookie ingredients of flour, sugar, egg whites and butter rolled out thinly and then shaped into a hollow cylinder or a cone. It was traditionally sold by roadside vendors known as barquilleros that carry a characteristic red roulette tin (the ruleta de barquillero). It was introduced to Latin America and the Philippines during colonial times. In Spain and former Spanish colonies, barquillos are commonly regarded as a type of Christmas cookie.

The Spanish name barquillo means \"little boat\". It is derived from the ancient tradition of heating the biscuits in convex or boat-shaped molds. Barquillos are also known by a variety of names. In English it is also known as biscuit roll, cookie roll, crispy biscuit roll, egg roll, crisp biscuit roll,  or love letter. The Chinese name for this snack, \"\u86cb\u5377\", can be directly translated into English as \"egg roll\". However, the food item known in the West as egg roll is very different.\nBarquillos are thin wafers made from flour, sugar, egg whites and butter that is rolled into the shape of a long hollow tube or a cone. They can also be sold simply folded over twice in a fan shape. \nIn Spain, it was traditionally sold by roaming roadside vendors known as \"barquilleros\" (or \"barquilleras\") during festive events. In Madrid, barquilleros are particularly associated with the fiesta of San Isidro Labrador, where the vendors typically dress in castizo (chulapo) attire. \nBarquilleros carry a characteristic red tin known as the ruleta de barquillero which has a roulette spinner at the top. Buying barquillos typically involve a small game, where the buyer pays to spin the roulette. Depending on where the ticker lands, the buyer can either have one or two barquillos for the same price. The buyer can also pay a slightly larger amount to continue spinning the roulette and getting barquillos until it lands on one of the four golden markers.\nThe tradition of barquilleros almost became extinct during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Today, barquillos are most popular in Asia which has a larger population than Spain.\nBarquillos are traditionally eaten plain. Modern versions, however, can flavor it with ingredients including vanilla, cinnamon, grated coconut, and lemon juice. Barquillos are also commonly dipped or coated in milk chocolate or have a chocolate center. Due to their similarity to ice cream cones, they are also commonly sold as containers for frozen treats.\nSimilar recipes to barquillos also exist in other countries in Europe, like the parizske pecivo of Czechoslovakia, the pirouettes of France, and krumkake of Norway. Flat versions are known as wafle in Poland, goro in Norway, and pizzelle in Italy, among others.\n\nIn Argentina and Chile, cylindrical barquillos filled with dulce de leche, chocolate, or other sweet fillings are known as cuchufl\u00eds (Chile) or cubanitos (Argentina).\nBarquillos in the Philippines lack the grid-pattern of traditional Spanish barquillos. They are thinner and are usually rolled into elongated cylindrical shapes. Philippine barquillos are most strongly associated with the city of Iloilo, particularly to the Deocampo bakery, which has been commercially mass-producing barquillos since 1896.\nA notable variant of barquillo is the Filipino barquiron (also spelled barqueron), which are barquillos filled with polvor\u00f3n and crushed peanuts, cashew nuts, or pili nuts. It originates from the city of Iloilo. Other variants of Philippine barquillos include those flavored with ube, pandan leaves, and carrots, which are bright purple, green, and orange in color, respectively.\nIn Hong Kong, biscuit rolls are made of wheat flour, butter, egg, sugar, and vanilla flavour.\n\nCucurucho\nPizzele\nWaffle\nSemprong\nFortune cookie\nKuih kapit\n\"Cookie Roll\". biscuit people.

Several times in succession, the dough is folded and rolled out thinly, and coated with butter. As soon as the dough is sufficiently outstretched to a filmy layer, it is moistened with a little water, sprinkled with a melange of sugar and cinnamon and finally rolled up. In order to provide the filled dough roll with the typical shape of a Franzbrtchen, it has to be cut into slices, each about four centimetres thick. Afterwards, the pieces are pressed together in the middle of the cut faces with the handle of a wooden spoon, which causes the filling to ooze out sideways. ...",

A Franzbr\u00f6tchen ([\u02c8f\u0281ants\u02ccb\u0281\u00f8\u02d0t\u00e7\u025bn]) is a small, sweet pastry baked with butter and cinnamon, similar to a cinnamon roll. Sometimes other ingredients are used as well, such as chocolate or raisins. It is a type of pastry commonly found in northern Germany, especially Hamburg, and it is usually served for breakfast, but is also enjoyed along with coffee and cake. As its name indicates, the Franzbr\u00f6tchen was probably inspired by French pastries. Originally, it could be found only in the region of Hamburg, but now Franzbr\u00f6tchen are also sold in Bremen, Berlin, and other German cities.\nThe Franzbr\u00f6tchen was probably named in the style of the French (German 'franz\u00f6sisch') model, the croissant, which is also made of pastry and became popular in Germany after Napoleon's troops had occupied Hamburg between 1806 and 1814. According to a different historical tradition, they produced a longish Franzbrot (German for 'French bread') which resembled the baguette. Legend has it, a baker in Hamburg had once seared such a Franzbrot in a pan of fat, which is considered the origin of the contemporary Franzbr\u00f6tchen.\nList of German desserts\nCinnamon Roll\n\"Happi, Happi - Mors, Mors\".

There is no meat consumed for three days after the death and dhansak is used to break this abstinence on the fourth day.

Limpa (swedish for Loaf)  is a sweet Scandinavian rye bread, associated with Swedish cuisine. It is a yeast-leavened spice loaf, sweetened with brown sugar and molasses which comes in a large variety in regards to whether or not butter-enriched, and which spices are being used. Traditional bread spices are anise,  caraway, fennel seeds and bitter orange.\nTypically baked during the Christmas season, the festive wort breads / loaves (Swedish: v\u00f6rtbr\u00f6d / v\u00f6rtlimpa)I are flavoured with spices like anise, caraway and fennel seeds, and often orange rinds, raisins or sultanas, and dark beer, in addition to the wort. Its distinct taste and look is in large part due to the addition of wort to the dough, making it similar to a malt loaf.  It is a typical dish for a traditional Christmas Eve sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord or julbord. Limpa bread pairs well with jams and jellies, or cream cheese.\nThe first step for making the bread is to bring molasses, brown sugar, caraway seeds, wort and water to a gentle boil, then to add shortening or butter and citrus rind. Once this mixture has cooled to a lukewarm temperature it is combined with activated yeast and rye flour. The dough rises and more flour is added to knead the dough in preparation for a second rise, then the tops are brushed with melted butter and the loaves are baked.  Some recipes add the molasses mixture to the dry ingredients after the rye flour has been scalded with hot water.\nJulekake\nList of breads\nList of Christmas dishes\nSmith, Leslie. \"Scandinavian Ideas for a South Dakota Christmas\".

Dhansak is made by cooking mutton cubes with a mixture of various lentils and vegetables. Traditionally, four lentils (arhar dal, Bengal gram or chana dal, red masoor dal and brown masoor dal) are used, but one or more of the lentils may be omitted or substituted. The vegetables include potato, tomato, brinjal, pumpkin and  fenugreek leaves: again, substitutions, such as squash for pumpkin, and sweet potato for potato, may be employed: it depends on what vegetables are conveniently at hand. After prolonged cooking in the traditional recipe (or the use of a pressure cooker), the vegetables are more or less homogenised with the lentils, which are also broken down, so that the result is a thick stew rather than a curry.\nThe recipe has evolved over time. The Parsees, who are adherents of Zoroastrianism, came to Western India as religious refugees in the 8th century CE, after the Arab conquest of Persia and the fall of the Sassanid Empire in 651 C. They brought with them the tradition of cooking meat with lentils and/or vegetables. However, tomatoes, chilies, pumpkin and potatoes are native to the Americas and were unknown in India until some time after the Portuguese (who in turn got them through trade with Spain) brought them to India in the 16th century CE. \nThe dhansak is flavoured with a spice mixture called \"dhansak masala\", which is similar to \"garam masala\" except that the spices chosen are more aromatic and sweet rather than pungent. Cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, dried ginger, coriander seed and cumin seed, as well as a pinch of asafetida, are among the spices employed.  Onion and garlic are browned to serve as the stew's base, and  coriander leaves, green chilli and mint leaves are employed as garnish. While \"dhansak masala\" is sold as a ready-made mixture, the individual cook may make the spice mixture from scratch, altering the combination and proportion of spices based on personal preference. Within the Parsi community, dhansak usually contains goat meat or mutton; it is rarely made with other meats, such as chicken, or without meat.\nInternational recipe variants for the dhansak sometimes call for pineapple chunks to provide a sweet flavour,  but traditional Indian recipes prefer the use of pumpkin, squash or gourd.\nList of lamb dishes\nList of goat dishes\nTanya M.

Dhansak is a popular Indian dish, originating among the Parsi Zoroastrian community. It combines elements of Persian and Gujarati cuisine. Dhansak is made by cooking mutton or goat meat with a mixture of lentils and vegetables. This is served with caramelised white rice, which is rice cooked in water, whole spices, and caramelized onions. The dal cooked with mutton and vegetables served with brown rice, altogether is called dhansak.\nThe technique of extending a relatively expensive ingredient (meat) by combining it with vegetables and/or lentils in the same recipe is widely employed in Persian cooking. (\"Dhan\" is Gujarati cereal dish mentioned in Kanhadade Prabandha in 1455 AD; \"Sak\" (derived from Gujarati \"shaak\" meaning vegetable greens or cooked vegetables.) The Gujarati element of the  recipe is the liberal use of a variety of Indian spices and condiments, in contrast to the more mellow Iranian recipes.\nIn Parsi homes, dhansak is traditionally made on Sundays  owing to the long preparation time required to cook the lentils and vegetables into a mush (in the days before pressure cooking was employed).\nDhansak is also always had on the fourth day after the death of a near one. There is no meat consumed for three days after the death and dhansak is used to break this abstinence on the fourth day. Hence, dhansak is never prepared on auspicious occasions like festivals and weddings.\nList of lamb dishes\nList of goat dishes\nTanya M. Luhrmann (1996).

It is a flat and dense cake made with wheat cake flour, butter, sugar, and eggs, typically near an inch tall, and dusted with powdered sugar. While sweet and rich, it is somewhat firm, and is able to be cut into pieces similarly to a brownie. Gooey butter cake is generally served as a type of coffee cake and not as a formal dessert cake. There are two distinct variants of the cake: the original St. Louis, MO Bakers' gooey butter and a cream cheese and commercial yellow cake mix variant. The original St. Louis, MO Bakers' gooey butter is believed to have originated in the 1930s. It was made with a yeast-raised sweet dough on the bottom. ...",

There are several claims to the creation of the cake. The cake was supposedly first made by accident in the 1930s by a St. Louis-area German American baker who was trying to make regular cake batter but reversed the proportions of butter and flour. John Hoffman was the owner of the bakery where the mistake was made. One story is that there were two types of butter \"smears\" used in his bakery: a gooey butter and a deep butter. The deep butter was used for deep butter coffee cakes. The gooey butter was used as an adhesive for things like Danish rolls and stollens. The gooey butter was smeared across the surface, then the item was placed in coconut, hazelnuts, peanuts, crumbs or whatever was desired so they would stick to the product. Hoffman hired a new baker who was supposed to make deep butter cakes, but got the butter smears mixed up. The mistake wasn't caught until after the cakes came out of the proof box. Rather than throw them away, Hoffman went ahead and baked them. This baking mistake was made during the Great Depression, which meant supplies for baking ingredients were low. The new cake sold so well that Hoffman kept baking and selling them and soon, so did the other bakers around St. Louis.\nAnother St. Louis baker, Fred Heimburger, also remembers the cake coming on the scene in the 1930s, as a slip up that became a popular hit and local acquired taste. He liked it well enough that Mr. Heimburger tried to promote gooey butter cake by taking samples of it with him when he traveled out of St. Louis to visit other bakers in their shops. They liked it, but they couldn't get their customers to buy it. Their reactions tending to regard it as looking too much like a mistake, and \"a flat gooey mess\". And so it remained as a regional favorite for many decades. Other stories surround the cake's creation; none have been historically verified.\nGooey butter cake is also commonly known outside of the St. Louis area as \"ooey gooey butter cake\", due to its popularization by celebrity chef Paula Deen.\nMany St. Louis area grocery stores sell fresh or boxed gooey butter cakes. Haas Baking sold a widely distributed, square and packaged version in a box that depicts a colorful, if anachronistic scene of aviator Charles Lindbergh's plane the Spirit of St. Louis flying past downtown St. Louis, the Gateway Arch and the modern cityscape in clouds. Independent or family bakeries make gooey butter cakes, from a time when there were still many neighborhood corner German and Austrian American bakeries in St. Louis, in neighborhoods like Dutchtown, Bevo Mill, and the Tower Grove area, and others. There are now several businesses that specialize in different flavors of gooey butter cake and sell them in coffee shops, or to walk in customers, or by order or shipment.\nPanera Bread Company (original name: St. Louis Bread Company) makes a Danish with a gooey butter filling for the St. Louis market. More recently, Walgreens sells wrapped, individual slices of a version of St. Louis gooey butter cake as a snack alongside muffins, brownies, and cookies.\nGooey butter cake is now widely available outside of the St. Louis area, as Walmart has been marketing a version called Paula Deen Baked Goods Original Gooey Butter Cake. While Walmart still sells a gooey butter cake, they dropped the Paula Deen version.\nGooey butter cake (\"butter cake\") is also widely popular in German-style bakeries throughout the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area, as well as down the Jersey shore. Wawa has started selling different flavors of individually-wrapped gooey butter cakes.\nModern versions of this confection, originally sold as a breakfast pastry or \"coffee cake\", have shown up on upscale restaurant menus across the Midwest and even the West coast.\nOn the SyFy television series Defiance, Nolan and Rafe discuss gooey butter cake while in \"Old St. Louis\" in the episode \"Down In the Ground Where the Dead Men Go\".

Sfenj was an important part of Andalusi culture, whose role was best summarized by a verse from a contemporary poet: \"The sfenj bakers are worth as much as kings\" (\"\u0633\u0641\u0627\u062c\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0633\u0628\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0644\u0648\u0643\u0627\").\nIt is unclear how sfenj first spread to the Maghreb, although it is said to have been well known to the Marinid Dynasty, which ruled Morocco from 1270 to 1465. It spread to France during the 13th century, where it inspired beignets. Sfenj were only sweetened with sugar starting in the 18th century, even though sugarcane has been widely cultivated in the Arab world since the 8th century. Before that, they were sweetened with honey or syrup, or simply served plain.\nAlthough sfenj comes from Al-Andalus, most bakers and sellers of sfenj in the Maghreb have traditionally been Amazigh (Berbers). The nomadic Amazigh are thought to have spread sfenj throughout the Maghreb aided in that by merchants who traveled across the region.\nDedicated sfenj bakers, called sufn\u0101j (\u0633\u0641\u0646\u0627\u062c), soon appeared throughout the Maghreb, attesting to the dessert's popularity. Sufn\u0101jeen (plural of sufn\u0101j) became central figures in the social life of Maghrebi neighborhoods, as they interacted with almost every household in their community every morning, and working as a sufn\u0101j was considered a respectable career. In a traditional sfenj bakery, the sufn\u0101j (and their large circular fryer) sit on an elevated platform, raised slightly above the rest of the bakery, which is already raised more than a meter off the ground. Customers surround this platform and try to catch the sufn\u0101j's attention to place their orders by raising their hand at him or her and shouting.\nTraditional sufn\u0101jeen are quickly going extinct in the modern Maghreb, as a result of the rise of industrial bakeries and the proliferation of sfenj recipes over the Internet blogosphere.\nSfinz (Arabic: \u0633\u0641\u0646\u0632) is a Libyan doughnut. Sfinz is eaten sprinkled with sugar or soaked in honey or date molasses. It can be eaten for Friday breakfast or with afternoon tea. Though it is eaten year-round, it is especially popular during the winter months and around Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr. It is the Libyan version of the sfenj doughnuts that are widely popular across the other countries of the Maghreb.\nSfinz can also be prepared with a fried egg in the center. The egg can be runny or hard, and is often topped with cheese.\nSfenj entered Israeli culture before 1948, as Maghrebi Jews brought it with them when they immigrated to Mandatory Palestine. Sfenj quickly became popular for Hanukkah, as it is easy to prepare at home. However, sfenj's ease of preparation contributed to its loss of popularity in Israel when the Histadrut, Israel's national labor union, pushed to make the jelly-filled sufganiyah the traditional food of Hanukkah , during the late 1920s. Making sufganiyot well can only be done by professional bakers, and the Histadrut wanted sufganiyot to supplant the home-made latkes in order to secure jobs for Jewish bakers. Their effort was successful: by 2016, Israel's 7 million Jews were eating 20 million sufganiyot per year. More Israeli Jews report eating sufganiyot for Hanukkah than fasting for Yom Kippur.\nIn addition to ordinary sfenj, there are two special varieties of sfenj, not counting the different toppings (honey, syrup, and sugar) sfenj can have:\nSfenj matifiyya (\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0641\u064a\u0629), sfenj that is pounded flat and then fried a second time\nSfenj matifiyya bil-baydh (\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636), sfenj matifiyya with an egg added before refrying\nSfenj's importance to Moroccan culture is reflected in several idioms in Moroccan Arabic, including:\n\"Give someone a sfenj and he'll say it's ugly\" (\u0635\u0627\u0628 \u0633\u0641\u0646\u062c\u0629 \u0648\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0639\u0648\u062c\u0629), meaning \"do not judge a book by its cover\" or \"do not bite the hand that feeds you.\"\n\"As if hitting a dog with a sfenj\" (\u0627\u0628\u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0636\u0631\u0628\u062a\u064a \u0643\u0644\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062c\u0629), meaning a futile or Sisyphean endeavor, especially an act of pointless petty revenge (because if someone hits a dog with a sfenj, the dog will eat and like it).\n\"Demanding oil from a sufn\u0101j\" (\u0627\u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u0641\u0646\u0627\u062c), meaning \"taking from the needy\" (because a sufn\u0101j\u2014a sfenj baker\u2014uses large amounts of cooking oil).\n\nMoroccan cuisine\nArab cuisine\nBu\u00f1uelo, the Latin American equivalent\nFrittelle, the Italian equivalent\nList of doughnut varieties\nList of Moroccan dishes\nList of Middle Eastern dishes\nSfinz\nSufganiyah\nZalabiyeh\nBenlafouih, Caroline. \"Sfenj Recipe - Moroccan Doughnuts or Fritters\".

Cavatappi is an Italian word created by compounding cava and tappi, which literally means \"stopper (or top or cap) extractor\" (a corkscrew). It is known by many other names.\nCavatappi is a generic name adopted by other brands that imitated Barilla's cellentani. This particular shape was born in the 1970s at Barilla in Parma when a set of pasta dies had been mistakenly made with a spiral (instead of straight) set of lines. These produced pasta in a spiral or spring (molla in Italian) shape. Barilla decided to name it after one of the most famous showpeople of the time, Adriano Celentano, who was nicknamed \u201cil molleggiato\u201d. As this name was trademarked by Barilla, other pasta producers had to use a less pop and evocative name like cavatappi (corkscrews).\nThe cavatappi shape is perhaps best described as a ridged tube extruded into a helix shape though a small number of rotations. The number of turns is commonly in the range of one to three (with less than one full turn, the shape degenerates into a twisted version of elbow macaroni).\nCavatappi is used with Italian-style foods such as cavatappi Amatriciana, and cavatappi pomodoro. It is mostly found in tomato-based pasta sauces and is associated closely with different types of cheeses such as mozzarella, Parmesan, and provolone. It is a common choice for macaroni and cheese.\n\u00a0Food portal\n\"The Nibble: Pasta Types\". www.thenibble.com.

Vor\u00ed vor\u00ed is a thick, yellow soup with little balls made of cornmeal, corn flour, and cheese very usual in Paraguay and zones of the North-East of Argentina.\nThe name \"vor\u00ed vor\u00ed\" comes from the Guarani language. In Guarani, one way of specifying abundance is by repetition of a word. So, \"vor\u00ed\" is one, but \"vor\u00ed vor\u00ed\" can be two or more.\nThe word \"vor\u00ed\", which names the dish is a derivation of the Spanish word \"bolita\" (\"little ball\", in allusion to the little corn balls found in the dish). The word passed into Guarani as \"borita\", (no 'l' in Guarani) and finally shortened to \"vor\u00ed\". Then, \"vor\u00ed vor\u00ed\" is \"bolita bolita\".\nVori vori is traditionally served during the cold winter months, to keep people warm; although it is eaten occasionally during the summer.\nThe corn flour and the crumbled cheese are put in a container, moistening this mixture with the fat broth until one has a mixture from which the little balls can easily be made by hand.\nEvery vor\u00ed should be the size of a big grape. Once there's enough little balls made, these are put in boiling soup and cooked for about 5 minutes. If the soup turns too thick, it can be thinned by adding more boiling water.\nThe traditional vor\u00ed vor\u00ed is also known as \"vor\u00ed vor\u00ed caldo\".\nOne of the most widespread recipes is the \"vor\u00ed vor\u00ed de gallina\", in which pieces of chicken previously grilled on its own fat are added to the soup.\nWhen the little balls are too small they're called \"tu'i rupi'a\" (the Guarani phrase for \"parakeet eggs\").\nThe vor\u00ed vor\u00ed is one of the few Paraguayan dishes that is eaten among every social layer. It's consumed also in fancy banquets as in the humble tables of rustic ranches.\nAccording to some scholars of social history of Paraguay, all the Paraguayan popular gastronomy, which establishes itself as a small family industry after the Paraguayan War against The Triple Alliance (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, between 1864 and 1870), is really abundant in caloric content, because of the situation that overcame to the country after the conflict. In the aftermath of the war, food was limited, groceries were hard to find. So Paraguayan cooking has a high protein content to make up for the scarcity of every day meal.\n\u201cTembi\u2019u Paraguay\u201d JOSEFINA VELILLA DE AQUINO\n\u201cKar\u00fa rek\u00f3 \u2013 Antropolog\u00eda culinaria paraguaya\u201d, MARGARITA MIR\u00d3 IBARS\n\"Guarani Fusion Kitchen\" Food Blog www.guaranifusionkitchen.com",

Imoni (\u828b\u716e) is a type of taro and meat soup eaten traditionally in the autumn in the T\u014dhoku region of Japan. Yamagata Prefecture in particular is famous for its imoni, but other prefectures in the region also have their own different varieties.\nImoni is eaten like any soup, primarily during the late summer and early autumn, but is most famous as an outdoor food. In the autumn, groups of people preparing imoni around a fire near a river is considered a sign of the season, and convenience stores maintain a stock of firewood and other supplies just for the occasion.\nIn Yamagata Prefecture in particular, and its neighbours in general, imonikai (\u828b\u716e\u4f1a \"imoni parties\") are an important autumn tradition. Tourists flock to Yamagata for the Autumn Imoni Festival (Akino Imonikai) where they join local residents on the banks of the Mamigasaki River on the first Sunday in September, to eat imoni from a gigantic iron kettle, which uses a building crane to add ingredients and stir the pot. In 2009 the festival served imoni to 30,000 guests before the pot was empty.\nMany schools and work organisations in Northern Japan arrange imonikai for their students or employees. Through September and October it is common to see groups of imonikai revellers on the banks of rivers, even near major highways.\nList of Japanese soups and stews\nNabemono\nJapanese regional cuisine\nList of Japanese dishes\nJNTO Website | Find a Location | Yamagata | Yamagata City and its surroundings",

Chocolate syrup is a sweet, chocolate-flavored condiment. It is often used as a topping or dessert sauce for various desserts, such as ice cream, or mixed with milk to make chocolate milk or blended with milk and ice cream to make a chocolate milkshake. Chocolate syrup is sold in a variety of consistencies, ranging from a thin liquid that can be drizzled from a bottle to a thick sauce that needs to be spooned onto the dessert item. \nChocolate syrup is also used to top puddings and cakes. Some restaurants use an artistic drizzling of chocolate syrup to decorate servings of cheesecake or cake, along with other decorations such as cocoa powder, powdered sugar or chocolate shavings. Some brands of chocolate syrup are marketed as chocolate milk syrup (e.g., Nesquik). Other brands are marketed as ice cream sundae toppings.\nChocolate syrup was often used in black-and-white movies to simulate blood, because it was safe for the performers to swallow, easy to get out of clothing, and cheap to buy. It is also useful on black and white film for realistic viscosity. It was used in many movies, including The Wasp Woman and Psycho.\nBeginning in the 1890s, chocolate syrup was also marketed as a treatment for ailments, including for infants suffering from colic. In part due to the passage of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which required clear and accurate labeling, chocolate syrup began to transition from primarily medical application to commercial use.\nFox's U-bet chocolate syrup\nSomebody's Mother's Chocolate Sauce\nBosco Chocolate Syrup\nHershey's Chocolate Syrup\nCulver's Chocolate Syrup\nNestle Nesquik Chocolate Syrup\nGanache, the melted chocolate and cream preparation\nHot fudge, a thick chocolate sauce\nList of dessert sauces\nList of syrups\n\"HERSHEY'S Chocolate Syrup\".

The poppy seed roll is a pastry consisting of a roll of sweet yeast bread (a viennoiserie) with a dense, rich, bittersweet filling of poppy seed. An alternative filling is a paste of minced walnuts, or minced chestnuts.\nIt is popular in Central Europe and parts of Eastern Europe, where it is commonly eaten at Christmas and Easter time.\nIt is traditional in several cuisines, including Polish (makowiec), \nKashubian (mak\u00f3wc), Hungarian (m\u00e1kos bejgli), Slovak (makovn\u00edk), Czech (makov\u00fd z\u00e1vin), Austrian (Mohnstrudel or Mohnstriezel), Ukrainian (pyrih z makom \u043f\u0438\u0440i\u0433 \u0437 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c or makivnyk \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0456\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a), Belarusian (makavy rulet \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0432\u044b \u0440\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0442), Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian (makovnja\u010da), Slovenian (makova potica), Romanian (coarda cu mac or coarda cu nuc\u0103), Lithuanian (aguon\u0173 vyniotinis), Latvian (magonmaizite), Russian (rulet s makom \u0440\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0441 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c), Danish (wienerbr\u00f8d, or Vienna bread), and Yiddish (mohn roll).\nThe poppy seed filling is a paste of ground poppy seeds, milk, butter, sugar and/or honey, often with additional flavorings such as lemon zest and juice. It may have raisins. The walnut filling is a paste of ground walnuts, milk, butter, sugar, and raisins, often with additional flavorings such as coffee or orange zest.\nA very long roll may be bent so that it fits on a baking sheet; the result is called a patk\u00f3 (Hungarian: horseshoe) in Hungarian. Before baking, the roll may be given a wash of milk. The roll can be finished with an icing after baking, made of powdered sugar and lemon juice (or a glaze during baking). Usually it is brought from the kitchen already sliced.\nIn Hungarian cuisine, the rolls, one with each filling, are served together. The combination is known as m\u00e1kos \u00e9s di\u00f3s (poppy seed and walnut). However, in some English language cookbooks there may be no mention of the walnut filling, as if poppy seed were the only filling used. Some other food writers combine the poppy seeds and walnuts together in one filling.\nBecause Polish and Czech culture have intermingled, immigrants to America sometimes use the term \"Kolache\" to describe it.\nAs a new trend, a chestnut-filled variant (geszteny\u00e9s bejgli) is emerging, mainly among younger urban families.\nNazook (also spelled nazuk or nazouk, Armenian \u0546\u0561\u0566\u0578\u0582\u056f, Persian \u0646\u0627\u0632\u0648\u06a9) is the name of an Armenian pastry made from flour, butter, sugar, sour cream, yeast, vanilla extract and eggs, with a filling often made with nuts, and especially walnuts. Nazook is sometimes referred to as gata.\nNokul or lokum is a type of puff pastry made in Turkey and Bulgaria, with variations. It consists of a rolled sheet of yeast dough onto which feta-style white cheese, walnut or poppy seed is sprinkled over a thin coat of butter.

Russian tea cake is a kind of pastry, often eaten around Christmas in the United States. It is a form of jumble, a pastry common in England during the Middle Ages.\nA reason for the common name \"Russian Tea Cake\" or any connection to Russian cuisine is unknown. Some have speculated the recipes either derived from other Eastern European shortbread cookies, may have migrated to Mexico with European nuns, or may have been associated with cookies served beside Russian samovars (tea urns). By the 20th century, they were a part of wedding and Christmas and Easter traditions in the U.S., known by their popular \"Russian tea cake\" or \"Mexican wedding cookie\" name.\nList of American desserts\nList of Russian desserts\nBrief history of Russian Tea Cakes at RussianTeaCake.com\nSchrambling, Regina (2013). \"The One Christmas Cookie That's Made the World Over\".

Simnel cake is a fruitcake widely eaten in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other countries with patterns of migration from them, associated with Lent and Easter. It is distinguished by layers of almond paste or marzipan, typically one in the middle and one on top, and a set of eleven balls made of the same paste. It was originally made for the fourth Sunday in Lent, also known as Laetare Sunday, the Refreshment Sunday of Lent (when the 40-day fast would be relaxed), Mothering Sunday, the Sunday of the Five Loaves, or Simnel Sunday; named after the cake. In the United Kingdom it is now commonly associated with Easter Sunday.\nConventionally, 11 marzipan balls are used to decorate the cake, symbolising the 12 apostles minus Judas Iscariot, or occasionally 12 are used, representing Jesus and the 11 apostles. However, an early reference to decorating with marzipan balls appears in May Byron's Pot-Luck Cookery, but with no mention of this story, and her version may well be derived from earlier styles, which were sometimes crenelated.\nSimnel cakes have been known since at least medieval times. Bread regulations of the time suggest they were boiled and then baked, a technique which led to an invention myth, in circulation from at least 1745 until the 1930s, whereby a mythical couple, Simon and Nelly, fall out over making a Simnel. One wishes to boil it, one to bake it and, after beating each other with various household implements, they compromise on one which uses both cooking techniques. \nSimnel cakes are often associated with Mothering Sunday, also known as Simnel Sunday. According to historian Ronald Hutton, in 17th Century Gloucestershire and Worcestershire the custom of live-in apprentices and domestic servants going home to visit their mothers on Mothering Sunday started, checking that their families were well and taking food or money if needed. This was a time of year when food stocks were low, and the high-calorie simnel cake was useful nutrition. The cake later became simply an Easter cake.\nThe meaning of the word \"simnel\" is unclear: there is a 1226 reference to \"bread made into a simnel\", which is understood to mean the finest white bread, from the Latin simila, \"fine flour\" (from which 'semolina' also derives). John de Garlande felt that the word was equivalent to placenta cake, a cake that was intended to please.\nDifferent towns had their own recipes and shapes of the Simnel cake. Both Bury and Shrewsbury produced large numbers to their own recipes. Chambers Book of Days (1869) contains an illustration of the Shrewsbury Simnel cake, of which says:\n\"It is an old custom in Shropshire and Herefordshire, and especially at Shrewsbury, to make during Lent and Easter, and also at Christmas, a sort of rich and expensive cakes, which are called Simnel Cakes. They are raised cakes, the crust of which is made of fine flour and water, with sufficient saffron to give it a deep yellow colour, and the interior is filled with the materials of a very rich plum-cake, with plenty of candied lemon peel, and other good things. They are made up very stiff; tied up in a cloth, and boiled for several hours, after which they are brushed over with egg, and then baked. When ready for sale the crust is as hard as if made of wood ... the accompanying engraving, representing large and small cakes as now on sale in Shrewsbury. The usage of these cakes is evidently one of great antiquity.\"\nToday, in Shrewsbury, as elsewhere in England, the Simnel cake is usually made with the Bury recipe.\nList of almond dishes\nList of foods with religious symbolism\nMazurek (cake)\n\"Mothering Sunday\". bbc.co.uk.

The poppy seed roll is a pastry consisting of a roll of sweet yeast bread (a viennoiserie) with a dense, rich, bittersweet filling of poppy seed. An alternative filling is a paste of minced walnuts, or minced chestnuts.\nIt is popular in Central Europe and parts of Eastern Europe, where it is commonly eaten at Christmas and Easter time.\nIt is traditional in several cuisines, including Polish (makowiec), \nKashubian (mak\u00f3wc), Hungarian (m\u00e1kos bejgli), Slovak (makovn\u00edk), Czech (makov\u00fd z\u00e1vin), Austrian (Mohnstrudel or Mohnstriezel), Ukrainian (pyrih z makom \u043f\u0438\u0440i\u0433 \u0437 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c or makivnyk \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0456\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a), Belarusian (makavy rulet \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0432\u044b \u0440\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0442), Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian (makovnja\u010da), Slovenian (makova potica), Romanian (coarda cu mac or coarda cu nuc\u0103), Lithuanian (aguon\u0173 vyniotinis), Latvian (magonmaizite), Russian (rulet s makom \u0440\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0441 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c), Danish (wienerbr\u00f8d, or Vienna bread), and Yiddish (mohn roll).\nThe poppy seed filling is a paste of ground poppy seeds, milk, butter, sugar and/or honey, often with additional flavorings such as lemon zest and juice. It may have raisins. The walnut filling is a paste of ground walnuts, milk, butter, sugar, and raisins, often with additional flavorings such as coffee or orange zest.\nA very long roll may be bent so that it fits on a baking sheet; the result is called a patk\u00f3 (Hungarian: horseshoe) in Hungarian. Before baking, the roll may be given a wash of milk. The roll can be finished with an icing after baking, made of powdered sugar and lemon juice (or a glaze during baking). Usually it is brought from the kitchen already sliced.\nIn Hungarian cuisine, the rolls, one with each filling, are served together. The combination is known as m\u00e1kos \u00e9s di\u00f3s (poppy seed and walnut). However, in some English language cookbooks there may be no mention of the walnut filling, as if poppy seed were the only filling used. Some other food writers combine the poppy seeds and walnuts together in one filling.\nBecause Polish and Czech culture have intermingled, immigrants to America sometimes use the term \"Kolache\" to describe it.\nAs a new trend, a chestnut-filled variant (geszteny\u00e9s bejgli) is emerging, mainly among younger urban families.\nNazook (also spelled nazuk or nazouk, Armenian \u0546\u0561\u0566\u0578\u0582\u056f, Persian \u0646\u0627\u0632\u0648\u06a9) is the name of an Armenian pastry made from flour, butter, sugar, sour cream, yeast, vanilla extract and eggs, with a filling often made with nuts, and especially walnuts. Nazook is sometimes referred to as gata.\nNokul or lokum is a type of puff pastry made in Turkey and Bulgaria, with variations. It consists of a rolled sheet of yeast dough onto which feta-style white cheese, walnut or poppy seed is sprinkled over a thin coat of butter. The dough is then rolled, cut into individual portions, and baked.

Limpa (swedish for Loaf)  is a sweet Scandinavian rye bread, associated with Swedish cuisine. It is a yeast-leavened spice loaf, sweetened with brown sugar and molasses which comes in a large variety in regards to whether or not butter-enriched, and which spices are being used. Traditional bread spices are anise,  caraway, fennel seeds and bitter orange.\nTypically baked during the Christmas season, the festive wort breads / loaves (Swedish: v\u00f6rtbr\u00f6d / v\u00f6rtlimpa)I are flavoured with spices like anise, caraway and fennel seeds, and often orange rinds, raisins or sultanas, and dark beer, in addition to the wort. Its distinct taste and look is in large part due to the addition of wort to the dough, making it similar to a malt loaf.  It is a typical dish for a traditional Christmas Eve sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord or julbord. Limpa bread pairs well with jams and jellies, or cream cheese.\nThe first step for making the bread is to bring molasses, brown sugar, caraway seeds, wort and water to a gentle boil, then to add shortening or butter and citrus rind. Once this mixture has cooled to a lukewarm temperature it is combined with activated yeast and rye flour. The dough rises and more flour is added to knead the dough in preparation for a second rise, then the tops are brushed with melted butter and the loaves are baked.  Some recipes add the molasses mixture to the dry ingredients after the rye flour has been scalded with hot water.\nJulekake\nList of breads\nList of Christmas dishes\nSmith, Leslie. \"Scandinavian Ideas for a South Dakota Christmas\".

It may have raisins. The walnut filling is a paste of ground walnuts, milk, butter, sugar, and raisins, often with additional flavorings such as coffee or orange zest.\nA very long roll may be bent so that it fits on a baking sheet; the result is called a patk\u00f3 (Hungarian: horseshoe) in Hungarian. Before baking, the roll may be given a wash of milk. The roll can be finished with an icing after baking, made of powdered sugar and lemon juice (or a glaze during baking). Usually it is brought from the kitchen already sliced.\nIn Hungarian cuisine, the rolls, one with each filling, are served together.

A Dagwood sandwich is a tall, multilayered sandwich made with a variety of meats, cheeses, and condiments. It is named after Dagwood Bumstead, a central character in the comic strip Blondie, who is frequently illustrated making enormous sandwiches. According to Blondie scripter Dean Young, his father, Chic Young, began drawing the huge sandwiches in the comic strip during 1936.\nIn 1951, businessmen Bob Weiler and Art Lang opened a Dagwood-themed restaurant in Toledo, Ohio, with hopes of establishing a national chain. They had not licensed the Dagwood name and were ordered to stop using it by King Features.\nA Dagwood Diner (spelled \"Dag-Wood\") operated in Ann Arbor, Michigan, until 1971.\nAssorted lunch meats featuring Dagwood have been sold at grocery stores. In May 1999, a counter-service restaurant named Blondie's opened at Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure, serving a traditional Dagwood-style sandwich. Blondie's bills itself as \"Home of the Dagwood Sandwich.\" The exterior displays a 20-foot plastic Dagwood sandwich over the entrance.\nDenny's in the early 2000s offered their breakfast Dagwood; it contained over a thousand calories. It was later removed from their menu.\nDagwood's Sandwich Shoppes, a Blondie-themed restaurant chain founded in 2006, had franchise locations open in Florida, Kentucky, Indiana, Missouri, and Georgia that have all closed as of 2011. The chain struggled financially and never reached the growth anticipated by its founders. Two lawsuits were filed alleging mismanagement, fraud, embezzlement, and deliberate deception of the chain's financial state as it collapsed. The Dagwood was sold as a 1.5-pound sandwich. The Dagwood sandwich served in the Dagwood Sandwich Shoppes included the following ingredients: three slices of deli bread, Genoa salami, ham, pepperoni, turkey, cheddar cheese, provolone, lettuce, tomato, roasted red bell peppers, banana peppers, red onion, deli mustard, and low calorie mayonnaise.\nCincinnati-based chain Penn Station East Coast Subs refers to its \"create-it-yourself\" submarine sandwich as a Dagwood. A customer may include up to five meats, and any combination of available condiments and vegetables.\nDagwoods are also a popular sandwich in South African takeaway (fast-food) restaurants and roadhouses, both in small street-side stands and larger chains. A South African Dagwood is usually made with three slices of toasted bread with a hamburger patty (or two), along with lettuce, tomato, and a fried egg. Other common accoutrements may be added and the beef patty may be replaced by savory mince reminiscent of an American sloppy joe, but it seems to be the fried egg and double-decker nature of the sandwich that characterizes a South African Dagwood.\nIn 2008, Man v. Food host Adam Richman visited Columbus, Ohio, and partook in the Ohio Deli and Restaurant's Dagwood Challenge. The challenge was to eat a 2-1\u20442-pound Dagwood sandwich, plus a full pound of French fries, within 30 minutes. Richman successfully ate the sandwich and fries in 20 of the 30 minutes and was awarded with commemorative T-shirt.\nDagwood's Deli and Sub Shop opened in Indiana in 1985, now serving several locations.  On the menu is a \"Dagwood Supreme\", which includes roast beef, ham, turkey, provolone and Colby cheeses, lettuce, tomato, and onions and a \"Dagwood\" sauce.\nDagwoods Sandwichs et Salades is a fast-food chain operating in Canada. It was founded in 1989 in Montr\u00e9al but subsequently expanded throughout Qu\u00e9bec and into Eastern Ontario.\nCaspar Milquetoast\nDream of the Rarebit Fiend\nJiggs dinner\nList of American sandwiches\nList of sandwiches\nSandwich loaf, a type of party food made from a whole loaf of bread\n\"History of Dagwood Sandwich\".

Kue talam was introduced by the Sino-Burmese to Lower Myanmar, where it is known as kway talan (\u1000\u103d\u1031\u1010\u102c\u101c\u1014\u103a\u1038).\nKue talam usually has two layers; the top one is white made from savoury creamy coconut milk, while the bottom one is coloured according to each variant's recipe.

One of the oldest known records of the word tjendol is listed in the 1866 Oost-Indisch kookboek or East Indies recipe book. This book includes a cendol recipe with the title \"Tjendol of Dawet\" which indicates that cendol and dawet were already used synonymously at that time. In the dictionary Supplement op het Maleisch-Nederduitsch Woordenboek (1869) by Jan Pijnappel (Gz.), tjendol is described as a kind of drink or watery paste made from sago, coconut milk, sugar and salt.\nIn Malaya, the word \"chendol\" was first mentioned in 1932 as one of the foodstuffs available in Kuala Lumpur as recorded in the Malay Concordance Project that collects Malay writings.\nThere is a popular belief that the name \"cendol\" is related to, or originated from, the word jendol, in reference to the swollen green worm-like rice flour jelly; in Javanese, Sundanese, Indonesian, and Malay, jendol means \"bump,\" \"bulge,\" or \"swollen.\" In most parts of Indonesia, cendol refer to the green rice flour jelly; while the concoction of that green rice flour jellies with coconut milk, shaved ice, areca palm sugar and sometimes diced jackfruit is called es cendol (in West Java) or dawet (in Central and East Java).\nThe Indonesian dictionary Kamus Besar describes cendol as a snack made from rice flour and other ingredients that are formed by filters, then mixed with palm sugar and coconut milk (for beverage). The Malay dictionary Kamus Dewan similarly defines it as a porridge-like drink with long strands made of rice flour in coconut milk and sugar syrup.\nIn Vietnam, this worm-like rice flour concoction is called b\u00e1nh l\u1ecdt or \"fall through cake\". B\u00e1nh l\u1ecdt is a common ingredient in a Vietnamese dessert drink called ch\u00e8, or more commonly ch\u00e8 ba m\u00e0u. In Thailand it is called lot chong (Thai: \u0e25\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07, [l\u0254\u0302\u02d0t t\u0361\u0255\u02b0\u0254\u0302\u014b]) which can be translated as \"gone through a hole\", indicating the way it is made by pressing the warm dough through a sieve into a container of cold water. In Burma, it is known as mont let saung or \u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u101c\u1000\u103a\u1006\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1038. In Cambodia, it is known as lot (\u179b\u178f /l\u0254\u02d0t/), bang-aem lot (\u1794\u1784\u17d2\u17a2\u17c2\u1798\u179b\u178f /b\u0251\u014b\u0294a\u025bm l\u0254\u02d0t/), nom lot (\u1793\u17c6\u179b\u178f /n\u0277m l\u0254\u02d0t/), and banh lot (\u1794\u17b6\u1789\u17cb\u179b\u178f /ba\u0272 l\u0254\u02d0t/).\nThe origin of cendol is not clear, and this sweet drink is widely spread across Southeast Asia. However, one suggestion is that cendol originated in Java, Indonesia as dawet.  The Javanese name of \"dawet\" was recorded in early 19th century Javanese manuscript of Serat Centhini, composed between 1814 and 1823 in Surakarta, Central Java. An Indonesian academic suggests that a dawet sweet drink may have been recorded in the Kresnayana manuscript, dated from Kediri Kingdom circa 12th century Java. In Java, dawet refer to the whole concoction of cendol green jellies, usually made from aren sagoo or rice flour, coconut milk and liquid gula jawa (palm sugar syrup). An Indonesian historian argues that sagoo or rice flour might have been used as sweet beverage ingredient in the rice agriculture society of ancient Java. Indeed, cendol jellies and its variations are rural agricultural product, still traditionally produced in Javanese villages. In Banjarnegara, Central Java, dawet is traditionally served without ice. Today, however additional ice cubes or shaved ice is commonly added into this dessert drink. \nCendol, however, has developed differently in different countries.  In Indonesia, cendol only refers to the green \"pandan jelly served in coconut milk\", where sometimes pandanus leaves or pieces of jackfruit may be added. This is different to the cendol in Malaysia and Singapore where various ingredients such as sweetened red beans and sweet corn may be mixed in like an es campur.\nCendol is typically served with ice, and this may have developed when ice became readily available. It may have originated in Malayan",

Tangyuan (traditional Chinese: \u6e6f\u5713; simplified Chinese: \u6c64\u5706; pinyin: t\u0101ngyu\u00e1n; lit. 'soup ball')  is a Chinese dessert consisting of balls of glutinous rice flour and water that are deep-fried or boiled and served in a hot broth or syrup. Tangyuan can be either small or large and filled or unfilled. They are traditionally eaten during the Lantern Festival, but because the name of the dish is a homophone for union (traditional Chinese: \u5718\u5713; simplified Chinese: \u56e2\u5706; pinyin: tu\u00e1nyu\u00e1n) they are also served on wedding days, at family reunions, and during the D\u014dngzh\u00ec (winter solstice) festival.\nThe food has had several names. During the Yongle era of the Ming Dynasty, it was called yuanxiao (derived from the Yuanxiao Festival) in northern China. This name means \"first evening\", as the festival takes place in the first full moon after the Chinese New Year, which is always a new moon.\nPeople in southern China called the food tangyuan or tangtuan. In the Hakka and Cantonese varieties of Chinese, tangyuan is pronounced as \"tong rhen\" or \"tong jyun\". The term tangtuan (Hakka: tong ton, Cantonese: tong tun) is not commonly used.  Legend has it that during Yuan Shikai's rule from 1912 to 1916, he disliked the name yuanxiao (Chinese: \u5143\u5bb5) because it sounded identical to \"remove Yuan\" (Chinese: \u8881\u6d88); thus he gave orders to change the name to tangyuan. This new moniker literally means \"round balls in soup\" or \"round dumplings in soup\". Nowadays however, \"tangyuan\" usually refers to the southern style, while \"yuanxiao\" refers to the northern style, differentiated by their method of preparation.\nThis type of glutinous rice flour dumpling is eaten in both northern and southern China. Sweet fillings such as sugar, sesame, osmanthus flowers, sweet bean paste and sweetened tangerine peel are used.\nIn northern China, \"yuanxiao\" is made by rolling small pieces of hardened filling in dry glutinous rice flour, adding water slowly, until it becomes a ball with a diameter of roughly 2 centimeters, whereas the southern \"tangyuan\", is made by wrapping soft filling in a glutinous rice \"dough\" similar to making a dumpling.\nIn the South, it is common to have tang yuan plain in a savory soup made with Chinese (daikon) radish and home made fish cake.\nFor many Chinese families in mainland China as well as overseas, tangyuan is typically eaten together with family. The round shape of the balls and the bowls in which they are served symbolize family cohesion.\nTangyuan are first cooked in boiling water. Once cooked, the savory tangyuan are served in a clear soup broth, while sweet tangyuan are served in a ginger-infused syrup. Nowadays, deep-fried tangyuan have gained popularity in the Southern part of China. Filled tangyuan are put into hot oil to make its surface crispy (this is for deep-fried tangyuan).\nUnfilled tangyuan are served as part of a sweet dessert soup known in Cantonese cuisine as tong sui (literally:\"sugar water\"). Common types include:\nRed bean soup\nBlack sesame soup\nGinger and rock sugar\nFermented glutinous rice (Chinese: \u91aa\u7cdf or \u9152\u91c0), Sweet Osmanthus and rock sugar.\nThe most renowned varieties come from Ningbo in Zhejiang Province. However, they are traditionally eaten throughout China.\nTangyuan has also come to be associated with the Winter Solstice and Chinese New Year in various regions. Today, the food is eaten all year round. Mass-produced tangyuan is commonly found in the frozen food section of Asian supermarkets in China and overseas.\nIn Indonesia, an adapted version, called Wedang Ronde (Wedang in Javanese means beverage, and Ronde means round ball), is a popular food eaten during cold temperatures. The round colored balls of glutinous rice can be filled with crushed peanuts and sugar, or left plain and is served in a sweetened, mild ginger broth often boiled in fragrant pandan leaves.

Cendol /\u02c8t\u0283\u025bnd\u0252l/ is an iced sweet dessert that contains droplets of green rice flour jelly, coconut milk and palm sugar syrup. It is commonly found in Southeast Asia and is popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and Myanmar. Next to the green jelly, additional toppings might be added, including diced jackfruit, sweetened red azuki beans, or durian.\nEarliest written records of the word cendol or tjendol (Dutch spelling) can be traced to dictionaries and books of the 19th century in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). One of the oldest known records of the word tjendol is listed in the 1866 Oost-Indisch kookboek or East Indies recipe book. This book includes a cendol recipe with the title \"Tjendol of Dawet\" which indicates that cendol and dawet were already used synonymously at that time. In the dictionary Supplement op het Maleisch-Nederduitsch Woordenboek (1869) by Jan Pijnappel (Gz.), tjendol is described as a kind of drink or watery paste made from sago, coconut milk, sugar and salt.\nIn Malaya, the word \"chendol\" was first mentioned in 1932 as one of the foodstuffs available in Kuala Lumpur as recorded in the Malay Concordance Project that collects Malay writings.\nThere is a popular belief that the name \"cendol\" is related to, or originated from, the word jendol, in reference to the swollen green worm-like rice flour jelly; in Javanese, Sundanese, Indonesian, and Malay, jendol means \"bump,\" \"bulge,\" or \"swollen.\" In most parts of Indonesia, cendol refer to the green rice flour jelly; while the concoction of that green rice flour jellies with coconut milk, shaved ice, areca palm sugar and sometimes diced jackfruit is called es cendol (in West Java) or dawet (in Central and East Java).\nThe Indonesian dictionary Kamus Besar describes cendol as a snack made from rice flour and other ingredients that are formed by filters, then mixed with palm sugar and coconut milk (for beverage). The Malay dictionary Kamus Dewan similarly defines it as a porridge-like drink with long strands made of rice flour in coconut milk and sugar syrup.\nIn Vietnam, this worm-like rice flour concoction is called b\u00e1nh l\u1ecdt or \"fall through cake\". B\u00e1nh l\u1ecdt is a common ingredient in a Vietnamese dessert drink called ch\u00e8, or more commonly ch\u00e8 ba m\u00e0u. In Thailand it is called lot chong (Thai: \u0e25\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07, [l\u0254\u0302\u02d0t t\u0361\u0255\u02b0\u0254\u0302\u014b]) which can be translated as \"gone through a hole\", indicating the way it is made by pressing the warm dough through a sieve into a container of cold water. In Burma, it is known as mont let saung or \u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u101c\u1000\u103a\u1006\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1038. In Cambodia, it is known as lot (\u179b\u178f /l\u0254\u02d0t/), bang-aem lot (\u1794\u1784\u17d2\u17a2\u17c2\u1798\u179b\u178f /b\u0251\u014b\u0294a\u025bm l\u0254\u02d0t/), nom lot (\u1793\u17c6\u179b\u178f /n\u0277m l\u0254\u02d0t/), and banh lot (\u1794\u17b6\u1789\u17cb\u179b\u178f /ba\u0272 l\u0254\u02d0t/).\nThe origin of cendol is not clear, and this sweet drink is widely spread across Southeast Asia. However, one suggestion is that cendol originated in Java, Indonesia as dawet.  The Javanese name of \"dawet\" was recorded in early 19th century Javanese manuscript of Serat Centhini, composed between 1814 and 1823 in Surakarta, Central Java. An Indonesian academic suggests that a dawet sweet drink may have been recorded in the Kresnayana manuscript, dated from Kediri Kingdom circa 12th century Java. In Java, dawet refer to the whole concoction of cendol green jellies, usually made from aren sagoo or rice flour, coconut milk and liquid gula jawa (palm sugar syrup). An Indonesian historian argues that sagoo or rice flour might have been used as sweet beverage ingredient in the rice agriculture society of ancient Java. Indeed, cendol jellies and its variations are rural agricultural product, still traditionally produced in Javanese villages. In Banjarnegara, Central Java, dawet is traditionally served without ice. Today, however additional ice cubes or shaved ice is commonly added into this dessert drink. \nCendol, however, has developed differently in different countries.  In Indonesia, cendol only refers to the green \"pandan jelly served in coconut milk\", where sometimes pandanus leaves or pieces of jackfruit may be added. This is different to the cendol in Malaysia and Singapore where various ingredients such as sweetened red beans and sweet corn may be mixed in like an es campur.\nCendol is typically served with ice, and this may have developed when ice became readily available. It may have originated in Malayan",

Khanom chan (Thai: \u0e02\u0e19\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19, [k\u02b0\u0101n\u01d2m t\u0361\u0255\u02b0\u00e1n]) is an ancient Thai khanom, or dessert, made of tapioca flour, rice flour, and coconut milk, among other ingredients. Originating from the Sukhothai Period, the dessert is a staple snack in Thai cuisine, and Thai people usually prepare it for auspicious ceremonies. \nKhanom chan is fragrant, subtly sweet, and slightly oily from the addition of the coconut milk; its texture is smooth yet sticky.\nIts name derives from two Thai words: \u201ckhanom\u201d (Thai: \u0e02\u0e19\u0e21) meaning \"dessert\", and \u201cchan\u201d (Thai: \u0e0a\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19) meaning \"layer\" or \"layers\". \nThe dessert has its origins in the Sukhothai Period, when foreign trade with China and India contributed to cultural exchanges, including that of food. As a result, the food was developed from ingredients that came from many nations and was adapted to suit the living conditions of local people.\nIn a complete serving, a minimum of nine layers of the dessert are prepared and eaten. The number nine has connotations of prosperity in the Thai language: \"nine\" (Thai: \u0e40\u0e01\u0e49\u0e32) is a homophone of the phrase \"to step forward\" (Thai: \u0e01\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27). As a result, khanom chan is often seen as representing prosperity in life and promotion in one\u2019s occupation.   \nBecause of its positive connotations, khanom chan is often used in sacred ceremonies such as in home philanthropy or weddings; with nine layers or more the snack is believed to bring happiness and progress for both the maker and eater. \nBecause of this belief, some areas of Thailand have given the dessert other names to make it more prosperous, such as khanom chan farh (Thai: \u0e02\u0e19\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32).\nKue lapis, a similar Indonesian kue (dessert)\nThai cuisine\nList of Thai desserts\nList of Thai dishes (includes names in Thai script)\nList of Thai ingredients (includes names in Thai script)\nKhanom Chan Ramkhamhaeng University 2003 \nJunon, Nattapong. \"\u0e02\u0e19\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\". \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e31\u0e15\u0e34\u0e02\u0e19\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19.

Cendol /\u02c8t\u0283\u025bnd\u0252l/ is an iced sweet dessert that contains droplets of green rice flour jelly, coconut milk and palm sugar syrup. It is commonly found in Southeast Asia and is popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and Myanmar. Next to the green jelly, additional toppings might be added, including diced jackfruit, sweetened red azuki beans, or durian.\nEarliest written records of the word cendol or tjendol (Dutch spelling) can be traced to dictionaries and books of the 19th century in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). One of the oldest known records of the word tjendol is listed in the 1866 Oost-Indisch kookboek or East Indies recipe book. This book includes a cendol recipe with the title \"Tjendol of Dawet\" which indicates that cendol and dawet were already used synonymously at that time. In the dictionary Supplement op het Maleisch-Nederduitsch Woordenboek (1869) by Jan Pijnappel (Gz.), tjendol is described as a kind of drink or watery paste made from sago, coconut milk, sugar and salt.\nIn Malaya, the word \"chendol\" was first mentioned in 1932 as one of the foodstuffs available in Kuala Lumpur as recorded in the Malay Concordance Project that collects Malay writings.\nThere is a popular belief that the name \"cendol\" is related to, or originated from, the word jendol, in reference to the swollen green worm-like rice flour jelly; in Javanese, Sundanese, Indonesian, and Malay, jendol means \"bump,\" \"bulge,\" or \"swollen.\" In most parts of Indonesia, cendol refer to the green rice flour jelly; while the concoction of that green rice flour jellies with coconut milk, shaved ice, areca palm sugar and sometimes diced jackfruit is called es cendol (in West Java) or dawet (in Central and East Java).\nThe Indonesian dictionary Kamus Besar describes cendol as a snack made from rice flour and other ingredients that are formed by filters, then mixed with palm sugar and coconut milk (for beverage). The Malay dictionary Kamus Dewan similarly defines it as a porridge-like drink with long strands made of rice flour in coconut milk and sugar syrup.\nIn Vietnam, this worm-like rice flour concoction is called b\u00e1nh l\u1ecdt or \"fall through cake\". B\u00e1nh l\u1ecdt is a common ingredient in a Vietnamese dessert drink called ch\u00e8, or more commonly ch\u00e8 ba m\u00e0u. In Thailand it is called lot chong (Thai: \u0e25\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07, [l\u0254\u0302\u02d0t t\u0361\u0255\u02b0\u0254\u0302\u014b]) which can be translated as \"gone through a hole\", indicating the way it is made by pressing the warm dough through a sieve into a container of cold water. In Burma, it is known as mont let saung or \u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u101c\u1000\u103a\u1006\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1038. In Cambodia, it is known as lot (\u179b\u178f /l\u0254\u02d0t/), bang-aem lot (\u1794\u1784\u17d2\u17a2\u17c2\u1798\u179b\u178f /b\u0251\u014b\u0294a\u025bm l\u0254\u02d0t/), nom lot (\u1793\u17c6\u179b\u178f /n\u0277m l\u0254\u02d0t/), and banh lot (\u1794\u17b6\u1789\u17cb\u179b\u178f /ba\u0272 l\u0254\u02d0t/).\nThe origin of cendol is not clear, and this sweet drink is widely spread across Southeast Asia. However, one suggestion is that cendol originated in Java, Indonesia as dawet.  The Javanese name of \"dawet\" was recorded in early 19th century Javanese manuscript of Serat Centhini, composed between 1814 and 1823 in Surakarta, Central Java. An Indonesian academic suggests that a dawet sweet drink may have been recorded in the Kresnayana manuscript, dated from Kediri Kingdom circa 12th century Java. In Java, dawet refer to the whole concoction of cendol green jellies, usually made from aren sagoo or rice flour, coconut milk and liquid gula jawa (palm sugar syrup). An Indonesian historian argues that sagoo or rice flour might have been used as sweet beverage ingredient in the rice agriculture society of ancient Java. Indeed, cendol jellies and its variations are rural agricultural product, still traditionally produced in Javanese villages. In Banjarnegara, Central Java, dawet is traditionally served without ice. Today, however additional ice cubes or shaved ice is commonly added into this dessert drink. \nCendol, however, has developed differently in different countries.  In Indonesia, cendol only refers to the green \"pandan jelly served in coconut milk\", where sometimes pandanus leaves or pieces of jackfruit may be added. This is different to the cendol in Malaysia and Singapore where various ingredients such as sweetened red beans and sweet corn may be mixed in like an es campur.\nCendol is typically served with ice, and this may have developed when ice became readily available. It may have originated in Malayan",

Traditionally, all guests in Bulgarian and Serbian homes are greeted with a spoonful of slatko/sladko and a cup of water as soon as seated. Particularly honoured guests are offered twice, although any guest can ask for another taste, to honour the housekeeper. For the second taste another spoon must be used. To ask for the third time, if not offered, is regarded as an improper behaviour, although usually granted. Alternatively, in the same manner, the guests may be offered honey (or asked to choose). Prior to the creation of Yugoslavia, the tradition of slatko was common and widespread only in the historical Serbia, south of Sava and Danube and was unknown in Vojvodina or other parts of Austro-Hungarian Empire.\nThe most usual types of slatko are those made of whole strawberries, slightly unripe skinned plums or sour cherries. Other fresh fruits like raspberries, sweet cherries, watermelon cubes, rose petals, quinces, grapes, figs, skinned apricot halves or quarters, peaches, blueberries, blackberries or redcurrants can also be used. If a plum slatko is prepared, walnut halves or almonds may be added to the mixture or even inserted into the plums themselves to replace the pits. Some fruits and vegetables (like rhubarb and physalis) rarely grown in Serbia have also been demonstrated to be well suited for slatko. Frozen berries and fruits may be used as well, but the amount of water and the cooking time should be adjusted accordingly.\nList of dessert sauces\nIrene Veal (1946). Recipes of the United Nations.

The stuffing varies widely according to different regions in Taiwan, but usually consists of a mixture of pork, bamboo shoots, and shiitake mushrooms.

Since then, ba-wan has spread to different regions of Taiwan and is now considered by many as a national food, and can be found in most night markets in Taiwan.

Flavors include azuki bean paste, green tea (matcha), yuzu, strawberry and chestnut. Nagoya is particularly famous for its uir, and there are other regional versions, notably in Yamaguchi and Odawara, although Odawara's uir is better known as a medicine. It can be purchased in traditional Japanese confectionery shops throughout Japan. Uir was originally the name of a medicine in the Muromachi period (13361573). References to uir as a confection first appear in the Wa-Kan Sansai Zue, Ryan Terajima's massive Edo-period dictionary published in 1712.",

White pudding, oatmeal pudding or (in Scotland) mealy pudding is a meat dish popular in Scotland, Ireland, Northumberland, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. \nWhite pudding is broadly similar to black pudding, but does not include blood. Modern recipes consist of suet or fat, oatmeal or barley, breadcrumbs and in some cases pork and pork liver, filled into a natural or cellulose sausage casing. Recipes in previous centuries included a wider range of ingredients.\nWhite pudding is often thought of as a very old dish that, like black pudding, was a traditional way of making use of offal following the annual slaughter of livestock. Whereas black pudding-type recipes appear in Roman sources, white pudding likely has specifically medieval origins, possibly as a culinary descendant of medieval sweetened blancmange-type recipes combining shredded chicken, rice and almonds, or as a way of lightening up offal with the addition of cream, eggs and breadcrumbs. Meatless versions were common, as they could be eaten during the Lenten period of abstinence. Many older recipes are sweetened: a 15th century British pudding combined pork liver, cream, eggs, breadcrumbs, raisins and dates, while a 1588 recipe collection featured a white pudding made of beef suet, breadcrumbs, egg yolk and currants, flavoured with nutmeg, sugar and cinnamon. A similar recipe given in Woolley's 1670 book The Queen-Like Closet used hog's lights and was filled into intestine sausage-skins. By the mid-18th century, Elizabeth Raffald's white pudding recipe, \"White Puddings in Skins\", combined rice, lard, ground almonds, currants and egg, using sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and mace as flavourings; by this period the inclusion of offal such as liver or lights, as well as sweet flavourings, was becoming rarer.\nAn oatmeal pudding recipe found in the 18th century Compleat Housewife is made with beef suet and cream, thickened with oatmeal and mixed up with egg yolks, then baked in a dish with marrow.\nAlongside these more refined and elaborate recipes, a simpler form of white pudding was popular in Ireland, Scotland, and some parts of Northern England, combining suet, oatmeal (or barley in Northumberland), seasoning and onions, in sheep's or cow's intestines.  In Gaelic speaking parts of Scotland and Ireland they were referred to by the names marag gheal or put\u00f3g bh\u00e1n. These oatmeal-based puddings survived into modern Irish and Scottish cuisine, although with significant regional differences. Modern commercially made Scottish white puddings are generally based on oatmeal, onions, and beef suet; the same mixture simply fried in a pan is known as skirlie. In Ireland, white puddings also include a substantial proportion of pork or pork liver and pork fat. Most modern white puddings are filled into a synthetic cellulose casing and boiled or steamed; typical spices used include white pepper, nutmeg, and sage.\nWhite puddings were once also associated with south-western England: Taylor, in the 17th century, mentions \"the white puddings of Somersetshire\". Hog's pudding, still made in Somerset, Cornwall and Devon, is very similar to other white puddings although is somewhat more highly spiced.\nAnother Scottish variant, fruit pudding, includes dried fruit in addition to beef suet and oatmeal.\nBoudin\nGoetta\nHaggis\nRed pudding\nScrapple\nList of Irish dishes\nSee, for instance, James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man: \"White pudding and eggs and sausages and cups of tea!

These charms may be coins or small symbolic objects (e.g., a small piece of a dogwood branch with a bud, symbolizing health or longevity). More recently, people have started writing happy wishes on small pieces of paper and wrapping them in tin foil. Wishes may include happiness, health, or success throughout the new year (similar to fortune cookies).\nBanitsa is served for breakfast with plain yogurt, ayran, or boza. It can be eaten hot or cold. Some varieties include banitsa with spinach \"\u0441\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\" (spanachnik) or the sweet version, banitsa with milk \"\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430\" (mlechna banitsa) or pumpkin \"\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\" (tikvenik).\nThe word \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 derives from the South Slavic \u0433\u044a\u0431\u043d\u046b\u0442\u0438 meaning \"to fold.\"  The word developed from the Proto-Slavic form *\u0433\u044b\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 > *\u0433\u044a\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 > *\u0433\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 > \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430.\n\nTraditionally, banitsa is made with homemade or commercially made pastry sheets that are prepared from a baker's hard dough made of flour, water, and salt. At home the sheets can be spread by continuously pulling the sheet of dough with one's fingers until it becomes less than a millimeter thin, or by using a rolling pin in several stages with sunflower oil  sprinkled between the partially spread leaves, or by a very difficult technique comprising waving movements of the entire sheet over the head of the cook, which resembles pizza dough making techniques. Commercially available sheets are mechanically spread and somewhat dried before packing.\nAnother sort of banitsa is called tutmanik (\u0442\u0443\u0442\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a) or poparnik (\u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a) and is made with leavened sheets. The usual filling is cheese.\nThe traditional filling is made of crushed white cheese (sirene, feta cheese), yogurt, and eggs. Sometimes baking soda is added to the yogurt, which makes it rise (as the baking soda reacts with the acid in yogurt). The addition of baking soda results in a fluffier filling.\nVegetable fillings include spinach, sorrel, docks, mangold, chards, beet leaves, nettles, leaves of the radishes, leeks, onions and green part of spring onions, parsley, cabbage or sauerkraut. All these variants, including cabbage, are called zelnik (\u0437\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043a), from the word \u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d (zelen) 'green'. The leek variant is called praznik (\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a) and onion variant is called luchnik (\u043b\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a).\nIn some regions of Bulgaria, the filling is made with rice. There are also meat fillings with minced meat, onions, and mushrooms. Sweet fillings with apples (similar to apple pie or strudel) or pumpkin with sugar, walnuts and cinnamon exist as well. In some regions, only the walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon are used. The apple variant is called shtrudel (\u0449\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043b), and the pumpkin variant is tikvenik (\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a).\nModern take on Banitsa with milk is made by baking the leaves soaked in milk with sugar, eggs and vanilla.\nIn Bulgaria, banitsa is a symbol of Bulgarian cuisine and traditions.\nTraditionally, Bulgarians prepare and serve banitsa on two holidays\u00a0\u2013 Christmas and New Year's Eve. On these days, people add kusmeti (literally lucks, meaning fortunes, lucky charms) into the banitsa. The charms are usually small pieces of dogwood branch, which vary in numbers of buds on them. They symbolize health and longevity. The branches are hidden inside the banitsa, and the banitsa is then baked. When ready, the banitsa is cut to as many pieces as the members of the family are and each piece contains a dogwood branch. Two additional pieces of banitsa are cut - one for the house and another one for Virgin Mary who is the protector of the family. A wish is associated with each branch and the different number of buds on the branch helps to recognize the corresponding wish. The wishes include happiness, health, success, travel, etc. The banitsa is then spun on the table and everyone takes the piece which is in front of them when the spinning stops. Then they find their fortune inside the piece\u00a0\u2013 the fortunes predict what one is to expect from the new year. The most common fortunes are \"health\", \"love\", \"marriage\", \"baby\", \"journey\", \"wealth\", etc.\nAlternatively or in addition to the kusmeti, some add a coin or simply little pieces of paper with written fortunes on them (just like the ones in the fortune cookies). In this case, they are wrapped in tin foil to preserve them during baking.\nThe word \"banitsa\" is used",

The name wanko comes from the regional dialect of the Iwate Prefecture from which it comes, meaning \"bowl\", but more specifically, a small, wooden Japanese soup bowl.  There are many theories about the origin of the dish itself however.\nOne such origin is of a landowner who was having a festival on his land.  There was a crowd of over 100 villagers and guests who customarily ate soba at festivals. However, there were so many people to feed but the pots in which the soba were to be made were very small. The soba noodles were spread around in reduced quantities so that there would be enough for everyone.\nNanbu Toshinao, a territorial lord of the Nanbu area, came and stopped at a house in Hanamaki asking for a meal.  His retainers served him a local variety of soba in a small soup bowl.  Thinking they served Nanbu Toshinao something too rustic and without much flavor, they were afraid of his reaction.  But Nanbu Toshinao thought it was delicious, and ordered more servings.  This is said to have established the tradition of hosts continuing to serve small bowls until their guest was satisfied.\nThere are many stories of how the dish came to be, but these two are the most common. However, as the term \"wanko\" did not come about until after World War II, some repudiate the stories.\nIn December 1957, the Hanamaki-shi Cultural Centre was the site of the first annual contest on who could eat the most bowls of wanko soba. The event continues to this day featuring noodle fans from many countries.\nWanko Soba is one of the Three Great Noodles of Morioka (\u76db\u5ca1\u4e09\u5927\u9eba) along with Morioka Reimen (\u76db\u5ca1\u51b7\u9eba) and Morioka Jajamen (\u76db\u5ca1\u3058\u3083\u3058\u3083\u9eba)\nPerry, Julien. \"Competitive Eating\".

An all-dressed hot dog typically does not include ketchup, which must be requested specifically.</ref>\nMichigan hot dog: This hot dog is topped with meat chili sauce or spaghetti sauce.

                "description": "A Chicago-style hot dog, Chicago Dog, or Chicago Red Hot is an all-beef frankfurter on a poppy seed bun, originating from the city of Chicago, Illinois. The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, bright green sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices or wedges, pickled sport peppers and a dash of celery salt. The complete assembly of a Chicago hot dog is said to be \"dragged through the garden\" due to the many toppings. The method for cooking the hot dog itself varies depending on the vendor's preference. Most often they are steamed, water-simmered, or less often grilled over charcoal (in which case they are referred to as \"char-dogs\"). ...",

The hot dog arrived in Chicago through Frankfurt from Vienna. Pork sausages have been known in Frankfurt since the 13th century. Sometime in the 19th century a butcher in Vienna added beef to the sausage mixture. He called this a \"wiener-frankfurter\". Eventually reaching Chicago, Franks served in buns became popular at fairs and baseball games. Reportedly the pork-free and kosher-style all beef frank was originated by Fluky's in 1929. During the Great Depression they were sold for a nickel out of carts along Maxwell Street. Two Austrian Hungarian immigrants sold their Vienna Beef franks at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.  Vienna Beef became a major producer of hot dogs and by the early 2000s was one of the major suppliers for hot dog carts.\nThe \"dragged through the garden\" style is heavily promoted by Vienna Beef and Red Hot Chicago, the two most prominent Chicago hot dog manufacturers, but exceptions are common, with vendors adding  cucumber slices or lettuce, omitting poppyseeds or celery salt, or using plain relish or a skinless hot dog. Several popular hot dog stands serve a simpler version known as the \"Depression Dog\": a steamed natural-casing dog with only mustard, onions, plain relish and sport peppers, wrapped up with hand-cut french fries, while the historic Superdawg drive-ins notably substitute a pickled tomato for fresh.  Many vendors offer a Chicago-style dog with cheese sauce, known as a cheese-dog. Boz Hot Dogs locations offer a unique nacho cheese sauce with pieces of jalape\u00f1o peppers.\nChicago-style hot dogs are cooked in hot water or steamed before adding the toppings. A less common style is cooked on a charcoal grill and referred to as a \"char-dog\". Char-dogs are easily identifiable because very often the ends of the dog are sliced in crisscross fashion before cooking, producing a distinctive cervelat-style \"curled-x\" shape as the dog cooks. Some hot dog stands, such as the Wieners Circle, only serve char-dogs.\nThe typical beef hot dog weighs 1/8 of a pound or 2 ounces (57\u00a0g) and the most traditional type features a natural casing, providing a distinctive \"snap\" when bitten.\nThe buns are a high-gluten variety made to hold up to steam warming, typically the S. Rosen's Mary Ann brand from Alpha Baking Company.\nThe Chicago area has more hot dog restaurants than McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King restaurants combined. A \"hot dog stand\" in Chicago may serve many other items, including the Maxwell Street Polish, gyros, pork chop and Italian beef sandwiches, corn dogs, tamales, pizza puffs and Italian ice. The restaurants often have unique names or architectural features.\nFluky's\nGene & Jude's\nHot Doug's\nPortillo's\nSuperdawg\nThe Wieners Circle\nWoody's Chicago Style\nChicago-style pizza\nCuisine of Chicago\nFrancheezie\nHot dog variations\nItalian Beef\nList of hot dogs\nMaxwell Street Polish\nZeldes, Leah A.

The potatoes are cut into thin strips and layered in a roasting tin, alternating with the sprats and chopped onions in between. Salt and pepper is put over each layer, then cream is added so that it almost fills the tin. It is finally baked in an oven at 200\u00a0\u00b0C (392\u00a0\u00b0F) for about one hour.\nThe recipe is often mistranslated into English, with anchovies being substituted for sprats. This is because sprats (Sprattus sprattus) pickled in sugar, salt and spices have been known in Sweden as ansjovis since the middle of the 19th century, while true anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus) are sold in Sweden as sardeller (sardelles). Also, small herrings (Clupea harengus) may be used instead of sprats.\nIt has often been associated with the opera singer Per Adolf \"Pelle\" Janzon (1844\u20131889), remembered as a gourmand. However, another claim for the origin of the name has been made by Gunnar Stigmark (1910\u20132001) in an article, \"S\u00e5 var det med Janssons frestelse\", which appeared in the periodical Gastronomisk kalender. According to Stigmark, the name was borrowed from the film Janssons frestelse (1928) featuring the film actor and director Edvin Adolphson; as a name for this dish, it was coined by Stigmark's mother and her hired female chef for the particular occasion of a society dinner, whence it spread to other households and eventually into cookbooks.\nList of casserole dishes\nWebb, Loios Sinaiko.

Kwetiau with beef is known in three variants; kwetiau siram sapi (poured upon), kwetiau goreng sapi (stir fried), and kwetiau bun sapi (a rather moist version). The kwetiau siram sapi is a kwetiau noodle poured (Indonesian: siram) with beef in thick flavorful sauce. The beef sauce has thick and rather gloppy glue-like consistency acquired from corn starch as thickening agent. The kwetiau goreng sapi is a variant of popular kwetiau goreng (stir fried kway teow) but distinctly served with beef. While the kwetiau bun sapi is similar to common fried kwetiau but rather moist and soft due to water addition.\nThe common ingredients are flat rice noodles (kwetiau), thin slices of beef tenderloin, garlic, sliced bakso meatballs, caisim, napa cabbage, oyster sauce, beef stock, soy sauce, black pepper, sugar, corn starch, and cooking oil.\nIn Singapore, traditionally, beef extract was added to the stock, and the soup enhanced with gula melaka and lengkuas (galangal or blue ginger). However, the dry version of beef kway teow is mixed with sesame oil, soy sauce and chilli; thick gravy is not usually served in this version.\nKwetiau goreng\nChar kway teow\nBeef chow fun\nChinese Indonesian cuisine\n\"Siapa Tak Kenal Kwetiau Sapi Mabes?\".

                "description": "Pease pudding, also known as pease porridge, is a savoury pudding dish made of boiled legumes, typically split yellow peas, with water, salt and spices, and often cooked with a bacon or ham joint. A common dish in the north-east of England, it is consumed to a lesser extent in the rest of Britain, as well as in other regions worldwide.",

Pease pudding is typically thick, somewhat similar in texture to (but perhaps a little more solid than) hummus, and is light yellow in colour, with a mild taste. Pease pudding is traditionally produced in England, especially in the industrial North Eastern areas including South Shields. It is often served with ham or bacon, beetroot and stottie cakes. It is also a key ingredient in the classic saveloy dip. In Southern England, it is usually served with faggots. Also in southern England is the small village of Pease Pottage which, according to tradition, gets its name from serving pease pottage to convicts either on their way from London to the South Coast, or from East Grinstead to Horsham.\nPeasemeal brose, also known as brosemeal, is a traditional breakfast dish in the north of Scotland. It is made in the traditional way and usually eaten with butter, and either salt or honey.\nIn parts of the Midlands, it replaces mushy peas as a traditional accompaniment to fish and chips, although the distinction is largely the name and tendency for mushy peas to be green. In both cases, the starchy \"field peas\" used are harvested dry, as opposed to \"sweet peas\", which are the same species harvested fresh.\nIn Middle English, 'pease' was a mass noun, used in the same way as 'flour' or 'oatmeal'. The modern singular 'pea' and its plural 'peas' derive from this.\nThe dish is a traditional part of Jiggs dinner in Newfoundland, Canada.\nIn German-speaking countries, pease pudding is known under the name Erbsp\u00fcree or Erbsenp\u00fcree. Alternative regional names are Erbsbrei or Erbsmus. It is especially widespread in the traditional cuisine of the German capital Berlin. The best-known German dish which is traditionally served with pease pudding is Eisbein. A similar dish with ham hock, karka, is served in Lithuania. \nTraditional Russian cuisine has several pea-based dishes, including pease pudding/puree/soups known as gorohovaya kasha (Russian: \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0448\u0430) or goroshnitsa (Russian: \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430).\nIn Beijing cuisine, wandouhuang (\u8c4c\u8c46\u9ec4) is a sweetened and chilled pease pudding made with yellow split peas or shelled mung beans, sometimes flavoured with sweet osmanthus blossoms and dates. A refined version of this snack is said to have been a favourite of Empress Dowager Cixi.\nIn Greek cuisine, a similar dish is called fava (\u03a6\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1). Despite the name, it is usually made from yellow split peas, not broad beans. The mashed peas are usually drizzled with olive oil and topped with chopped raw onions.\nGenerally, recipes for pease pudding involve steeping soaked split yellow peas in stock (traditionally ham hock stock) and cooking them for around 40 minutes. The resulting mush is then blended with other ingredients, which depend on the variation. The oldest known written recipe for something similar to pease pudding involves saffron, nutmeg and a little cinnamon in the blending process; modern recipes sometimes beat in an egg at this point to act as an extra binding agent.\nPease pudding is featured in a nursery rhyme, \"Pease Porridge Hot\".\nThe song \"Food, Glorious Food\" from the 1960s West End and Broadway musical (and 1968 film) Oliver! has a lyric extolling pease pudding. \nIn The Princess and the Goblin, Curdie takes bread and pease pudding with him for sustenance when he goes to spy on the King's house.\nA discussion on pease pudding features in the first episode of the BBC TV soap opera EastEnders.\nPease pudding also featured in Geordie Shore season 16 episode 10 as the cast members handed out leaflets and samples promoting the product.\nDaal\nFul medames\nHummus\nList of porridges\nPea soup\nMushy peas\nPorridge\nPottage\nRoundell, Mrs Charles (1898).

The pressure created by the carbonated liquid seals the bottle by forcing a glass marble up into the neck of the bottle where it snugly locks into a rubber gasket. Opening the bottle by pressing on the marble thus releasing the pressurised gas is seen to be a fun experience. The drink is easily available at street-sellers, known as bantawallahs, at prices ranging from 5 (6.6US) - 30 (40US). The drink is sold in glass tumblers and plastic cups, and used to be served in kulhars (traditional small earthen pots). ...",

The marbel in hindi and punjabi is known as the banta, goli, goti, kancha, etc. Hence the names, Banta Soda  and Goti Soda - as the drink is known in North India, and the Goli Soda - as the drink is known in South India. In Delhi, it is also called the kanchay waali drink or nimbu soda. Fotash Jawl is the Bengali name for this drink.\nThe Codd-neck bottle, named after its inventor Hiram Codd who patented it in 1872, was specially designed for the lemonade and fizzy beverages. Bottles, which then became popular throughout the British colonial empire and now cherished as the collector items, are still in production and use in India for banta and in Japan for Ramune. Until 1900s, before the manufacturing of these bottles started in India, the bottles were imported from Britain. Prior to India's independence in 1947, the bottles were banned in several cities during the Indian independence movement as the Indian freedom fighters use to add chuna (calcium hydroxide) to the soda bottles for making improvised mini cannons.\nIn 1950s, banta soda was sold on horse-drawn carts which also carried the soda-making equipment.\nIngredients, such as salt and water, are mixed with the flavours using either the fresh fruit juice or commercial flavours, which is then poured into a Codd-neck bottle using a funnel till the bottle is full. The bottle is placed into soda-making machine, which grips the bottle firmly in a container, and a nozzle from the machine snugly closes the mouth of the bottle and infuses it with the carbon dioxide, after which the container which holds the bottle is rotated 2 or 3 times to further diffuse the carbon dioxide which pushes the marble up the neck of bottle against the gasket at the top, thus sealing the bottle. Bottles are reusable, which are collected by the bottlers, cleaned, washed, steamed or sanitised, and rebottled.\nLike Ramune, a drink available in Japan, Banta Soda in India is also available in a Codd-neck bottle, a heavy glass bottle whose mouth is sealed by a round marble (instead of a cap) thanks to the pressure of the carbonated contents. The distinctive bottle has led to the drink also being called goli soda in South India.\nPrior to India's independence the Codd-neck bottles were imported from England. However, post-independence local manufacturers came up, including many factories in Ahmedabad, all of which have now stopped making Codd-neck bottles. Presently, Khandelwal Glass Works, who has been making these bottles since 1981 at Sasni in Uttar Pradesh, is the sole manufacturer of Codd-neck bottle in India after their competitor Mahalakshmi Glass Works in Hyderabad closed down a few years ago. Before the re-entry of popular soft drinks, like Pepsi and Coca-Cola in 1993, the sale of Banta reached its peak in the early 1990s, selling 100,000 bags per annum, with each bag containing 75 bottles. By 2010, however, the sales had dropped by nearly half.\nDuring the bottling process, a chemical flavouring agent known as Lemon No. 1 by International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF) is added. The agent is also used in ice cream and by the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe banta soda bottles are largely bottled by unorganized manufacturers, who sell bottles for as little as \u20b92 (2.7\u00a2\u00a0US). In 2017, Delhi had over 100 single-room bottling units. In 1970s, Chennai had 150 goli soda bottling units in the unorganised sector which had dropped to 50 by 2018.\nChennai-based Kozzmo Beverages, which started its operations in 2018, has started making commercial pre-packaged hygienic goli soda using a manufacturing unit certified by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). It sells 6 flavours \u2014 paneer soda, nimbu masala, lemon, orange, grape, and pineapple.\nRamune\nShikanjvi\nList of Indian drinks\n\nNote-1.Based on supply data of India's sole Codd-neck bottles manufacturers.\nAnuja & Krish Raghav (2 July 2010). \"Pop culture\".

There is a variety of ways it is prepared and served. Its simplest form is in a hot soup as kake udon with a mild broth called kakejiru made from dashi, soy sauce, and mirin. It is usually topped with thinly chopped scallions. Other common toppings include prawn tempura, kakiage (mixed tempura fritter), abura-age (sweet, deep-fried tofu pouches), kamaboko (sliced fish cake), and shichimi spice added to taste. Standard broth differs by region. Dark (koikuchi) soy sauce is added in eastern Japan, while light (usukuchi) soy sauce is added in the west.

There are many stories explaining the origin of udon.\nOne story says that in AD 1241, Enni, a Rinzai monk, introduced flour milling technology from Song China to Japan. Floured crops were then made into noodles such as udon, soba, and pancakes in Japan which were eaten by locals. Milling techniques were spread around the country.\nAnother story states that during the Nara period, a Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China was introduced to 14 different kinds of food. One of them was called sakubei (\u7d22\u9905), which was listed as muginawa (\u725f\u7fa9\u7e04) in Shinsen Jiky\u014d (\u65b0\u64b0\u5b57\u93e1), a dictionary which was published in the Heian Era. The muginawa is believed to be an origin for many kinds of Japanese noodles. However, the muginawa in Shinsen Jiky\u014d was made with wheat and rice flour.\nAnother story for udon claims that the original name of the noodle was konton, which was made with wheat flour and sweet fillings. Yet another story says that a Buddhist priest called K\u016bkai introduced udon noodles to Shikoku during the Heian Era. K\u016bkai, the Buddhist priest, traveled to Tang Dynasty China around the beginning of the 9th century to study. Sanuki Province claimed to have been the first to adopt udon noodles from K\u016bkai. Hakata province claimed to have produced udon noodles based on Enni's recipe.\nUdon noodles are boiled in a pot of hot water. Depending on the type of udon, the way it is served is different as well. Udon noodles are usually served chilled in the summer and hot in the winter. In the Edo period, the thicker wheat noodle was generally called udon, and served with a hot broth called nurumugi (\u6e29\u9ea6). The chilled variety was called hiyamugi (\u51b7\u9ea6).\nCold udon, or udon salad, is usually mixed with egg omelette slices, shredded chicken and fresh vegetables, such as cucumber and radish. Toppings of udon soup are chosen to reflect the seasons. Most toppings are added without much cooking, although deep-fried tempura is sometimes added. Many of these dishes may also be prepared with soba.\nChikara udon: (\"power udon\"): topped with toasted mochi rice cakes.\nGoboten udon: with deep-fried shredded burdock root\nHaikara udon: (\"modern udon\"): see tanuki udon. From \u30cf\u30a4\u30ab\u30e9\nKake udon (in the Kant\u014d region) or su udon (in Kansai): hot udon in broth topped with thinly sliced green onions, and perhaps a slice of kamaboko.\nKamaage udon: served in a communal hot-pot with hot water, and accompanied by a hot dipping sauce of dashi sukiyaki.\nKar\u0113 nanban or kar\u0113 udon (\"curry udon\"): modern udon served in a spicy curry-flavoured broth, which may also include meat or vegetables. The term nanban is a reference to the Nanban trade which had influenced Japanese culture for a century before being banned in 1639 by the Edo Shogunate. Biei, Hokkaido is famous for a unique curry udon.\nKitsune udon: (\"fox udon\"): topped with aburaage (sweet, deep-fried tofu pouches). The dish is called \"fox\" because of its association with aburaage. Originated in Osaka. Kitsune udon is often mistaken for Tanuki udon.\nMaruten udon: topped with maruten, deep-fried large fish cake\nNabeyaki udon: a sort of udon hot-pot, with seafood and vegetables cooked in a nabe, or metal pot. The most common ingredients are tempura shrimp with mushrooms and an egg cracked on top.\nOboro udon: dashi broth with kombu flakes.\nOyako udon: chicken and egg, with sliced onion in a sweetened dashi soup over udon.

The balls are brushed with takoyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce) and mayonnaise, and then sprinkled with green laver (aonori) and shavings of dried bonito (katsuobushi).

Takoyaki was first popularized in Osaka, where a street vendor named Tomekichi Endo is credited with its invention in 1935. Takoyaki was inspired by akashiyaki, a small round dumpling from the city of Akashi in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture made of an egg-rich batter and octopus. Takoyaki was initially popular in the Kansai region, and later spread to the Kant\u014d region and other areas of Japan. Takoyaki is associated with yatai street food stalls, and there are many well-established takoyaki specialty restaurants, particularly in the Kansai region. Takoyaki is now sold at commercial outlets, such as supermarkets and 24-hour convenience stores.\nIt is also very popular in Taiwanese cuisine due to the historical influence of Japanese culture.\nThe oldest known takoyaki store is Aizuya in Osaka. Founded by Tomakichi Endo, it has been open since the 1930s. The first takoyaki included beef and konjac, but later Endo switched to using the now traditional octopus and added flavor to the batter. The takoyaki are then eaten with brown sauce, similar to Worcestershire sauce. The food, known as \"octopus balls\", quickly became popular throughout Japan.\nA takoyaki pan (\u305f\u3053\u713c\u304d\u5668, takoyaki-ki) or\u2014much more rarely\u2014takoyaki-nabe (\u305f\u3053\u713c\u304d\u934b) is typically a griddle made of cast iron with hemispherical molds. The heavy iron evenly heats the takoyaki, which are turned with a pick during the heating process to pull the uncooked batter to the base of the rounded cavity. Commercial gas-fueled takoyaki cookers are used at Japanese festivals or by street vendors. For home use, electric versions resemble a hotplate; stovetop versions are also available.\nA children's book named Takoyaki Mantoman published in the 1990s and later adapted into an anime television series produced by Studio Pierrot that aired from April 1998 to September 1999.\nTakoyaki was featured on the Netflix Television series, Street Food, in the Osaka, Japan episode.\n\nList of seafood dishes\nSimilar global dishes\n\u00c6bleskiver in Denmark\nCekodok in Malaysia\nPoffertjes in Netherlands\nKue cucur in Indonesia\nUnniyappam and neyyappam (both sweet dishes) and paddu (plain or spicy but vegan) in India\n\"\u86f8\u713c\" [Takoyaki].

The muginawa is believed to be an origin for many kinds of Japanese noodles. However, the muginawa in Shinsen Jiky\u014d was made with wheat and rice flour.\nAnother story for udon claims that the original name of the noodle was konton, which was made with wheat flour and sweet fillings. Yet another story says that a Buddhist priest called K\u016bkai introduced udon noodles to Shikoku during the Heian Era. K\u016bkai, the Buddhist priest, traveled to Tang Dynasty China around the beginning of the 9th century to study. Sanuki Province claimed to have been the first to adopt udon noodles from K\u016bkai. Hakata province claimed to have produced udon noodles based on Enni's recipe.\nUdon noodles are boiled in a pot of hot water. Depending on the type of udon, the way it is served is different as well. Udon noodles are usually served chilled in the summer and hot in the winter. In the Edo period, the thicker wheat noodle was generally called udon, and served with a hot broth called nurumugi (\u6e29\u9ea6). The chilled variety was called hiyamugi (\u51b7\u9ea6).\nCold udon, or udon salad, is usually mixed with egg omelette slices, shredded chicken and fresh vegetables, such as cucumber and radish.

Nomenclature of Chinese noodles can be difficult due to the vast spectrum available in China and the many dialects of Chinese used to name them. In Mandarin, mi\u00e0n (simplified Chinese: \u9762; traditional Chinese: \u9eb5; often transliterated as \"mien\" or \"mein\" ) refers to noodles made from wheat flour, while f\u011bn (\u7c89) or \"fun\" refers to noodles made from other starches, particularly rice flour and mung bean starch. Each noodle type can be rendered in pinyin for Mandarin, but in Hong Kong and neighboring Guangdong it will be known by its Cantonese pronunciation (\"meen\" or \"mien\" for wheat noodles, \"fun\" for non-wheat). Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and many other Overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia may use Hokkien (Min Nan) instead (e.g. \"mee\" for wheat noodles).\nThe earliest written record of noodles is from a book dated to the Eastern Han period (25\u2013220 CE). Noodles, often made from wheat dough, became a prominent staple of food during the Han dynasty. In the Western Han Dynasty, due to the demand for military, it was necessary for the Government to implement food processing technologies that would make the food storage easier and more affordable. During this time, \u201cLaomian\u201d emerged, it was made with starch rich buckwheat, millet and pea flours with lower water content, making it easier to store and transport.\nDuring the Song dynasty (960\u20131279) noodle shops were very popular in the cities, and remained open all night. During the earlier dynastic periods Chinese wheat noodles were known as \"soup cake\" (Chinese: \u6e6f\u9905; pinyin: t\u0101ng b\u01d0ng), as explained by the Song dynasty scholar Hu\u00e1ng Ch\u00e1o Y\u012bng (\u9ec3\u671d\u82f1) mentions in his work \"A delightful mixed discussion on various scholarly topics\" (Chinese: \u9756\u5eb7\u7dd7\u7d20\u96dc\u8a18; pinyin: j\u00ecngk\u0101ngxi\u0101ngs\u00f9z\u00e1j\u00ec, Scroll 2) that in ancient times bready foods like pasta are referred collectively as \"bing\" and differentiated through their cooking methods.\u00b7\nUp until 1992, most dried Chinese noodles in the United States could not be sold labelled as \"noodles\". This is due to fact that many Chinese noodles are made without eggs and do not always use wheat as starch, thus resulting in the United States Department of Agriculture obliging manufacturers to label them as \"imitation noodles\" or \"alimentary paste\".\nChinese noodles are generally made from either wheat flour, rice flour, or mung bean starch, with wheat noodles being more commonly produced and consumed in northern China and rice noodles being more typical of southern China. Egg, lye, and cereal may also be added to noodles made from wheat flour in order to give the noodles a different color or flavor. Egg whites, arrowroot or tapioca starch are sometimes added to the flour mixture in low quantities to change the texture and tenderness of the noodles' strands. Although illegal, the practice of adding the chemical cross-linker borax to whiten noodles and improve their texture is also quite common in East Asia. In general, the Chinese noodles cooking method involves making a dough with flour, salt, and water; mixing the dough by hand to form bar shapes; bending the bars for proofing; pulling the bars into strips; dropping the strips into a pot with boiling water; and removing the noodles when finished cooking. Chinese type noodles are generally made from hard wheat flours, characterized by bright creamy white or bright yellow color and firm texture. \nBefore the automatic noodle machine was invented in 1950s, the processing of Chinese noodles were made with four steps, including:\nFresh \u2013 The noodles are often consumed within 24 hours of manufacture due to quick discoloration. Their shelf life can be extended to 3\u20135 days if stored under refrigeration;\nDried \u2013 Fresh noodle strands are dried by sunlight or in a controlled chamber;\nBoiled \u2013 Fresh noodle strands are either parboiled or fully cooked. After parboiling, Chinese noodles are rinsed in cold water, drained and covered with 1\u20132% vegetable oil to prevent sticking;\nSteamed \u2013 Fresh alkaline noodle strands are steamed in a steamer and softened with water through rinsing.\nThe dough for noodles made from wheat flour is typically made from wheat flour, salt, and water, with the addition of eggs or lye depending on the desired texture and taste of the noodles. Rice- or other starch-based noodles are typically made with only the starch or rice flour and water. After the formation of a pliable dough mass, one of five types of mechanical processing may be applied to produce the noodles:\nWhile cut and extruded noodles can be dried to create a shelf-stable product to be eaten months after production, most peeled, pulled and kneaded noodles are consumed shortly after they are produced.\nNoodles may be cooked from either their fresh (moist) or dry forms. They are generally boiled, although they may also be deep-fried in oil until",

In English, cannoli is usually  used as a singular, but in Italian, it is grammatically plural; the corresponding singular is cannolo (Italian:\u00a0[kan\u02c8n\u0254\u02d0lo]; Sicilian: cannolu [kan\u02c8n\u0254\u02d0l\u028a]), a diminutive meaning 'little tube', from canna, 'cane' or 'tube'. This form is uncommon in English.\nSome food historians place the origins of cannoli in 827\u20131091\u00a0AD  in Caltanissetta, by the concubines of princes looking to capture their attention. \nAuthor Gaetano Basile merged this legend with other historical traditions to determine that cannoli come from the Palermo and Messina areas and were historically prepared as a treat during Carnival season, possibly as a fertility symbol. The dessert eventually became a year-round staple in Sicily.\nSome similar desserts in Middle Eastern tradition include \"Zaynab's fingers\" (\u0623\u0635\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u0632\u064a\u0646\u0628), which are filled with nuts, and qanaw\u0101t (\u0642\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062a), deep-fried dough tubes filled with various sweets, which were a popular pastry across the ancient Islamic world. The dish and the name may originate from the Muslim Emirate of Sicily. The minne di Sant'Agata or minni di virgini, cheese filled half spheres with icing and fruit are shaped like a breast in honour of St Agatha. Feddi d\u00fb cancillieri (\"chancellor's slices\") are similar cream and apricot jam filled almond cookies designed to look like the rear of a person.\nRicotta\nHyblean ricotta\nGangi, Robert (2006). \"Cannoli\". bestofsicily.com.

Frito pie is a dish popular in the Midwestern and Southwestern United States, whose basic ingredients are chili, cheese, and corn chips (traditionally Fritos). Additions can include salsa, refried beans, sour cream, onion, rice, or jalape\u00f1os. There are many variations and alternative names used by region. Frito pie can be prepared in a casserole dish, but an alternate preparation can be in a single-serve Fritos-type corn chip bag with various ingredients as toppings. In Mexico a similar type of dish is chilaquiles.\nThe exact origin of the frito pie is not completely clear. It is believed that it was created somewhere in Mexico and was popular at fiestas before it took off in other countries like the United States.\nThe oldest known recipe using Fritos brand corn chips with chili was published in Texas in 1949. The recipe may have been invented by Daisy Doolin, the mother of the founder of the Frito Corporation (Doolin) and the first person to use Fritos as an ingredient in cooking, or by Mary Livingston, Doolin's executive secretary. The Frito-Lay company attributes the recipe to Nell Morris, who joined Frito-Lay in the 1950s and helped develop an official cookbook which included the Frito pie.\nDoolin and his Frito Corporation were early investors in Disneyland, which opened Casa de Fritos restaurant in Disneyland in 1955. \"Frito Chili Pie\" appears on the 1950s menu. \nAnother story claims that true Frito pie originated only in the 1960s with Teresa Hern\u00e1ndez, who worked at the F. W. Woolworth's lunch counter in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Her Frito pie used homemade red chile con carne with cheddar cheese and onions, and was served in the bag, which was thicker in the 1960s than it is now.\n\nFrito Pies are sometimes referred to by the name walking taco or Frito boat, and can be made in a small, single-serving bag of corn chips, with chili, taco meat, chickpeas, pork rinds, pepitas, and many other varied ingredients, poured over the top. The combination can be finished with grated cheese, onions, jalape\u00f1os, lettuce, and sour cream, known as a Frito boat or walking taco in the Midwestern United States. In the Ohio Valley region, this preparation is commonly called taco-in-a-bag. (\"Walking taco\" or \"traveling taco\", however, is the more widespread term at least in the Midwest). In many parts of Southern California, they are known as \"pepper bellies.\" Frito pies are popular at sports venues, fundraisers, bingos, open houses, state fairs, and street vendors. The term Tostiloco comes from Tijuana, and is found in California. Another term is Doriloco, after Doritos.\nIn Mexico, a version of the dish is known as tostilocos (\"crazy chips\"). It is topped with cueritos, cucumber, j\u00edcama, lime juice, Valentina hot sauce, chamoy, Taj\u00edn chili powder, salt, and \"Japanese peanuts\".\nHaystacks\nTaco salad\nTamale pie\nTostilocos\nPetro's Chili & Chips, a Knoxville, Tennessee-based fast food chain serving a frito pie variant first served at the 1982 World's Fair.\nHarris, Joyce (13 June 2007). \"The allure of Frito Pie\".

Almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, and chocolate and sometimes raisins are threaded onto a string, dipped in thickened grape juice or fruit juices and dried in the shape of a sausage. The traditional technology of churchkhela in the Kakheti region was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2015.\nChurchkhela and its varieties are popular in several countries besides Georgia, such as Syria \"Aleppo\" as known as zob alkadi \u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0636\u064a, Iran, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Cyprus, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Pakistan and Turkey.

In Armenian, Greek, and Turkish it is known as \"sujuk\", which is actually a dry sausage. To distinguish the two, it is sometimes referred to as \"sweet sujukh\" (\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0581\u0580 \u057d\u0578\u0582\u057b\u0578\u0582\u056d, kaghtsr sujukh) in Armenian and cevizli sucuk (\"walnut sujuk\") in Turkish.

A variant of Churchkhela, traditionally called Kelawo, is prepared in the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan. It was locally marketed as Hunza chocolate, but as Kelawo does not contain any cocoa, it is now renamed as Hunza Candy.\nThe Cypriot variety is made by dipping strings of almonds into jelly, called palouzes (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03ad\u03c2).\nChurchkhela is a between-meals snack and is also served as a dessert during New Year and Christmas celebrations.\nTraditionally, in times of war women would send their men Churchkhela to eat at the front, because of its pragmatic size, ability not to mold for long periods of time, and heavy texture that keeps one full.\n\nGozinaki\nList of grape dishes\nPestil\nGoldstein, Darra (1999).

Ashure or Noah's pudding is a dessert porridge that is made of a mixture consisting of grains, fruits, dried fruits and nuts. \nIn the Balkans and Turkey Sufi Muslims make the dish during the month of Muharram in which the Day of Ashure takes place. Traditionally, ashure is made in large quantities to commemorate the ark's landing and is distributed to friends, relatives, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, and others, without regard to the recipient's religion or belief system as an offering of peace and love. Ashure was traditionally made and eaten during the colder months of the year due to its heavy and calorie rich nature, but now it is enjoyed year-round. Armenians make it as a Christmas pudding and for New Year's celebrations, where it is a centerpiece.\nIn anecdotal history, it is claimed that when Noah's Ark came to rest on Mount Ararat, Noah's family celebrated with a special dish. Since their supplies were nearly exhausted, what was left (primarily grains, dried fruits and the like) was cooked together to form a pudding, what is now called ashure. \nTurkish families make ashure pudding to commemorate this event. Among Turkish and Bosnian Sufis (especially Bektashi), the ashure pudding is prepared with special prayers for health, healing, safety, success and spiritual nourishment. Ashure is distributed to the poor, as well as to neighbors, friends and relatives.\nEvliya \u00c7elebi says in his travelbook Seyahatname that \"Ashure is a porridge (a\u015f) that should be cooked at the tenth of Muharram.\"\nIn Armenia, ashure may be garnished with pomegranate seeds and flavored with rose water, and the pudding is shared with neighbors during the Christmas season. The festive pudding is the centerpiece of the New Year's table, which is often decorated with dried fruits, nuts and pomegranates.\nThe word Ashure comes from the Arabic word Ashura Arabic: \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0621\u200e \u02bb\u0100sh\u016br\u0101\u2019\u00a0, meaning 'tenth'. In Turkish tradition, this dish is made mostly on 10th of Muharram or after 10th of Muharram in Islamic Lunar Calendar. The association with Muharram is not only significant in Islamic beliefs, but also pre-Islamic beliefs, with some Semitic stories also referencing this month.\nAlso in Turkish, Ash(A\u015f) represents mixed porridge. It is derived from Persian word \"Ashur\" meaning mixing.\nAshoriya, grains and cereals are eaten in remembrance for the drowned people of Noah's flood in Mandaeism\nFieldhouse, P. (2017).

Shortbread or shortie is a traditional Scottish biscuit usually made from one part white sugar, two parts butter, and three to four parts plain wheat flour. Unlike many other biscuits and baked goods, shortbread does not contain any leavening, such as baking powder or baking soda. Shortbread is widely associated with Christmas and Hogmanay festivities in Scotland, and some Scottish brands are exported around the world.\nShortbread originated in Scotland. Although it was prepared during much of the 12th century, and probably benefited from cultural exchange with French pastry chefs during the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland, the refinement of shortbread is popularly credited to Mary, Queen of Scots in the 16th century. This type of shortbread was baked, cut into triangular wedges, and flavored with caraway seeds.\nThe first printed recipe, in 1736, was from a Scotswoman named Mrs McLintock.\nShortbread was expensive and reserved as a luxury for special occasions such as Christmas, Hogmanay (Scottish New Year\u2019s Eve), and weddings.  In Scotland, it was traditional to break a decorated shortbread cake (infar-cake or dreaming bread) over the head of a new bride on the entrance of her new house.  Shortbread was also given as a gift.\nShortbread is so named because of its crumbly texture (from an old meaning of the word \"short\", as opposed to \"long\", or stretchy). The cause of this texture is its high fat content, provided by the butter. The short or crumbly texture is a result of the fat inhibiting the formation of long protein (gluten) strands.  The related word \"shortening\" refers to any fat that may be added to produce a \"short\" (crumbly) texture.\nIn British English, shortbread and shortcake were synonyms for several centuries, starting in the 1400s; both referred to the crisp, crumbly cookie-type baked good, rather than a softer cake.  The \"short-cake\" mentioned in Shakespeare's play The Merry Wives of Windsor, first published in 1602, was a reference to the cookie-style of shortbread.\nIn American English, shortbread is different from shortcake.  Shortcake usually has a chemical leavening agent such as baking powder, which gives it a different, softer texture, and it was normally split and filled with fruit.  The most popular example of this difference is strawberry shortcake.\nShortbread is commonly formed into one of three shapes: \none large circle, which is divided into segments as soon as it is taken out of the oven (petticoat tails, which may have been named from the French petits cot\u00e9s, a pointed biscuit eaten with wine, or petites gastelles, the old French for little cakes.  This term may also reference the shape of a woman's petticoat);\nindividual round biscuits (shortbread rounds); or\na thick (\u00be\" or 2 cm) oblong slab cut into fingers.\nIn one the oldest shapes, bakers pinched the edges of a shortbread round to suggest the rays of the sun.\nThe stiff dough retains its shape well during cooking.  The biscuits are often patterned before cooking, usually with the tines of a fork or with a springerle-type mold.  Shortbread is sometimes shaped into hearts and other shapes for special occasions.\n\nIn ancient Scottish folklore, sun-shaped cakes, such as shortbread, had magic powers over the Sun during the Scottish New Year's Eve.\nShortbread is generally associated with and originated in Scotland, but due to its popularity it is also made in the rest of the United Kingdom, and similar biscuits are also made in Denmark, Ireland and Sweden.  The Scottish version is the best-known, and is widely exported.\nScottish chef John Quigley, of Glasgow's Red Onion, describes shortbread as \"the jewel in the crown\" of Scottish baking.\nAn early variety of shortbread, using ginger, was reportedly eaten during sittings of the Parliament of Scotland, and therefore the variety was sometimes called \"Parliament cake\" or \"Parlies\" into the 19th century. The biscuits were sold in Mrs Flockhart's tavern and shop in Bristo Street in Edinburgh's Potterrow. Known as Luckie Fykie, the landlady was thought to be the inspiration for Mrs Flockhart in Walter Scott's Waverley.\nIn the UK tax code, shortbread is taxed as a flour confection (baked good) rather than as a common biscuit.\nButter cookie\nMillionaire's shortbread, shortbread topped with caramel and chocolate\nShortcake, a soft cake with a similar name\nNankhatai\nList of shortbread biscuits and cookies\n\"Glycemic index for 60+ foods\".

                "description": "The primary ingredient used in kusksu is the broad bean, known locally as ful. Broad beans are well-adapted to the Maltese climate and can become invasive if left uncontrolled. In Malta, broad beans are typically sown in December and harvested during early spring. Their cultivation requires little or no care, and most Maltese farmers do not irrigate their crop. In 2016, Malta's National Statistics Office reported that 595 tonnes of broad beans were sold through official markets, a figure that puts into perspective why some locals refer to the broad bean as Malta's \"iconic\", or \"favourite\" bean. The small pasta beads, known as kusksu, are another key ingredient. ...",

Kusksu is a traditional Maltese soup made primarily from seasonal broad beans, small pasta beads, and fresh \u0121bejniet. Although similar in shape, the small pasta beads, known locally as kusksu, look like couscous, but this one tends to be lighter and fluffier in texture. In contrast, kusksu, which gives the soup its name, is \"miniature pasta\" which is thick and ideal for simmering. Once cooked, the short-cut pasta beads give the soup its distinctive creamy and warm texture, making it an ideal dish to serve during cold weather.\nGiven its close resemblance to couscous, it is likely that kusksu originated during Malta's Arab occupation. However, documentary evidence relating to this period is scarce. A reliable source dating back to the 18th century makes reference to peppercorn-like shaped pasta, suggesting that kusksu pasta was a staple in the Maltese diet.\nMultiple versions of this popular Maltese dish exist. Some have included fish, while others have introduced bacon, cabbage, and pumpkin to their kusksu recipe. However, the more \"authentic\", or perhaps \"original\" versions of the dish, kusksu bil-ful (kusksu with broad beans), tend to feature fewer and simpler ingredients that are in season. In 2002, MaltaPost issued a series of stamps to celebrate Maltese cuisine and the more traditional version of the dish, kusksu bil-ful, was included.\nList of Maltese dishes\nList of soups\nNevins, Debbie; Sheehan, Sean; Yong, Jui Lin (15 July 2019).

G\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n, salad roll, summer roll, fresh spring roll, spring roll, or rice paper roll, is a Vietnamese dish traditionally consisting of pork, prawn, vegetables, b\u00fan (rice vermicelli), and other ingredients wrapped in Vietnamese b\u00e1nh tr\u00e1ng (commonly known as rice paper or cold roll). Unlike other spring roll dishes which are believed to be originated from China, Vietnamese g\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n is the country's creation using rice paper .\nG\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n are served fresh while others are served fried, like the Vietnamese ch\u1ea3 gi\u00f2. They are served at room temperature (or cooled) and are not deep-fried or cooked on the outside. These rolls are considered to be a very popular appetizer with customers in Vietnamese restaurants.\nIn southern Vietnam, these rolls are called g\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n, meaning salad rolls, while in northern Vietnam, these rolls are called nem cu\u1ed1n, meaning nem rolls. In central Vietnam, they are simply called \"rice paper\" rolls. In the West, these rolls are called by several different English names, including \"salad roll\", \"spring roll\" and \"summer roll.\" Sometimes the word \"Vietnamese\" is added at the beginning of these words; for example, in Hong Kong, they are called \"Vietnamese rolls\", and in Australia and the United States they may be called \"Vietnamese spring rolls\" (although specifically in Australia they may sometimes be referred to as \"cold rolls\"). Some Asian restaurants in the United States also refer to them as \"crystal rolls\", \"soft rolls\" or \"salad rolls\". The name \"summer roll\" was popularized by some Vietnamese American restaurants for easier marketing and as a seasonal play on the term \"spring roll\".  But many Vietnamese American restaurants still use \"spring roll\" as the English translation.\nFresh rolls are easily distinguished from similar rolls by the fact that they are not fried, and the ingredients used are different from (deep-fried) Vietnamese egg rolls. \nIn Cambodia, Vietnamese g\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n are called nime chao, meaning \"raw rice paper\"; they are produced by a different technique in the Siem Reap and Battambang areas from that in Vietnam. Another dish called kuy tieu kat (\"cut rice noodles\") is created from steaming the water mixture and adding meat, vegetables and other assorted condiments. In Japan, they are called nama harumaki (\u751f\u6625\u5dfb\u304d, \"raw spring rolls\"), and are typically filled with shrimp.\nThe fillings can vary from the standard pork slices, pork sausage slices (ch\u1ea3), and shrimp; fish, pan-fried seafood (such as squid), beef poached in a lemongrass broth, tofu (for vegetarians), grilled nem n\u01b0\u1edbng sausages, braised pork, and egg are among some of the other popular spring roll variations.\nNem\nSpring roll\nCh\u1ea3\nThaker, Aruna; Barton, Arlene, eds.

                "description": "Preparation of pesarattu is not difficult but needs to be done with perfection to achieve the desired taste. The first step is soaking the \"pesalu\" or whole green gram (a 150 ml cup of gram makes about four medium pesarattus) in water for at least four hours (maximum of seven hours). The soaked gram is then ground to a smooth paste with a couple of green chilies, a small piece of ginger, and some salt. Water is added as required. The mixture is allowed to sit for a few minutes to ensure that the interiors of the grains are fully hydrated. The batter is poured onto a heated pan. If the preparation is meticulous, the pesarattu will slowly start to get crispy over the edges and start to unstick from the pan. ...",

Pesarattu, pesara attu, pesara dosa (mung bean dosa), or cheeldo is a crepe-like bread, originating in Andhra Pradesh, India, that is similar to dosa. It is made with green gram (moong dal) batter, but, unlike dosa, it does not contain urad dal. Pesarattu is eaten as breakfast and as a snack in Andhra Pradesh. It is typically served with ginger or tamarind chutney. Green chilies, ginger and onions are used in variants.\nA pesarattu served with upma is known as Pesarattupma. It is popular in South Indian Cities. Pesarattupma is a favourite in Coastal Andhra region especially the Godavari Districts , Krishna district, Guntur District, Nellore District, and Vishakapatnam District.\nSimilar variations are found in North Indian cuisine are moong daal ka cheela or besan ka cheela. In Rajasthan they are commonly known as cheeldo.\nBanh xeo\nBindae-tteok\nList of Indian breads\n\"Real street food - No 2: Pesarattu from Chennai\". The Guardian.

G\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n, salad roll, summer roll, fresh spring roll, spring roll, or rice paper roll, is a Vietnamese dish traditionally consisting of pork, prawn, vegetables, b\u00fan (rice vermicelli), and other ingredients wrapped in Vietnamese b\u00e1nh tr\u00e1ng (commonly known as rice paper or cold roll). Unlike other spring roll dishes which are believed to be originated from China, Vietnamese g\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n is the country's creation using rice paper .\nG\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n are served fresh while others are served fried, like the Vietnamese ch\u1ea3 gi\u00f2. They are served at room temperature (or cooled) and are not deep-fried or cooked on the outside. These rolls are considered to be a very popular appetizer with customers in Vietnamese restaurants.\nIn southern Vietnam, these rolls are called g\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n, meaning salad rolls, while in northern Vietnam, these rolls are called nem cu\u1ed1n, meaning nem rolls. In central Vietnam, they are simply called \"rice paper\" rolls. In the West, these rolls are called by several different English names, including \"salad roll\", \"spring roll\" and \"summer roll.\" Sometimes the word \"Vietnamese\" is added at the beginning of these words; for example, in Hong Kong, they are called \"Vietnamese rolls\", and in Australia and the United States they may be called \"Vietnamese spring rolls\" (although specifically in Australia they may sometimes be referred to as \"cold rolls\"). Some Asian restaurants in the United States also refer to them as \"crystal rolls\", \"soft rolls\" or \"salad rolls\". The name \"summer roll\" was popularized by some Vietnamese American restaurants for easier marketing and as a seasonal play on the term \"spring roll\".  But many Vietnamese American restaurants still use \"spring roll\" as the English translation.\nFresh rolls are easily distinguished from similar rolls by the fact that they are not fried, and the ingredients used are different from (deep-fried) Vietnamese egg rolls. \nIn Cambodia, Vietnamese g\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n are called nime chao, meaning \"raw rice paper\"; they are produced by a different technique in the Siem Reap and Battambang areas from that in Vietnam. Another dish called kuy tieu kat (\"cut rice noodles\") is created from steaming the water mixture and adding meat, vegetables and other assorted condiments. In Japan, they are called nama harumaki (\u751f\u6625\u5dfb\u304d, \"raw spring rolls\"), and are typically filled with shrimp.\nThe fillings can vary from the standard pork slices, pork sausage slices (ch\u1ea3), and shrimp; fish, pan-fried seafood (such as squid), beef poached in a lemongrass broth, tofu (for vegetarians), grilled nem n\u01b0\u1edbng sausages, braised pork, and egg are among some of the other popular spring roll variations.\nNem\nSpring roll\nCh\u1ea3\nThaker, Aruna; Barton, Arlene, eds.

The ground rice is then soaked in coconut milk until it is soft, after which sugar and chocolate powder are added. The mixture is cooked over low fire while repeatedly stirred.

In Filipino cuisine, moron (also spelled mor\u00f3n or muron, the stress is placed on the last syllable) is a rice cake similar to suman. It is a native delicacy in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines, particularly in the area around Tacloban City in the province of Leyte and in Eastern Samar province. Other parts of the Philippines have their versions of it, however. In fact, the moron was adopted as one of Mambajao, Camiguin's locally-produced products.\nSince it is a variety of suman, the moron is cooked with glutinous rice, coconut milk and sugar. The main difference is that moron is gyrated with chocolate tablea (tablets) or mixed with cocoa powder while a regular suman is not. It also has a hint of vanilla and is usually partnered with coffee or sikwate (a native Philippine chocolate drink). With chocolate as its distinct ingredient, it is also called chocolate moron or chocolate suman.\nMoron is usually sold in bundles of four pieces that are individually wrapped in a banana leaf. Tourists from Leyte usually buy moron as a pasalubong or gift for their relatives and friends.  In the places where moron originated, it is usually served at festivals, birthday parties, and funeral wakes.  Visitors from those parties usually takes home some of the moron. The food is also a medium of exchange for goodwill in Tacloban and the nearby municipalities of Palo, Tanauan, Tolosa, Dulag, Mayorga and Abuyog.\nPhilippine government agencies usually promote and support locally produced goods such as the moron.  The Department of Science and Technology of the Philippines advocated the longer shelf life of food products including the moron to help producers of those kind of food products while the Department of Trade and Industry of the Philippines conducted trade fairs to develop and promote products, which included the moron.  The Department of Labor and Employment of the Philippines meanwhile made a project in Mambujao, Camiguin for the production of moron.\nBinagol\nMoron (psychology)\nPastrano, Mozart (February 27, 2014). \"Tacloban's 'moron' lives on\".

It also goes under the names of Bohnen, Birnen und Speck and, locally, the Low German names of Grner Hein and Grnen Heini (lit: \"Green Harry\").

Generally cut French beans (Brechbohnen) are used. In Hamburg on the markets occasionally \"Turkish peas\" may be found, despite its name a Vierlande bean variety that used to be frequently used for this dish. During preparation several sprigs of savory are added to the beans.\nThe pears used for this dish are cooking pears which would otherwise be inedible eaten as fruit in their own right. They are small, green, rock-hard and do not have the sweetness and juiciness of the popular eating varieties. These pears are mainly found at markets and in small vegetable shops. In the Hamburg area, other varieties are used: the Vierl\u00e4nder and the rather sweeter Finkenwerder cooking pears. The Vierl\u00e4nder sort have a slightly firmer consistency after cooking which is preferred by many.\nThese cooking pears are only available from July to September, subject to the weather. As a last resort for those who have missed the right season, B\u00fcrgermeisterbirne pears may be used. They are not as sweet when raw and are clearly sweeter.\nThe bacon used is streaky, smoky bacon. Here, too, it is important if the dish is to taste its best not to use 'any old bacon'. The origin\u2014whether from the Vierlande, the Black Forest or Tyrol\u2014is immaterial; all of them are suitable and offer a variety of interesting flavours. The deciding factor is the storage of the bacon. Only streaky bacon that has been air-dried and stored produces when cooked that pleasant taste of seasoned fat that melts in the mouth. Bacon, which\u2014as is common today\u2014has been stored hygienically in its vacuum wrapper, only produces a sort of fibrous stringiness after being cooked.\nThe Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein preference is to add potatoes to their Bohnen, Birnen und Speck that are still firm when cooked\u2014such as the Cilena or Linda varieties. In Land Hadeln beef or lamb can also be cooked along with the bacon.\nAccording to taste, the bacon is placed either in complete strips or cut up into water which is then brought to the boil. Meanwhile, the beans are cleaned, washed and cut into sections. After 25 minutes of cooking, the beans are added together with the savory to the bacon and cooking continues.\nThe flowers are removed from the pears, but the stalks are left on. The pears are left with their skins on throughout. They are then laid on the beans and everything is cooked together.\nThe peeled potatoes are boiled separately in salted water. Towards the end of the overall cooking time of about 50 minutes, some flour is mixed with water, poured into the pot and briefly boiled up.\nTypical quantities for four people are:\n750 g\tbeans\n500 g\tpears\n400 g  bacon\n500 g\tpotatoes\n1 sprig of savory\n2 tablespoons of flour\nEach person is served one or two pears, a good portion of bacon, beans and potatoes and broth according to preference. A fresh beer goes well with the dish.\nThere are variations that do away with the savory, but add freshly chopped parsley towards the end, which use broth instead of water for cooking (ready-made or home-made) or which use pepper.\nList of stews\n",

The santol rind is then added and cooked for a few minutes before coconut cream (kakang gata) is poured into the pan and allowed to boil until cooked. It is spiced with bagoong alamang, siling haba chilis, and salt and pepper to taste.

F\u0151zel\u00e9k is a type of thick Hungarian vegetable stew or soup, similar to pottage. F\u0151zel\u00e9k is a special category in Hungarian cuisine, not  quite like a soup, and thinner than a stew. It is simply cooked, typically by simmering, not mashing. It is usually not cooked with meat, but bacon and spicy sausage may be added for flavor. F\u0151zel\u00e9k is often eaten as the main course for lunch or like a garnish for different meat courses. F\u0151zel\u00e9k was typically a home-made food, and was considered as an ordinary type of meal so traditionally it seldom appeared on restaurant menus but in recent years, as part of the culinary revolution in Hungary, f\u0151zel\u00e9k enjoys a revival and it is much more common to be found on menus, there are even places dedicated to offering various f\u0151zel\u00e9k as main course.\nIts name roots in the verb f\u0151z (\"cook\"), modified by the -(a/e)l\u00e9k suffix which renders the meaning to the results of the verb. Thus the word f\u0151zel\u00e9k approximately means \"[something] created by cooking\". Hence in Hungarian a prefix is always used to make clear what the given f\u0151zel\u00e9k is actually made of, e.g.: t\u00f6kf\u0151zel\u00e9k (traditionally made of marrow but zucchini or other type of squash is also becoming popular), babf\u0151zel\u00e9k (made of beans) etc.\nList of stews\nEmperor's Crumbs, The culinary crossroads of Central Europe Archived 2010-07-09 at the Wayback Machine.\nJune Meyers Authentic Hungarian Heirloon Recipes Cookbook\nGundel's Hungarian Cookbook, Karoly Gundel.",

In Hamburg on the markets occasionally \"Turkish peas\" may be found, despite its name a Vierlande bean variety that used to be frequently used for this dish.

In the Hamburg area, other varieties are used: the Vierl\u00e4nder and the rather sweeter Finkenwerder cooking pears. The Vierl\u00e4nder sort have a slightly firmer consistency after cooking which is preferred by many.\nThese cooking pears are only available from July to September, subject to the weather. As a last resort for those who have missed the right season, B\u00fcrgermeisterbirne pears may be used. They are not as sweet when raw and are clearly sweeter.\nThe bacon used is streaky, smoky bacon. Here, too, it is important if the dish is to taste its best not to use 'any old bacon'. The origin\u2014whether from the Vierlande, the Black Forest or Tyrol\u2014is immaterial; all of them are suitable and offer a variety of interesting flavours. The deciding factor is the storage of the bacon. Only streaky bacon that has been air-dried and stored produces when cooked that pleasant taste of seasoned fat that melts in the mouth. Bacon, which\u2014as is common today\u2014has been stored hygienically in its vacuum wrapper, only produces a sort of fibrous stringiness after being cooked.\nThe Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein preference is to add potatoes to their Bohnen, Birnen und Speck that are still firm when cooked\u2014such as the Cilena or Linda varieties. In Land Hadeln beef or lamb can also be cooked along with the bacon.\nList of stews\n",

Pichelsteiner is a German stew that contains several kinds of meat and vegetables.\nThe creation of this dish has been traced to Auguste Winkler (n\u00e9e Kiesling).  Originally from Kirchberg im Wald, she worked as an innkeeper in Grattersdorf, where she is also buried.\nThe name is likely to have derived from the nearby B\u00fcchelstein mountain, where the annual B\u00fcchelsteiner Fest has been celebrated since 1839. As early as the 40th anniversary in 1879, the open-air-cooking festival was considered a tradition, and because the letter \u00fc is pronounced like i in the local dialect, the dish's name developed.\nIn Regen, a town in the Bavarian Forest, the citizens have met annually since 1874 on Kirchweih Monday to eat Pichelsteiner together, a tradition that is still alive today. They also claim the name's etymology. In their opinion, it derives from the pot in which the stew is cooked, which was called a pichel in the past, but this version is highly questioned by Bavarian researcher Max Peinkofer.\nThe dish was first mentioned in a cookbook in 1894.\nBavarian cuisine\nBosnian pot\nIrish stew\nList of stews\nNikujaga\nSwabian cuisine\nMax Peinkofer, \"B\u00fcchelsteinerfest und B\u00fcchelsteinerfleisch\" [The festival and meats of B\u00fcchelstein (a mountain in Bavaria, Germany)] in: Der Brunnkorb [a fountain in the town of Tittling, Bavaria, Germany], (Passau, Germany: Verlag Passavia, 1977), ISBN\u00a03-87616-060-X\nArticle in German",

It is an important part of South African,  Zimbabwean and Namibian cuisine and is popular across Southern Africa. The name is derived from the Afrikaans words boer (\"farmer\") and wors (\"sausage\"). According to South African government regulation boerewors must contain at least 90 percent meat, and always contain beef, as well as lamb, pork, or a mixture of lamb and pork. The other 10% is made up of spices and other ingredients. Not more than 30% of the meat content may be fat. Boerewors may not contain offal or any \"mechanically recovered\" meat pulp (as recovered through a process where meat and bone are mechanically separated).\nBoerewors is made from coarsely minced beef (sometimes combined with minced pork, lamb, or both) and spices (usually toasted coriander seed, black pepper, nutmeg, cloves and allspice). Like many other forms of sausage, boerewors contains a high proportion of fat, and is preserved with salt and vinegar, and packed in sausage casings. Traditional boerewors is usually formed into a continuous spiral. It is often served with pap (traditional South African porridge / polenta made from mielie-meal). Boerewors is also very common throughout Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe as well as with expatriate South African communities worldwide.\nOn 3 May 2014, the Guinness World Record for braaing the longest boerewors in the world was broken in South Africa. It measured 1,557.15\u00a0m (5,108\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) in length. The boerewors was distributed freely to old-age homes and the Abraham Kriel Orphanage.\nThe many varieties of boerewors include specialties such as garlic wors, kameeldoring (camel thorn), Karoowors (sausage from the Karoo region in South Africa), and spekwors (made with extra cubed pork fat). Other ingredients include cheese and chilli peppers.\nA similar sausage may also be made from the meat of different animal species, such as kudu, and springbok, but it may not be sold as boerewors. Instead, it is named after the predominant meat species, but only if it contains at least 75% meat from that specific species.  When a sausage is made from different types of game, it may not be labelled boerewors but must be labelled as sausage and with the names of all the game species in it.\nBoerewors does not keep well unrefrigerated. A similar dried or cured sausage called dro\u00ebwors is prepared instead in a process similar to the preparation of biltong. Dro\u00ebwors has become popular in its own right as a snack.\nIn response to the modern plant-based food movement, various vegan boerewors variants, mostly made by small and home-based industries, have begun to appear in retailers and food markets in South Africa.\nThe preparation and grilling of boerewors has become a fine art with many local, regional and national competitions taking place. The Shoprite supermarket chain hosts an annual competition to determine the best new preparations. The winner of this competition has the privilege of having their product/recipe manufactured and sold in all Checkers stores nationwide, under the Championship Boerewors brand.\nSouth African cuisine\n\"Boerewors, n.\".

Popular belief also ascribes aphrodisiac properties to paila marina.\nIn the episode \"Abiquiu\" of the US TV series Breaking Bad, the character Gus Fring, a prominent Chilean methamphetamine distributor in the southwest of the United States, prepares a paila marina for Walter White while explaining the origin of this typical Chilean dish.

Birnen, Bohnen und Speck (\"pears, beans and bacon\") is a North German dish which is especially popular in the states of Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Hamburg. It also goes under the names of Bohnen, Birnen und Speck and, locally, the Low German names of Gr\u00f6\u00f6ner Hein and Gr\u00f6nen Heini (lit: \"Green Harry\"). The ingredients required mean that the dish is mainly eaten in the months of August and September.\nThe dish is a type of stew, in which\u2014as the name indicates\u2014the main ingredients are pears, beans and bacon. In North German country kitchens, potatoes would also be added, even though they are not specifically mentioned.\nGenerally cut French beans (Brechbohnen) are used. In Hamburg on the markets occasionally \"Turkish peas\" may be found, despite its name a Vierlande bean variety that used to be frequently used for this dish. During preparation several sprigs of savory are added to the beans.\nThe pears used for this dish are cooking pears which would otherwise be inedible eaten as fruit in their own right. They are small, green, rock-hard and do not have the sweetness and juiciness of the popular eating varieties. These pears are mainly found at markets and in small vegetable shops. In the Hamburg area, other varieties are used: the Vierl\u00e4nder and the rather sweeter Finkenwerder cooking pears. The Vierl\u00e4nder sort have a slightly firmer consistency after cooking which is preferred by many.\nThese cooking pears are only available from July to September, subject to the weather. As a last resort for those who have missed the right season, B\u00fcrgermeisterbirne pears may be used. They are not as sweet when raw and are clearly sweeter.\nThe bacon used is streaky, smoky bacon. Here, too, it is important if the dish is to taste its best not to use 'any old bacon'. The origin\u2014whether from the Vierlande, the Black Forest or Tyrol\u2014is immaterial; all of them are suitable and offer a variety of interesting flavours. The deciding factor is the storage of the bacon. Only streaky bacon that has been air-dried and stored produces when cooked that pleasant taste of seasoned fat that melts in the mouth. Bacon, which\u2014as is common today\u2014has been stored hygienically in its vacuum wrapper, only produces a sort of fibrous stringiness after being cooked.\nThe Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein preference is to add potatoes to their Bohnen, Birnen und Speck that are still firm when cooked\u2014such as the Cilena or Linda varieties. In Land Hadeln beef or lamb can also be cooked along with the bacon.\nList of stews\n",

Tchaka or Chaka is a Haitian stew made from hominy, beans, pumpkin (joumou), and meat (usually pork). It is used as an offering to the loa in Haitian Vodou. The nutritious soup is also associated with festivities and family time.\nOther names for the dish are tyaka, chaka, or tiaka depending on the region. Typical of Haitian cuisine, this dish has influences of many different cultures.\nTchaka is relatively simple to make. However, it often requires several hours of preparation to allow flavors to develop and incorporate throughout the soup. Unlike other soups where the ingredients are prepared in the same pot, for tchaka, the ingredients are usually cooked separately before being combined. This is because the different ingredients have different cooking times. The red beans and corn are soaked for several hours. The pork is boiled then grilled in oil. Then the beans, corn, and meat are combined and simmered at low heat for about two hours. The tchaka is simmered to the desired consistency which is usually on the thicker side. Some add pumpkin to the tchaka, where a cooked piece of pumpkin is pureed and added to the other ingredients before simmering. The stew is served hot. It is sometimes served with a pickle on the side.\nSeveral other local variations exist which use beef, mutton, or crab instead of pork. Some recipes use coconut milk which provides a creamy consistency. Some recipes use squash, yam, or malanga.\nTchaka is usually served during special occasions because it requires a relatively long time to prepare. For example, it can be served during family gatherings. It can also be served on November 1 for All Saints\u2019 Day, on May 1 for Labor Day to honor Azakah Medeh, the loa of harvest and agriculture. In Haitian Vodou, tchaka was the favorite dish of this loa.\nTchaka was mentioned in a song by Haitian musician, Sydney Guillaume, when he wrote: \n\u201cChofe dife! Nou pral manje tchaka! Chofe dife, brase mayi, pa bliye tisale, Nou pral manje yon bon tchaka. Nou pral voye monte yon bouyon t\u00e8t chaje\u201d (\u201cLight the fire! We will eat tchaka! Light the fire, mix the corn, don\u2019t forget the salted pork, we will eat a delicious tchaka, we will cook an incredible stew\u201d).\nHaitians oftentimes cook tchaka during school vacations since it is protein-rich and thought to help with children\u2019s growth.\nList of soups\nFoundation, A.R.C.

It looks similar to grits, but is smoother in texture since it is made with ground wheat kernels instead of ground corn. It was first manufactured in the United States in 1893 by wheat millers in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The product made its debut at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Before January 2007, Cream of Wheat was a Nabisco brand made by Kraft Foods. In January 2007, B&G Foods acquired the brand and all rights to market the cereal. \"Cream of Wheat\" is a registered trademark. ...",

After the Panic of 1893, the Diamond Milling Company in Grand Forks was faced with low prices and reduced demand for flour. The head miller proposed that the company package a breakfast porridge that his wife would make from the portion of the wheat not used in making flour. The company sent samples of the hand-packaged product with its regular orders of flour, and soon received a telegram that said \"Never mind shipping us anymore of your flour, but send us a carload of Cream of Wheat.\" \nDiamond Milling directed its factory to begin manufacturing only Cream of Wheat. As demand increased, the company moved to a new factory in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1897, and changed its name to Cream of Wheat Company.\nCream of Wheat is prepared from the box by boiling water or milk, then pouring in the farina while stirring. As it is stirred, the farina starts to thicken. The use of milk instead of (or in addition to) water gives the dish a creamier taste.\nIn the United States market, there are three unflavored mixes available (10-minute, 2+1\u20442-minute and 1-minute). In the Canadian market, there are two unflavored mixes available (8-minute and 3-minute).\nCream of Wheat is also sold in an instant format which includes the use of single-serving packets. These are prepared by simply mixing their contents with hot water and allowing the result to set in a bowl for approximately two minutes.\nIt is common to customize the hot cereal with the addition of sugar, fruit, or nuts. As a result, several flavors are sold of the instant variety: Original, Apples 'N' Cinnamon, Maple Brown Sugar, Strawberries 'N' Cream, and Cinnamon Swirl. In October 2012, Cream of Wheat added a new chocolate flavor to their instant line. Their most recent addition to the varieties of instant Cream of Wheat Cereals is Bananas & Cream.\nThe original boxes of Cream of Wheat were handmade and lettered, and were emblazoned with the image of an African American chef produced by Emery Mapes. The character was named Rastus and was developed by artist Edward V. Brewer. Rastus was included on all boxes and advertisements. It has long been thought that a chef named Frank L. White was the model for the chef shown on the Cream of Wheat box\u2014a claim White himself made. White's headstone contains his name and an etching taken from the man depicted on the Cream of Wheat box.\nLeading up to 2020, there had been public pressure aimed at various companies to change branding with perceived racist origins, such as Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben's. The character of Rastus had once been depicted as a cook who was barely literate and did not know about vitamins. Rastus is also a derogatory term traditionally associated with African Americans in the United States. For these reasons, B&G Foods had been under public pressure for years to make changes.\nPublic demands to remove symbols of racism increased during the 2020 protests around racism.

Malawach or Melawwa\u1e25, (Hebrew: \u05de\u05dc\u05d5\u05d5\u05d7\u200e; literally means \"board-like bread\"), is a flatbread that is traditional in Yemenite Jewish cuisine. It was brought to Israel by Yemenite Jews. Malawach resembles a thick pancake but consists of thin layers of puff pastry brushed with oil or fat and cooked flat in a frying pan. It is traditionally served with hard-boiled eggs, zhug, and a crushed or grated tomato dip. Sometimes it is served with honey.\n\"The dough traditionally takes three days to make, since it is a multi-stage process, and the dough must rest in between each phase.\u201d\n\u2014\u2009Regev Eibenschutz\nMalawach is made from the same dough as jachnun, a Yemenite Jewish Shabbat bread, and both originated as a variation of hojaldre, a Sephardic Jewish puff pastry, brought to Yemen by Jews expelled from Spain. Hojaldre later became \"ajin\", an enriched dough only made by the Yemenite Jews, and was not made by the non-Jewish Yemenis, according to Rabbi Gil Marks, a Jewish food historian\nMalawach has historically been a staple of the Yemenite Jews. Through exodus of Yemenite Jews from Yemen in the mid-20th century, and their subsequent refuge in Israel, it has become a very popular dish in Israel, and a favorite comfort food for Israelis of all backgrounds and origins. Malawach is traditionally made at home by members of the Yemenite Jewish community, but with the newfound, widespread popularity of malawach in Israel in recent decades it is now commonly served at restaurants in Israel, many of which are dedicated to serving malawach, and related dishes such as jachnun. It is commonly used as a sandwich wrap similar to a laffa, and is commonly served with shakshouka, hummus, sabich, and many other dishes. It is also commonly served as a dessert with labneh and jam. It is also used as a pizza crust. Frozen malawah is commonly available in grocery stores across the nation, by brands such as Ta'amti, and Osem, and is exported abroad to kosher supermarkets in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and other nations. Frozen malawach can be used as a substitute for dough in different recipes such as bourekas, sambusak, and many others.\nYemenite Jewish cuisine\nIsraeli cuisine\nIsraeli culture\nSephardic Jewish cuisine\nJachnun\nKubaneh\nMarks, Rabbi Gil.

Early cooks set thick corn dough on a wooden board or barrel stave, which they leaned on a piece of wood or a rock in front of an open fire to bake. In the American south during the 18th century versions were made with rice or hominy flour and perhaps cassava. A 1905 cookbook includes a recipe for \"Alabama Johnny Cake\" made with rice and 'meal'.

Johnnycake (also called journey cake, johnny bread, hoecake,  shawnee cake or  spider cornbread) is a cornmeal flatbread. An early American staple food, it is prepared on the Atlantic coast from Newfoundland to Jamaica. The food originates from the indigenous people of North America. It is still eaten in the West Indies, Dominican Republic, Saint Croix, The Bahamas, Colombia, Bermuda and Florida as well as in the United States and Canada.\nThe modern johnnycake is found in the cuisine of New England and is often claimed as originating in Rhode Island. A modern johnnycake is fried cornmeal gruel, which is made from yellow or white cornmeal mixed with salt and hot water or milk, and sometimes sweetened. In the Southern United States, the term used is hoecake, although this can also refer to cornbread fried in a pan.\n\nThe earliest attestation of the term \"johnny cake\" is from 1739 (in South Carolina); the spelling \"journey cake\" is only attested from 1775 on the Gulf Coast, but may be the earlier form.\nThe word is likely based on the word Jonakin, recorded in New England in 1765, itself derived from the word jannock, recorded in Northern England in the sixteenth century. According to Edward Ellis Morris, the term was the name given \"... by the [American] negroes to a cake made of Indian corn (maize).\"\nAnother suggested derivation is that it comes from Shawnee cake, although some writers disagree.\nThe term hoecake is first attested in 1745, and the term is used by American writers such as Joel Barlow and Washington Irving. The origin of the name is the method of preparation: they were cooked on a type of iron pan called a hoe. There is conflicting evidence regarding the common belief that they were cooked on the blades of gardening hoes.\nA hoecake can be made either out of cornbread batter or leftover biscuit dough. A cornbread hoecake is thicker than a cornbread pancake.\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas using ground corn for cooking are credited with teaching Europeans how to make the food. It is also claimed that johnnycakes were made by the Narragansett People as far back as the 1600s.\nSouthern Native American culture (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek) is the cornerstone of Southern cuisine. From this culture came one of the main staples of the Southern diet: corn (maize). Corn was used to make all kinds of dishes from the familiar cornbread and grits to liquors such as whiskey and moonshine, which were important trade items. Cornbread was popular during the American Civil War because it was very cheap and could be made in many different sizes and forms.  It could be fashioned into high-rising, fluffy loaves or simply fried for a fast meal.\nTo a far greater degree than anyone realizes, several of the most important food dishes that the Southeastern Indians live on today is the \"soul food\" eaten by both black and white Southerners. Hominy, for example, is still eaten ... Sofkee live on as grits ... cornbread [is] used by Southern cooks ... Indian fritters ... variously known as \"hoe cake\", ... or \"Johnny cake.\"... Indian boiled cornbread is present in Southern cuisine as \"corn meal dumplings\", ... and as \"hush puppies\", ... Southerners cook their beans and field peas by boiling them, as did the Indians ... like the Indians they cure their meat and smoke it over hickory coals.\n\nIn Australia, \"johnny cakes\" refers to a quick bread usually known as damper, but  cooked as smaller, individually-sized portions, and often pan-fried, rather than as a loaf. It is uncertain if this name was influenced by the term for North American cornmeal bread. However, Australian johnny cakes are made with wheat flour rather than cornmeal; the cakes are baked in the hot coals of a fire or fried in fat in a frying pan (skillet).\nIn the Bahamas \"Johnny Cake\" refers to a bread made with flour, sugar, butter, and water. After being kneaded the bread is baked until lightly browned, and has a soft and malleable middle. This bread is usually eaten with soup or on its own. The common bread consumed in the Bahamas in 1725 was made of Corn and Flour, Mark Catesby, a naturalist stated in his book \"The natural history of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands\": \"Their bread is made of Maiz, or Indian Corn, and also of Wheat; the first they cultivate but not sufficient for their consumption. Wheat is imported to them in Flower from the Northern Colonies.\" In the late 19th-century corn was still an ingredient in Bahamian Johnny Bread, but at some point in the 20th-century, it was removed.\nYaniqueques or yanikeke are a Dominican Republic version of the jonnycake, supposedly brought over in the nineteenth century by English-speaking migrants (possibly of Afro-Caribbean descent).",

It is commonly served as a breakfast or dinner dish. It was brought to Israel by Yemenite Jews. It is somewhat similar to the Jewish matzah brei or the Mexican-American migas, which are made with matzo, and corn tortillas, respectively; whereas fatoot samneh is made with pita bread.\nFatoot samneh originated as a way for the Yemenite Jewish community to use and repurpose stale pita bread that would have otherwise been discarded. The Yemenite Jewish community was historically very poor, and most of their meals consisted of various soups and stews. Bread such as pita was very valuable, as was \"samneh\", or clarified butter, and their families were often large and the women of the community traditionally had to make do and cook as many meals as possible from their limited resources to feed their families. Over time fatoot samneh became a popular, and traditional dish among the Yemenite Jews as both a way to use up stale pita bread that was past its prime, as well as a popular breakfast or dinner dish.\nFatoot samneh consists of pita bread or some other flatbread such as saluf, laffa, or malawach, that was often leftover from another use or stale, and has been torn or cut into pieces and fried until crisp in a large amount of samneh (clarified butter), although butter or chicken schmaltz are also sometimes used. The mixture is combined with beaten/scrambled eggs, and cooked together in a manner similar to matzah brei or migas. In Israel it is traditionally topped with honey as a sweet dish, although savory versions also exist and some top it with labneh, tahini, shkug, resek avganiyot (grated tomatoes), among other toppings. Fatoot samneh has been compared by some to various dishes such as matzo brei, and migas, among others.\nMarks, Gil. The Encyclopedia of Jewish Food.\nKoenig, Leah. The Jewish Cookbook.

A 1905 cookbook includes a recipe for \"Alabama Johnny Cake\" made with rice and 'meal'.

Johnnycake (also called journey cake, johnny bread, hoecake,  shawnee cake or  spider cornbread) is a cornmeal flatbread. An early American staple food, it is prepared on the Atlantic coast from Newfoundland to Jamaica. The food originates from the indigenous people of North America. It is still eaten in the West Indies, Dominican Republic, Saint Croix, The Bahamas, Colombia, Bermuda and Florida as well as in the United States and Canada.\nThe modern johnnycake is found in the cuisine of New England and is often claimed as originating in Rhode Island. A modern johnnycake is fried cornmeal gruel, which is made from yellow or white cornmeal mixed with salt and hot water or milk, and sometimes sweetened. In the Southern United States, the term used is hoecake, although this can also refer to cornbread fried in a pan.\n\nThe earliest attestation of the term \"johnny cake\" is from 1739 (in South Carolina); the spelling \"journey cake\" is only attested from 1775 on the Gulf Coast, but may be the earlier form.\nThe word is likely based on the word Jonakin, recorded in New England in 1765, itself derived from the word jannock, recorded in Northern England in the sixteenth century.

The name literally means \"apple slices\" in Danish, although apples are not usually an ingredient in present-day versions. The crust is similar in texture to European pancakes, but with a light and fluffy innard like a Yorkshire pudding. The English language spelling is usually aebleskiver or ebleskiver.\n\u00c6bleskiver are cooked on the stove top by baking in a special pan with several hemispherical indentations. The pan exists in versions for gas and electrical stoves (the latter with a plain bottom). Pans are usually made of cast iron, allowing good heat retention. Traditional models in hammered copper plate exist but are today used primarily for decoration.\nIn Denmark, \u00e6bleskiver are less common in restaurants than they are at casual family gatherings. They can also be found being sold by street vendors in the winter. They are traditionally served with jam and powdered sugar and three are placed on a plate at a time. They are traditionally eaten during the Christmas season and are often served with gl\u00f8gg (Scandinavian mulled wine) or Scandinavian coffee. They are often sold at Christmas markets, charity markets, open-air events, Scouting functions, local sports gatherings and similar venues. They are also served at children's birthday parties, due to their popularity and easy preparation. Voluntary associations gain profit from preparing them from the pre-fried, frozen stage and selling them, usually three at a time, with the usual condiments.\nIn North America there are several annual events that celebrate \u00e6bleskiver and Danish culture, with churches and museums holding \"\u00c6bleskiver Suppers\" and similar events.\nThe exact origin of \u00e6bleskiver is unknown. One popular speculation is that a band of Vikings were part of a difficult battle. When they returned to their ship, they wished to cook a meal similar to pancakes. However, since they lacked regular pans, they instead used their shields or helmets, resulting in a cake with a spherical shape.\nAccording to another explanation, the custom of making a special sliced-apple dish originated in the Middle Ages when it was impossible to store raw apples beyond a certain date. The last apples of the year's harvest were sliced, used to flavor gl\u00f8gg, scooped out of the gl\u00f8gg, wrapped in dough, and fried in fat or butter like a Berliner. This is the origin of the name, which means \"apple slices\". In the 17th century, as cast iron pans with hemispherical concavities became available, \u00e6bleskiver could be easily made throughout the year, and the variety of fruit and other fillings expanded.\nThe first appearance of the word \"\u00e6bleskiver\" occurs in Peters Jul (1866), a book of Yule poems by Johan Krohn (1841\u20131925; son of Frederik Christopher Krohn and brother of Pietro Krohn). \"Apple-filled \u00e6bleskiver\" are also mentioned in the 1872 story \"The Cripple\" (Kr\u00f8blingen) by Hans Christian Andersen.\nIn the United States, pans were manufactured by Griswold Manufacturing.\nPuff Puff (food)\nList of doughnut varieties\nDanish cuisine\u00a0\u2013 Culinary traditions of Denmark\nEgg waffle\u00a0\u2013 Small spherical pancakes\nGai daan jai, a similar Chinese dish.\nJemput-jemput\u00a0\u2013 Indonesian and Malaysian fritter, similar Malaysian snack.\nKue cucur\u00a0\u2013 Indonesian traditional snack, similar Indonesian snack.\nList of pancakes\nMunker, the Norwegian version.\nPaniyaram, a similar dish from the south of India that comes in sweet and savoury varieties.\nPoffertjes\u00a0\u2013 Traditional Dutch batter treat, a similar Dutch dish that is sweet.\nPopover\u00a0\u2013 Light, hollow roll made from an egg batter\nTakoyaki\u00a0\u2013 Japanese appetizer, a savoury Japanese version that features octopus.\nUnni Appam, a similar dish from Kerala that is made in both sweet and spicy styles.\n\u00a0Food portal\n\"History\".

The potatoes are cut into thin strips and layered in a roasting tin, alternating with the sprats and chopped onions in between. Salt and pepper is put over each layer, then cream is added so that it almost fills the tin. It is finally baked in an oven at 200\u00a0\u00b0C (392\u00a0\u00b0F) for about one hour.\nThe recipe is often mistranslated into English, with anchovies being substituted for sprats. This is because sprats (Sprattus sprattus) pickled in sugar, salt and spices have been known in Sweden as ansjovis since the middle of the 19th century, while true anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus) are sold in Sweden as sardeller (sardelles). Also, small herrings (Clupea harengus) may be used instead of sprats.\nIt has often been associated with the opera singer Per Adolf \"Pelle\" Janzon (1844\u20131889), remembered as a gourmand. However, another claim for the origin of the name has been made by Gunnar Stigmark (1910\u20132001) in an article, \"S\u00e5 var det med Janssons frestelse\", which appeared in the periodical Gastronomisk kalender. According to Stigmark, the name was borrowed from the film Janssons frestelse (1928) featuring the film actor and director Edvin Adolphson; as a name for this dish, it was coined by Stigmark's mother and her hired female chef for the particular occasion of a society dinner, whence it spread to other households and eventually into cookbooks.\nList of casserole dishes\nWebb, Loios Sinaiko.

Poppy seed paste, also known as mohn is a common ingredient in Jewish pastries and desserts, and is made from ground poppy seeds and additional sweeteners. Examples of pastries featuring the filling include mohn kichel, babka, and, most famously, hamantashen. In Jewish cuisine, the filling is traditionally referred to as mohn, the word for poppy in both Yiddish and German. Poppy seed-filled pastries are particularly associated with the holiday of Purim\nPoppy seed paste generally has a very thick, paste-like consistency similar to peanut butter or a thick custard, which can grow hard during cooking. It is typically sweet but has been said to have a subtle bitterness and citrus notes due to the poppy seeds. Sometimes lemon or orange zest is added to further accentuate these notes. As the poppy seeds have been ground to a powdery consistency, they have less of a tendency to get stuck in people's teeth than whole poppy seeds.\nIn Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, there are two main kinds of poppy seed filling used in order to accommodate kosher dietary laws. Dairy mohn, which may contain milk, heavy cream, and/or butter; and which is used in baked goods such as hamantaschen which are made with a dough containing dairy and which will be served with a dairy meal. And pareve (non-dairy) poppy seed filling which typically replaces the milk with water and the butter with margarine or oil, and is used in pastries that are meant to be served with meat meals such as mohn rolls, pareve hamantaschen, etc. Pareve poppy seed filling is also suitable for vegan recipes.\nPoppy seeds were one of the most popular spices in medieval Central Europe, known as mohn in German and Yiddish and m\u00e1k in Hungarian.\nTraditionally, poppy seed filling was almost exclusively prepared at home. Immigrants brought poppy seeds to the United States, with the first recipes for poppy seed cookies attested as early as 1889 in cookbooks published by German-Jewish immigrants. Beginning in the 20th century, various commercially-made canned varieties by brands such as \"Solo\" became available and are still sold online and in grocery stores in areas of the United States with significant Jewish populations such as the Northeast, Southern California, and South Florida. Homemade and premade renditions have significant differences in ingredients, and premade filling is generally dairy-free.

Mee goreng, or mi goreng, refers to fried noodles in the Malay-speaking cultures of several countries, such as the Southeast Asian states of Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore. \nA notable variant, mee goreng mamak is associated with Mamak stalls operated by Muslim Indian communities within the region, and is often spicy in taste.\nNumerous distinct variations of mee goreng may be found in Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore.  \nOne version is believed to have been developed by Indian immigrants, often of Tamil Muslim origin, who drew influences from other cultures and incorporated them into their cooking. This style of mee goreng is regarded as a dish unique to the region, as it cannot be found in India.\nIn Malaysia, Mamak-style mee goreng is prepared and sold at Mamak stalls around the country. The word mamak is from the Tamil term for maternal uncle; in Malaysia and Singapore, it is traditionally used an honorific to respectfully address shopkeepers or proprietors of dining establishments. Mee goreng mamak is often associated with Indian Muslim cuisine offered at Mamak stalls, and is regarded as a fusion food that incorporates Chinese yellow noodles with seasonings and spices typical of Malay and Indian cuisine.\nMaggi goreng, or Maggi mee goreng, is a variation of Mamak-style mee goreng. It uses Maggi brand of instant noodles, prepared with hot water before stir-frying, instead of fresh yellow noodles.\nIn Singapore, mee goreng is often associated with cooking typical of Indian Muslim cuisine, known for its frequent use of ingredients such as lamb or mutton. A famous variant developed by restaurateurs of Chinese ethnic origin for their restaurant in Punggol during the 1970's was cooked with seafood, bean sprouts, coriander, and a sambal (spicy chilli relish) sauce made up of twelve herbs and spices.\nMee goreng exists in Sri Lankan cuisine due to historical Malay cultural influences.\nBihun goreng\nChar kway teow\nMee siam\nAzli Azney (October 29, 2017). \"'In it for the long run'\".

A date shake is a milkshake made with dates. The drink originated in, and is particularly associated with, the Coachella Valley in California.\nAt the end of the 19th century into the beginning of the 20th, plant explorers from the USDA were sent to search globally for new crops that could be farmed in North America. These explorers returned with date palms from North Africa and the Middle East. The explorer, Walter Swingle brought back six medjool date offshoots from a Moroccan oasis; these six offshoot specimens \"account for all the megool dates grown in the US.\"  \nIn 1928, Russ Nicholl (sometimes spelled Nichol) and his family built a roadside shack near Thermal, California. Another news source states that Nichol built his shack in 1919. A few years later, this shack was expanded and named Valerie Jean after Nicholl's daughter. With electricity and refrigeration, the Nicholls were able to offer variations of ingredients blended with their supply of dates. Nichol was reportedly inspired by stories of nomads in the Middle East who he heard \"lived entirely on dates and goat\u2019s milk\".\nIn 1924 Floyd and Bess Shields opened the Shields Date Garden in Indio to compete with the quickly growing date industry in Coachella Valley.\nThe Coachella Valley has numerous date shake shops, many of them are located on Highway 111. The small desert town of Westmoreland, where medjool dates are grown, and Indio, where Shields is located, are known for their date shakes. The drink has been called the \"unofficial drink of the Coachella Valley\" or the \"unofficial drink of Palm Springs.\"\nThey are a popular drink at the Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival and during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.\nBleiberg, Larry (2 May 2018). \"The Worlds Ultimate Milkshake?\".

In Chinese culture, the color red is traditionally used as a symbol of joy and happiness whereas the tortoise symbolizes longevity, power and tenacity.\nAs such, red tortoise cakes are of a high cultural significance and value amongst the Chinese people. They are typically associated with auspicious occasions and are especially prepared during birthdays and religious festivals to symbolize blessings and good fortune.\nChinese New Year is the most important festival in Chinese culture as it represents the start of a new year for everyone where people could reconcile and welcome the new year in hope for peace and prosperity. During this festival, the Chinese people would pray for good fortune and sweets such as rice cakes and red tortoise cakes are offered to the Chinese deities on ritual altars. These ritual offerings are made in the hope that the sweetness from these cakes will leave a sweet taste in the mouths of the deities and they will bless the people with a prosperous year ahead.\nThe Jade Emperor is one of the most important gods in Chinese folklore. He is believed to be the ruler of heaven and his birthday falls on the ninth day of the first lunar month.   To celebrate his birthday, the Chinese people will conduct prayers in his name and prepare food within Chinese temples or Chinese households as ritual offerings. In Chinese culture, red tortoise cakes are considered must-haves amongst the food items that are to be offered to the Jade Emperor on altar tables.\nBecause the number 6 is considered an auspicious number in Chinese culture, red tortoise cakes are placed on the altar table in multiples of six such as 12, 24 or 36 in the hope that he will bless the people with good fortune and prosperity.\nQing Ming Festival is the time for the Chinese to visit the burial grounds of their ancestors to pay their respects. Prayers are conducted to honor the ancestors and food items such as red tortoise cakes are prepared as offerings. However, there is some difference in the red tortoise cakes that are prepared for this occasion. Apart from the usual red tortoise cakes that are prepared in the color red, there are separate red tortoise cakes that are prepared in the colors green or white. The reason for these differences in color between red tortoise cakes is that these colors are of cultural significance to the Chinese people. The color red is representative of the virtuous life led by the ancestors whereas the colors green and white embody the descendants' grief and their hope that their ancestors are coping well in the afterlife.\nQi Xi Festival falls on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month on the Chinese calendar. Also known as the Chinese Valentine's Day, the Qi Xi Festival is traditionally a time for young maidens to make wishes for a good husband. When a teenage girl reaches her sixteenth birthday, red tortoise cakes are prepared within the respective households and then handed out to close friends and neighbors. The symbolic act of handing out red tortoise cakes on this day signifies that one's daughter has reached maturity and is of a marriageable age. However, this practice is seldom carried out these days due to a change in cultural thoughts and beliefs amongst modern Chinese.\nIn Chinese culture, birthdays are of greater significance after one reaches the age of 60.\nRed tortoise cakes are prepared especially for such occasions when celebrating the birthdays of the elders in the family. The number of red tortoise cakes that are prepared corresponds to the age of the elder who is celebrating his or her birthday by an additional twelve. For example, if an elder is celebrating his 65th birthday, there will be 77 red tortoise cakes prepared to celebrate his or her birthday. The cultural significance of preparing these red tortoise cakes is to count one's blessings for having lived thus far and it is hoped that the additional 12 red tortoise cakes would increase one's lifespan, bringing longevity and good fortune in the process.\nAccording to Chinese custom, when a baby turns one month old, a ceremony is held to celebrate his/her first month of life (the Chinese term translates as \"full moon\").\nRed tortoise cakes are traditionally distributed to friends and relatives during this time to symbolize luck, blessings and long life for the child.\nIn Hokkien tradition, the design on top of the \"ang ku kueh\" will signify the sex of the child. A turtle and two marbles is the sign for a boy while a girl is represented by two peaches. Nowadays, to simplify things, a \u2018pointed\u2019 \"ang ku kueh\" signifies a boy while a \u2018flat\u2019 one a girl.  These tortoise cakes are sometimes made larger than usual in the hope that the child will grow up big and",

Eating red tortoise cakes during these times is meant to represent blessings for the child and longevity for the elderly. In modern times, red tortoise cakes continue to be important food items during Chinese festivals in many countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, China and Taiwan and southern Thailand provinces such as Phuket, Phang-Nga and Trang. However, eating red tortoise cakes in these countries is no longer restricted to special occasions for red tortoise cakes are also commercially available in many pastry shops and bakeries.\nThere are two main components in red tortoise cakes, the skin and the filling. The skin is made mostly from glutinous rice flour and sweet potato whereas the fillings are made from precooked ingredients such as mung bean or ground peanuts and sugar. After kneading and molding the ingredients together, the red tortoise cakes are steamed on a piece of banana leaf. In countries such as Singapore and Malaysia, these pastries are popular snack items and are especially popular with children because of their sweet and savory taste. In fact, many bakeries in Singapore have created red tortoise cakes in a variety of assorted flavors, including jelly and red bean, to cater to all tastes and preferences.\nIn Chinese culture, the color red is traditionally used as a symbol of joy and happiness whereas the tortoise symbolizes longevity, power and tenacity.\nAs such, red tortoise cakes are of a high cultural significance and value amongst the Chinese people.

It soon became popular all over the Soviet Union.\nThe cake has become one of the symbols of Kyiv, particularly by its brand name and package, depicting the horse chestnut leaf, the informal coat of arms of Kyiv.\nThe cake has two airy layers of meringue with hazelnuts, chocolate glaze, and a buttercream-like filling.\nOnce confectioners forgot to put some amount of egg-white for the biscuit in a cooler. The next morning the chef Kostyantyn Petrenko, with the help of 17-year-old assistant Nadia Chornohor, in order to hide the mistake of his colleagues, spread frozen cakes with buttercream, strewed with powder, decorated with floral ornaments.\nThe recipe of the Kyiv cake has changed with time: in the 1970s, bakers perfected the process of making egg-white and nut mixture, then started to add hazelnut in cake and began experimenting with peanuts and cashews. However, these expensive nuts increased the cake's cost so the factory returned to using hazelnuts.\nDacquoise\nPavlova\nSans rival\nSpanische Windtorte\n\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 (in Ukrainian).

Fried plantain may be served as a snack, a starter or as a side dish to the main course, such as with Jollof rice, spicy barbecued meat, tomato stew or beans. It is made in different ways: salted or unsalted, cut into \"ears\", \"fingers\", can be diced, or fried whole.\nFried yellow plantains are sweet bananas from Central America and the Caribbean fried in hot oil. They are sometimes eaten with sour cream, ketchup, or a mayonnaise-ketchup mixture.\nAlloco, as it is called in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, is called dodo in Nigeria, missol\u00e8 in Cameroon and makemba in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is a popular West African snack made from fried plantain. It is often served with chili pepper and onions. In Nigeria, it often serves as a side or can be consumed by itself.  \nAlloco is widely considered as fast-food and is sold on the streets of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. An area with many grilled meat and alloco food vendors in the Cocody neighborhood is named Allocodrome, after this dish.\nKelewele is a popular Ghanaian food made of fried plantains seasoned with spices. In English, it is sometimes referred to as hot plantain crisps. In Accra, kelewele is usually sold at night by street vendors and sometimes in the afternoon by the country side women. It can be served with beans stew, peanuts, or alone as a dessert. Kelewele is also a popular choice for dinner.\nOriginally from Ghana, kelewele has been popularized in America by several recipe books (recipezaar, 2009)\nThe plantains are peeled and may be cut into chunks or cubes. Ginger, cayenne pepper, and salt are the typical spices used to make kelewele. Onions, anise, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and chili powder, however, may also be used as spices. Commercial preparations exist that can simplify preparation and offer a standardized taste. For example, the oil should be hot and the plantain should not be too soft or it will absorb too much oil. The plantain should be fried until the sugar in it caramelizes, and produces brown edges on the plantain.\nBanana fritter\nTostones\nChifle\nBanana chip\nVegetable chips\nIsoun, H.O. Anthonio, M.

In Chinese culture, the color red is traditionally used as a symbol of joy and happiness whereas the tortoise symbolizes longevity, power and tenacity.\nAs such, red tortoise cakes are of a high cultural significance and value amongst the Chinese people. They are typically associated with auspicious occasions and are especially prepared during birthdays and religious festivals to symbolize blessings and good fortune.\nChinese New Year is the most important festival in Chinese culture as it represents the start of a new year for everyone where people could reconcile and welcome the new year in hope for peace and prosperity. During this festival, the Chinese people would pray for good fortune and sweets such as rice cakes and red tortoise cakes are offered to the Chinese deities on ritual altars. These ritual offerings are made in the hope that the sweetness from these cakes will leave a sweet taste in the mouths of the deities and they will bless the people with a prosperous year ahead.\nThe Jade Emperor is one of the most important gods in Chinese folklore. He is believed to be the ruler of heaven and his birthday falls on the ninth day of the first lunar month.   To celebrate his birthday, the Chinese people will conduct prayers in his name and prepare food within Chinese temples or Chinese households as ritual offerings. In Chinese culture, red tortoise cakes are considered must-haves amongst the food items that are to be offered to the Jade Emperor on altar tables.\nBecause the number 6 is considered an auspicious number in Chinese culture, red tortoise cakes are placed on the altar table in multiples of six such as 12, 24 or 36 in the hope that he will bless the people with good fortune and prosperity.\nQing Ming Festival is the time for the Chinese to visit the burial grounds of their ancestors to pay their respects. Prayers are conducted to honor the ancestors and food items such as red tortoise cakes are prepared as offerings. However, there is some difference in the red tortoise cakes that are prepared for this occasion. Apart from the usual red tortoise cakes that are prepared in the color red, there are separate red tortoise cakes that are prepared in the colors green or white. The reason for these differences in color between red tortoise cakes is that these colors are of cultural significance to the Chinese people. The color red is representative of the virtuous life led by the ancestors whereas the colors green and white embody the descendants' grief and their hope that their ancestors are coping well in the afterlife.\nQi Xi Festival falls on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month on the Chinese calendar. Also known as the Chinese Valentine's Day, the Qi Xi Festival is traditionally a time for young maidens to make wishes for a good husband. When a teenage girl reaches her sixteenth birthday, red tortoise cakes are prepared within the respective households and then handed out to close friends and neighbors. The symbolic act of handing out red tortoise cakes on this day signifies that one's daughter has reached maturity and is of a marriageable age. However, this practice is seldom carried out these days due to a change in cultural thoughts and beliefs amongst modern Chinese.\nIn Chinese culture, birthdays are of greater significance after one reaches the age of 60.\nRed tortoise cakes are prepared especially for such occasions when celebrating the birthdays of the elders in the family. The number of red tortoise cakes that are prepared corresponds to the age of the elder who is celebrating his or her birthday by an additional twelve. For example, if an elder is celebrating his 65th birthday, there will be 77 red tortoise cakes prepared to celebrate his or her birthday. The cultural significance of preparing these red tortoise cakes is to count one's blessings for having lived thus far and it is hoped that the additional 12 red tortoise cakes would increase one's lifespan, bringing longevity and good fortune in the process.\nAccording to Chinese custom, when a baby turns one month old, a ceremony is held to celebrate his/her first month of life (the Chinese term translates as \"full moon\").\nRed tortoise cakes are traditionally distributed to friends and relatives during this time to symbolize luck, blessings and long life for the child.\nIn Hokkien tradition, the design on top of the \"ang ku kueh\" will signify the sex of the child. A turtle and two marbles is the sign for a boy while a girl is represented by two peaches. Nowadays, to simplify things, a \u2018pointed\u2019 \"ang ku kueh\" signifies a boy while a \u2018flat\u2019 one a girl.  These tortoise cakes are sometimes made larger than usual in the hope that the child will grow up big and",

In countries such as Singapore and Malaysia, these pastries are popular snack items and are especially popular with children because of their sweet and savory taste.

It soon became popular all over the Soviet Union.\nThe cake has become one of the symbols of Kyiv, particularly by its brand name and package, depicting the horse chestnut leaf, the informal coat of arms of Kyiv.\nThe cake has two airy layers of meringue with hazelnuts, chocolate glaze, and a buttercream-like filling.\nOnce confectioners forgot to put some amount of egg-white for the biscuit in a cooler. The next morning the chef Kostyantyn Petrenko, with the help of 17-year-old assistant Nadia Chornohor, in order to hide the mistake of his colleagues, spread frozen cakes with buttercream, strewed with powder, decorated with floral ornaments.\nThe recipe of the Kyiv cake has changed with time: in the 1970s, bakers perfected the process of making egg-white and nut mixture, then started to add hazelnut in cake and began experimenting with peanuts and cashews. However, these expensive nuts increased the cake's cost so the factory returned to using hazelnuts.\nDacquoise\nPavlova\nSans rival\nSpanische Windtorte\n\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 (in Ukrainian).

Papri chat or papri chaat (ISO: p\u0101p\u1e5b\u012b c\u0101\u1e6d) is a popular traditional fast food and street food from the Indian subcontinent, probably in North India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Many various additional dishes throughout India are also referred to as papri chat. Some restaurants in the United States serve the traditional version of the dish.\nPapri refers to the wafers, and the word chaat is derived from Sanskrit verb ca\u1e6d means tasting with a fingertip and represents the sound made; thereby, it refers to several fast food dishes and snacks. Chaat is a thick cream in Hindi. The term also refers to a variety of dishes in India.\nA recipe for papri (as purika) is mentioned  in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.\nPapri chaat is often purveyed and consumed at mobile food stalls in India. In India, it is more popular in the northern region of the country compared to other areas.\nPathak, A. (2015). Secrets From My Indian Family Kitchen. Octopus Books. p.\u00a0Pt-46.

A corn dog (also spelled corndog) is a sausage (usually a hot dog) on a stick that has been coated in a thick layer of cornmeal batter and deep fried. It originated in the United States and is commonly found in American cuisine.\nNewly arrived German immigrants in Texas, who were sausage-makers finding resistance to the sausages they used to make, have been credited with introducing the corn dog to the United States, though the serving stick came later.  A US patent filed in 1927, granted in 1929, for a Combined Dipping, Cooking, and Article Holding Apparatus, describes corn dogs, among other fried food impaled on a stick; it reads in part:\nI have discovered that articles of food such, for instance, as wieners, boiled ham, hard boiled eggs, cheese, sliced peaches, pineapples, bananas and like fruit, and cherries, dates, figs, strawberries, etc., when impaled on sticks and dipped in batter, which includes in its ingredients a self rising flour, and then deep fried in a vegetable oil at a temperature of about 390\u00a0\u00b0F [200\u00a0\u00b0C], the resultant food product on a stick for a handle is a clean, wholesome and tasty refreshment.\nA \"Krusty Korn Dog\" baker machine appeared in the 1926 Albert Pick-Barth wholesale catalog of hotel and restaurant supplies. The 'korn dogs' were baked in a corn batter and resembled ears of corn when cooked.\nA number of current corn dog vendors claim responsibility for the invention and/or popularization of the corn dog. Carl and Neil Fletcher lay such a claim, having introduced their \"Corny Dogs\" at the State Fair of Texas sometime between 1938 and 1942.  The Pronto Pup vendors at the Minnesota State Fair claim to have invented the corn dog in 1941.  Cozy Dog Drive-in, in Springfield, Illinois, claims to have been the first to serve corn dogs on sticks, on June 16, 1946. Also in 1946, Dave Barham opened the first location of Hot Dog on a Stick at Muscle Beach in Santa Monica, California.\nOne cheesy variation is prepared either with melted cheese between the hot dog and the breading or by using a cheese-filled hot dog.\nAnother version is the \"cornbrat\" (or \"corn brat\"), which is a corn dog made with bratwurst instead of a wiener or hot dog. They are also sold using different meats in the dog, such as pork and turkey.\nSmall corn dogs, known as \"corn puppies\", \"mini corn dogs\", or \"corn dog nuggets\", are a variation served in some restaurants, generally on the children's menu or at fast food establishments. A serving includes multiple pieces, usually 10. In contrast to their larger counterparts, corn puppies are normally served stickless as finger food.\nA breakfast version of the corn dog features a breakfast sausage in place of the hot dog, and pancake batter in place of the cornmeal. This variation is commonly called a \"pancake on a stick\". It was formerly served by the drive-in restaurant Sonic, but now is made by companies such as Jimmy Dean.\nBoth vegetarian corn dogs and corn dog nuggets are made as meatless alternatives by many of the same companies that produce vegetarian hot dogs.\n\nIn Argentina, a panchuker (or panchuque, pancho chino) is a hot snack that can be bought near some train stations and in some places of heavy pedestrian transit. They are more popular in the inner country cities. A panchuker consists of a sausage covered with a waffle-like pastry, and has a stick in it (like a corn dog) so that it can be easily consumed. Some versions contain cheese, and sauces may be served to accompany them. Some variations may be found in Uruguay and other South American countries. Generally, panchukers are offered as a low-price fast food and can only be seen at certain provinces of the inner country, like La Plata, Belgrano, Villa Albertina, Cipoletti, and in Buenos Aires they can be found in Barrio Chino. They are particularly popular in the province of Tucum\u00e1n.\nIn Australia, a hot dog sausage on a stick, deep fried in batter, is known as a Dagwood Dog, Pluto Pup, or Dippy Dog, depending on region.  Variants use wheat-based or corn-based batters. These are not to be confused with the Australian battered sav, a saveloy deep fried in a wheat flour-based batter, as used for fish and chips, which generally does not contain cornmeal.\nIn Quebec, a battered hot dog on a stick is called a \"pogo\" and is traditionally eaten with ordinary, yellow mustard, sometimes referred to as \"ballpark mustard\". The rest of Canada refers to them by the non-trademarked term \"corn dog\" It is named after the trademarked name of a Conagra inc. frozen product available in all of the country since the 1960s but whose main market is the province of Quebec.\nA New Zealand Hot Dog is invariably a deep fried battered sausage on a stick that is dipped in tomato ketchup.

Different types of millets (jowar, bajra, nachni) are the more common grains used for making bhakris. These millet bhakris are popular in the Deccan plateau regions of India (Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka) as well as the semi-arid regions of Rajasthan. In the coastal Konkan and Goa regions of western India rice flour is used for making bhakri.\nJowar bhakri - Jowar bhakris are the most common type of bhakri. The dough is prepared by mixing jowar flour with hot water and then flattened by hand.\nBajra bhakri - Bajra bhakris are mainly prepared in winter, especially near the festival of Sankranti. The preparation is similar to jowar bhakris. This is normally consumed with chutney and butter.\nNachni bhakri - Nachni bhakhris, or ragi rottis, are made of red finger millets. They are prepared similar to other bhakris.\nRice bhakri - Rice bhakhris are made of rice flour, prepared similarly to other bhakris. They are common in the Konkan region.\nWheat Bhakri - Wheat bhakris are like wheat rotis, but bigger in size and depth with proportionally more oil.\nPulse Bhakri - Prepared from urad dal or mix flour of urad and jowar, also known as Kalna bhakri. They are very popular in Khandesh region.\nThe dough for bhakri prepared by mixing the flour with small amount of salt in a bowl and knead into a smooth stiff dough, using enough hot water.\nThe dough is split into little balls. The ball is then flattened using one's palms. There are 2 types by which is made. It is either flattened in the plate by palm by pressing or it is made thin by holding the ball in both palms which requires a lot of skill. The tava (pan) is heated and the bhakri is cooked applying little water to the upper surface and spread it all over with the help of the cook's fingers. The other side also cooked on the tava. \nOnce it is prepared, it is roasted in the direct flame on both the sides.\nBhakri is typically served with yogurt, garlic chutney, Pithla, baingan bharta, thecha (chutney made of green chillies and peanuts), preparations of green leafy vegetables and raw onion. In northern parts of Karnataka, it is served with stuffed brinjal curry. In Vidarbha, it is eaten with \"Zunka\"- A coarse and thick variant of \"Pithla.\" It has traditionally been the rural staple which would be carried to the farm at the crack of dawn and make up for both breakfast and lunch. In the fields, bhakri even used to serve as a plate, on which chutney, kharda or thecha was served and eaten together. In Khandesh region, bhakri and shev bhaji (thick savory curry prepared from sev) is a very popular dish. In the coastal regions like Konkan and Goa, the rice flour bhakris are mainly served with fish curry.\nIn modern days, bhakhris have increasingly been replaced by wheat rotis and phulkas but they still retain popularity in many regions and as specialty dishes.\nRoti\nChapati\nParatha\nKulcha\nList of Indian breads\nTaylor Sen, Colleen (2004).

Different types of millets (jowar, bajra, nachni) are the more common grains used for making bhakris. These millet bhakris are popular in the Deccan plateau regions of India (Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka) as well as the semi-arid regions of Rajasthan. In the coastal Konkan and Goa regions of western India rice flour is used for making bhakri.\nJowar bhakri - Jowar bhakris are the most common type of bhakri. The dough is prepared by mixing jowar flour with hot water and then flattened by hand.\nBajra bhakri - Bajra bhakris are mainly prepared in winter, especially near the festival of Sankranti. The preparation is similar to jowar bhakris. This is normally consumed with chutney and butter.\nNachni bhakri - Nachni bhakhris, or ragi rottis, are made of red finger millets. They are prepared similar to other bhakris.\nRice bhakri - Rice bhakhris are made of rice flour, prepared similarly to other bhakris. They are common in the Konkan region.\nWheat Bhakri - Wheat bhakris are like wheat rotis, but bigger in size and depth with proportionally more oil.\nPulse Bhakri - Prepared from urad dal or mix flour of urad and jowar, also known as Kalna bhakri. They are very popular in Khandesh region.\nThe dough for bhakri prepared by mixing the flour with small amount of salt in a bowl and knead into a smooth stiff dough, using enough hot water.\nThe dough is split into little balls. The ball is then flattened using one's palms. There are 2 types by which is made. It is either flattened in the plate by palm by pressing or it is made thin by holding the ball in both palms which requires a lot of skill. The tava (pan) is heated and the bhakri is cooked applying little water to the upper surface and spread it all over with the help of the cook's fingers. The other side also cooked on the tava. \nOnce it is prepared, it is roasted in the direct flame on both the sides.\nBhakri is typically served with yogurt, garlic chutney, Pithla, baingan bharta, thecha (chutney made of green chillies and peanuts), preparations of green leafy vegetables and raw onion. In northern parts of Karnataka, it is served with stuffed brinjal curry. In Vidarbha, it is eaten with \"Zunka\"- A coarse and thick variant of \"Pithla.\" It has traditionally been the rural staple which would be carried to the farm at the crack of dawn and make up for both breakfast and lunch. In the fields, bhakri even used to serve as a plate, on which chutney, kharda or thecha was served and eaten together. In Khandesh region, bhakri and shev bhaji (thick savory curry prepared from sev) is a very popular dish. In the coastal regions like Konkan and Goa, the rice flour bhakris are mainly served with fish curry.\nIn modern days, bhakhris have increasingly been replaced by wheat rotis and phulkas but they still retain popularity in many regions and as specialty dishes.\nRoti\nChapati\nParatha\nKulcha\nList of Indian breads\nTaylor Sen, Colleen (2004).

Poppy seed paste, also known as mohn is a common ingredient in Jewish pastries and desserts, and is made from ground poppy seeds and additional sweeteners. Examples of pastries featuring the filling include mohn kichel, babka, and, most famously, hamantashen. In Jewish cuisine, the filling is traditionally referred to as mohn, the word for poppy in both Yiddish and German. Poppy seed-filled pastries are particularly associated with the holiday of Purim\nPoppy seed paste generally has a very thick, paste-like consistency similar to peanut butter or a thick custard, which can grow hard during cooking. It is typically sweet but has been said to have a subtle bitterness and citrus notes due to the poppy seeds. Sometimes lemon or orange zest is added to further accentuate these notes. As the poppy seeds have been ground to a powdery consistency, they have less of a tendency to get stuck in people's teeth than whole poppy seeds.\nIn Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, there are two main kinds of poppy seed filling used in order to accommodate kosher dietary laws. Dairy mohn, which may contain milk, heavy cream, and/or butter; and which is used in baked goods such as hamantaschen which are made with a dough containing dairy and which will be served with a dairy meal. And pareve (non-dairy) poppy seed filling which typically replaces the milk with water and the butter with margarine or oil, and is used in pastries that are meant to be served with meat meals such as mohn rolls, pareve hamantaschen, etc. Pareve poppy seed filling is also suitable for vegan recipes.\nPoppy seeds were one of the most popular spices in medieval Central Europe, known as mohn in German and Yiddish and m\u00e1k in Hungarian.\nTraditionally, poppy seed filling was almost exclusively prepared at home. Immigrants brought poppy seeds to the United States, with the first recipes for poppy seed cookies attested as early as 1889 in cookbooks published by German-Jewish immigrants. Beginning in the 20th century, various commercially-made canned varieties by brands such as \"Solo\" became available and are still sold online and in grocery stores in areas of the United States with significant Jewish populations such as the Northeast, Southern California, and South Florida. Homemade and premade renditions have significant differences in ingredients, and premade filling is generally dairy-free. Some assert that homemade filling is of superior quality as packaged poppy seed filling often contains ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup, and preservatives.\nPastries featuring poppy seed filling are associated with holidays in several cultures. In Ashkenazi Jewish culture, poppy seed-filled hamantashen (translated as \"Haman's ears\" or \"Haman's pockets\") are a traditional pastry eaten during Purim, and are one of the most well-known uses of poppy seed filling.\nIn Hungary, a Poppy seed roll (Bejgli) is made for Christmas.\n\"poppy seed filling for cookies and pastries\".

The taste of bougatsa varies between regions of Greece. For example, bougatsa in Veria is very sweet and full of cream, while in Thessaloniki it is crunchy and not that sweet.\nThe city of Serres achieved the record for the largest puff pastry on 1 June 2008.

Maple sugar is a traditional sweetener in Canada and the northeastern United States, prepared from the sap of the maple tree (\"maple sap\").\nThree species of maple trees in the genus Acer are predominantly used to produce maple sugar: the sugar maple (A. saccharum), the black maple (A. nigrum), and the red maple (A. rubrum), because of the high sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species. The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of A. saccharum, the sugar maple, by some botanists.  Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavor of the sap.\nA few other species of maple are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple sugar, including the box elder (or Manitoba maple, A. negundo), the silver maple (A. saccharinum), and the bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum). Similar sugars may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.\nIn Canada, maple sugar is one of several maple products manufactured from maple sap or maple syrup, including maple butter and maple taffy. Under the Food and Drugs Act and Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, Canadian regulations require that maple sugar products identify the business identity and country of origin on the retail product label.\nMaple sugar was the preferred form of sugar by First Nations/American Indian peoples as the sugar could easily be transported and lasted a long time. It is called ziinzibaakwad by the Anishinaabeg. Blessing of the Bay, the second ocean-going merchant ship built in the English colonies, carried maple sugar from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to New Amsterdam as early as 1631. French awareness of the process is indicated in at least one engraver's works, those of the mid-18th-century artist Jean-Francois Turpin, the engraver Bernard (including several for Diderot's 1755 Encyclopedie.) and others.\nMaple sugar is used to flavor maple products and as an alternative to cane sugar.\nMaple syrup\nList of foods made from maple\nElliot 2006, pp.\u00a08\u201310.\nCiesla 2002, pp.\u00a037\u201338.\n\"Acer saccharum subsp. nigrum\".

Tchaka or Chaka is a Haitian stew made from hominy, beans, pumpkin (joumou), and meat (usually pork). It is used as an offering to the loa in Haitian Vodou. The nutritious soup is also associated with festivities and family time.\nOther names for the dish are tyaka, chaka, or tiaka depending on the region. Typical of Haitian cuisine, this dish has influences of many different cultures.\nTchaka is relatively simple to make. However, it often requires several hours of preparation to allow flavors to develop and incorporate throughout the soup. Unlike other soups where the ingredients are prepared in the same pot, for tchaka, the ingredients are usually cooked separately before being combined. This is because the different ingredients have different cooking times. The red beans and corn are soaked for several hours. The pork is boiled then grilled in oil. Then the beans, corn, and meat are combined and simmered at low heat for about two hours. The tchaka is simmered to the desired consistency which is usually on the thicker side. Some add pumpkin to the tchaka, where a cooked piece of pumpkin is pureed and added to the other ingredients before simmering. The stew is served hot. It is sometimes served with a pickle on the side.\nSeveral other local variations exist which use beef, mutton, or crab instead of pork. Some recipes use coconut milk which provides a creamy consistency. Some recipes use squash, yam, or malanga.\nTchaka is usually served during special occasions because it requires a relatively long time to prepare. For example, it can be served during family gatherings. It can also be served on November 1 for All Saints\u2019 Day, on May 1 for Labor Day to honor Azakah Medeh, the loa of harvest and agriculture. In Haitian Vodou, tchaka was the favorite dish of this loa.\nTchaka was mentioned in a song by Haitian musician, Sydney Guillaume, when he wrote: \n\u201cChofe dife! Nou pral manje tchaka! Chofe dife, brase mayi, pa bliye tisale, Nou pral manje yon bon tchaka. Nou pral voye monte yon bouyon t\u00e8t chaje\u201d (\u201cLight the fire! We will eat tchaka! Light the fire, mix the corn, don\u2019t forget the salted pork, we will eat a delicious tchaka, we will cook an incredible stew\u201d).\nHaitians oftentimes cook tchaka during school vacations since it is protein-rich and thought to help with children\u2019s growth.\nList of soups\nFoundation, A.R.C.

Sevai (Hindi\u00a0:  \u0938\u0947\u0935\u0908), shavige (Kannada: \u0cb6\u0cbe\u0cb5\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cc6) or santhakai (Kongu Nadu: \u0b9a\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0b95\u0bc8), or Saemia is a type of rice vermicelli popular in northern India as a dessert while popular in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and some parts of Kerala as a snack. While typically made from rice, varieties made out of other food grains like wheat, ragi, and others can also be found. Sevai is a popular dessert in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh as a dessert after dinner.\nSevai is mostly made fresh starting from rice grains. It is also prepared from dried sevai packs (or rice sticks) like the instant ones in the Asian grocery stores. Traditionally, making of sevai at home consists of the following steps (with minor variations based on location and family customs):\nSoaking of parboiled rice in cold water for about 3 hours\nGrinding of soaked rice using a wet grinder into a fine paste\nMaking of dumplings from the rice paste and steaming the chunks (at least three variations are known in this step as follows)\nSaut\u00e9eing the paste into dough, make dumplings (also called kozhukkottais, steam the same on an idli vessel)\npour the paste into moulds of the idli vessel and steam the same\nSaut\u00e9eing the paste into dough, make dumplings, drop the same into boiling water and through cook\nSaut\u00e9eing the paste into dough, make medium-sized balls of the dough and pass it through \"sevai press\" into idli plates and then steam it\nPressing of cooked dumplings into fine strands using a type of sevai press\nSevai is similar to idiyappam, in the ingredients and preparation. Sevai, unlike idiyappam, is typically broken or cut up rather than in piles of noodles. In this way, sevai is treated almost as a substitute for rice. Idiyappam, by contrast, is served almost as a substitute for appam with side dishes like curries or kormas.\nThe press used to make sevai and idiyappam are essentially the same. Sevai is also typically not served with curries other side dishes, but rather mixed with a flavoring like lemon, tamarind paste, coconut, or uddina pudi (a type of powder made from black gram dal in Karnataka). Called shavige in Karnataka, it can also be prepared with cooked vegetables and tempered with spices with a dash of lemon juice.\nSevai is typically served in Tamil Nadu and other South Indian communities as a breakfast or tiffin dish, but also served as a dessert such as payasam when cooked in milk with cardamom or other spices and sugar. The cuisine of Kongu region in Tamilnadu has a variation of this with a name Santhagai and included in wedding ceremony rituals of the region. In the Malnad region of Karnataka, it may be served with chicken curry, rather unlike how it is usually served in other parts of South India. Sankethi communities also differ from the norm in that they prepare idiyappam and serve it like sevai, flavored with lemon, tamarind, or uddina pudi. Other variants of sevai (or idiyappam for that matter) can be made with ragi, jowar, or other grains are served plain with accompaniments like sweetened coconut milk and various edible powders that include powdered chickpea and sesame. In Tamil Nadu santhakai is often flavoured with lemon, tamarind, tomato, coconut, curd etc. and is usually eaten warm.\nIndian cuisine\nhistory of Indian cuisine\nNoodles\nRice vermicelli\nTamil cuisine\nJalebi\nDumpling\n\"History \u2013 National Pasta Association (NPA)\". web.archive.org. 10 June 2021.

B\u00fan ri\u00eau is a traditional Vietnamese soup of clear stock and rice vermicelli. There are several varieties of b\u00fan ri\u00eau, including b\u00fan ri\u00eau cua (minced crab), b\u00fan ri\u00eau c\u00e1 (fish) and b\u00fan ri\u00eau \u1ed1c (snail).\nB\u00fan ri\u00eau cua is served with tomato broth and topped with minced freshwater crab. In this dish, various freshwater paddy crabs are used, including the brown paddy crab found in rice paddies in Vietnam. The crabs are cleaned to remove dirt and sand. Then crabs are pounded together with the shell on into a fine paste. This paste is strained and the crab liquid is a base for the soup along with tomato. The crab residue is used as the basis for crab cakes.

This dish is rich in nutrition: calcium from the ground crab shells, iron from the congealed pig's blood, and vitamins and fiber from the vegetables.\n\"B\u00fan ri\u00eau\" has a fresh sour flavor, so Vietnamese like to enjoy it in summer.

Babi kecap is an Indonesian braised pork with sweet soy sauce (kecap manis). It is a Chinese Indonesian classic, due to its simplicity and popularity among Chinese Indonesian households. It is also popular among non-Muslim Indonesians, such as the Balinese, Batak and Minahasan, and in the Netherlands, where it is known as babi ketjap, owing to colonial ties with Indonesia. In the Netherlands, the dish might also be served within an opulent rijsttafel banquet.\nThe dish is believed to be based on Southern Chinese braised pork in soy sauce. However, it is more Indonesian in nature, because of the mild sweetness introduced by Indonesian kecap manis (sweet soy sauce). It is sometimes prepared with a sweet chili sauce.\nIn Bali, babi kecap is consumed at festivals such as Galungan and Nyepi.\nPork belly is usually the preferred cut of pork meat for babi kecap. However, other cuts of pork meat or offal may also be used in similar soy sauce-based recipes. Derivatives of this recipe which substitute the use of pork belly include sengkel babi kecap, which uses pig trotters, and sekba, which is a Chinese Indonesian pork offal stew that may also include pork liver, nose, tongue, ear, tripe and intestines.\nIt is very similar to another Indonesian favorite called semur daging, although semur is usually made of beef and potatoes with slightly different spices. The chicken variant is called ayam kecap.\nAyam kecap\nBabi hong\nList of stews\nList of pork dishes\nSemur\nShurtleff, W.; Aoyagi, A. (2014).

The common meats used were chicken (fricot au poulet), clams (fricot aux coques), rabbit (fricot au lapin des bois), beef, or pork. When chicken was used, it was traditionally an older chicken, since an egg-laying chicken would have been too precious to cook. This accounts for the long cooking time, as an older chicken would have had tougher meat. In lean times, a meatless fricot would be made. Fricot a la belette was one term for this, which means \"weasel stew\". ...",

Fatoot samneh originated as a way for the Yemenite Jewish community to use and repurpose stale pita bread that would have otherwise been discarded. The Yemenite Jewish community was historically very poor, and most of their meals consisted of various soups and stews. Bread such as pita was very valuable, as was \"samneh\", or clarified butter, and their families were often large and the women of the community traditionally had to make do and cook as many meals as possible from their limited resources to feed their families. Over time fatoot samneh became a popular, and traditional dish among the Yemenite Jews as both a way to use up stale pita bread that was past its prime, as well as a popular breakfast or dinner dish.\nFatoot samneh consists of pita bread or some other flatbread such as saluf, laffa, or malawach, that was often leftover from another use or stale, and has been torn or cut into pieces and fried until crisp in a large amount of samneh (clarified butter), although butter or chicken schmaltz are also sometimes used. The mixture is combined with beaten/scrambled eggs, and cooked together in a manner similar to matzah brei or migas. In Israel it is traditionally topped with honey as a sweet dish, although savory versions also exist and some top it with labneh, tahini, shkug, resek avganiyot (grated tomatoes), among other toppings. Fatoot samneh has been compared by some to various dishes such as matzo brei, and migas, among others.\nFatoot samneh is typically made in the following manner. Stale flatbread is torn into small pieces and fried in a large amount of hot clarified butter, butter (for milchig/dairy variations), or schmaltz (for fleishig/meat variations, until the pita pieces are toasted and become crispy. Several eggs are heated with kosher salt, and added to the fried pita mixture, which is stirred continuously similar to scrambled eggs, until the eggs are set and have been somewhat absorbed by the pita. Once the fatoot samneh is cooked through it is then topped with honey, silan, or a range of other toppings, condiments, and seasonings.\nMarks, Gil. The Encyclopedia of Jewish Food.\nKoenig, Leah.

Haminados typically consists of whole eggs in the shell, which are placed on top of a hamin (a Shabbat stew) in the stewing pot. The eggs are braised over many hours, often overnight and turn brown in the course of all-night cooking. The brown eggs, called haminados (g\u00fcevos haminadavos in Ladino, huevos haminados in Spanish), are shelled before serving and placed on top of the other cooked ingredients. In the Tunisian version, the brown eggs are cooked separately in a metal pot on the all-night stove with water and tea leaves (similar to tea eggs). Haminados can be cooked in this way even if no hamin is prepared. The addition of tea leaves, coffee grinds, or onion skins to the water dyes the shell purple and the white a light brown, giving the egg a smooth creamy texture. In Israel, brown eggs are a popular accompaniment to ful medames (a dish of mashed broad beans) and they may also be served with hummus (a dip of mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini) and in a sabich sandwich.\nHardboiled egg\nHamin\nPoached egg\nSabich\nNathan, Joan.

All the elements of the recipe are present in numerous cookbooks since at least the 16th century, but the exact origin of the mille-feuille is unknown. \nAccording to the Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, mille-feuille recipes from 17th century French and 18th century English cookbooks are a precursor to layer cakes.\nThe earliest mention of the name 'mille-feuille' itself appears in 1733 in an English-language cookbook written by French chef Vincent La Chapelle. The 18th century mille-feuille was served stuffed with jam and marmalade instead of cream.\nIn French, the first mention of the mille-feuille appears a little later, in 1749, in a cookbook by Menon:\nTo make a mille-feuille cake, you take puff pastry, make out of it five cakes of equal size, & of the thickness of two coins, in the last one you shall make a hole in the middle in the shape of a Knight's cross, regarding the size you will base yourself on the dish that you will use for service, bake them in the oven. When they are baked & cooled, stack them one on the other, the one with the hole on top, & jams between every cake, [sentence unclear, maybe referring to covering all sides with jam] & ice them everywhere with white icing so that they appear to be a single piece; you can embellish it with some red currant jelly, candied lemon skins & pistachio, you serve them on a plate.\nThe word 'mille-feuille' is not used again in the recipe books of the 18th century. However, under the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, several of the fanciest Parisian pastry shops appear to have sold the cake. During the 19th century, all recipes describe the cake as filled with jam, with the exception of the 1876 recipe by Urbain Dubois, where it is served with Bavarian cream.\nAccording to Alan Davidson in the Oxford Companion to Food, the invention of the form (but not of the pastry itself) is usually attributed to Szeged, Hungary, where a caramel-coated mille-feuille is called 'Szegediner Torte'.\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry, and two layers of cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re. The top layer is coated with a sprinkling of powdered sugar. In later variations, the top is glazed with icing, in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) strips, and then combed. Today, there are also savory mille-feuille, with cheese and spinach or other savory fillings.\nIt is often layered with fruits, most commonly strawberry and raspberry.\nAccording to La Varenne, it was earlier called g\u00e2teau de mille-feuilles (\"cake of a thousand sheets\"), referring to the many layers of pastry. Using traditional puff pastry, made with six folds of three layers, it has 729 layers; with some modern recipes it may have as many as 2,048.\nSome scholars argue that the Napoleon is a variant of mille-feuille. Napoleon pastry is made with frangipane instead of custard.\nIn Australia, a variant of the mille-feuille is the custard slice, also known as the vanilla slice; colloquially, it is sometimes referred to as a 'snot block' or 'pus pie'. It is made using a gelatin-set cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, and in many cases, passionfruit icing. \"French Vanilla slice\" refers to a similar product without fondant icing. In New Zealand, it is variously known as a 'custard slice', a 'custard square', a 'vanilla slice', or, with passion-fruit icing, a 'passion-fruit slice'.\nA similar local variety is called krempita in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, kremna rezina or krem\u0161nita in Slovenia and Croatia, and kr\u00e9me\u0161 in Slovakia.\nIn Belgium and the Netherlands, the tompouce or tompoes is the equivalent pastry. Several variations exist in Belgium, but in the Netherlands it has achieved an almost iconic status, with very little variation seen in form, size, ingredients and colour (always two layers of pastry, nearly always pink glazing, but orange around national festivities). The cartoon character Tom Puss by Marten Toonder is named after the tompouce.\nIn Canada, mille-feuille is often named g\u00e2teaux Napol\u00e9on, or 'Napoleon slice' in English Canada. It is sold either with custard, whipped cream, or both, between three layers of puff pastry; almond paste is the most common filling. A French Canadian method of making a mille-feuille sees it made with graham crackers instead of puff pastry, with pudding replacing the custard layer.\nIn the German speaking part of Switzerland and also in Austria, it is called Cremeschnitte. In Israel it is known by a variation of that name, kremshnit (\u05e7\u05e8\u05de\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d8).\nIn Greece, the pastry is called \u03bc\u03b9\u03bb\u03c6\u03ad\u03b9\u03b3, a transcription of the word 'mille-feuille' using the Greek alphabet.

The main ingredients are grape must, nuts, and flour. Almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, and chocolate and sometimes raisins are threaded onto a string, dipped in thickened grape juice or fruit juices and dried in the shape of a sausage. The traditional technology of churchkhela in the Kakheti region was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2015.\nChurchkhela and its varieties are popular in several countries besides Georgia, such as Syria \"Aleppo\" as known as zob alkadi \u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0636\u064a, Iran, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Cyprus, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Pakistan and Turkey. In Persian, it's known as \u0628\u0627\u0633\u0644\u0648\u0642 \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0631. In Armenian, Greek, and Turkish it is known as \"sujuk\", which is actually a dry sausage. To distinguish the two, it is sometimes referred to as \"sweet sujukh\" (\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0581\u0580 \u057d\u0578\u0582\u057b\u0578\u0582\u056d, kaghtsr sujukh) in Armenian and cevizli sucuk (\"walnut sujuk\") in Turkish.

A variant of Churchkhela, traditionally called Kelawo, is prepared in the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan. It was locally marketed as Hunza chocolate, but as Kelawo does not contain any cocoa, it is now renamed as Hunza Candy.\nThe Cypriot variety is made by dipping strings of almonds into jelly, called palouzes (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03ad\u03c2).\nChurchkhela is a between-meals snack and is also served as a dessert during New Year and Christmas celebrations.\nTraditionally, in times of war women would send their men Churchkhela to eat at the front, because of its pragmatic size, ability not to mold for long periods of time, and heavy texture that keeps one full.\n\nGozinaki\nList of grape dishes\nPestil\nGoldstein, Darra (1999).

Papri chat or papri chaat (ISO: p\u0101p\u1e5b\u012b c\u0101\u1e6d) is a popular traditional fast food and street food from the Indian subcontinent, probably in North India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Many various additional dishes throughout India are also referred to as papri chat. Some restaurants in the United States serve the traditional version of the dish.\nPapri refers to the wafers, and the word chaat is derived from Sanskrit verb ca\u1e6d means tasting with a fingertip and represents the sound made; thereby, it refers to several fast food dishes and snacks. Chaat is a thick cream in Hindi. The term also refers to a variety of dishes in India.\nA recipe for papri (as purika) is mentioned  in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.\nPapri chaat is often purveyed and consumed at mobile food stalls in India. In India, it is more popular in the northern region of the country compared to other areas.\nPathak, A. (2015). Secrets From My Indian Family Kitchen. Octopus Books. p.\u00a0Pt-46.

Mak\u00f3wki ( MACK-oofky, Silesian: Mak\u014dwki, Lower Silesian: Mohn Klie\u00dfla, German: Mohnpielen, Hungarian: M\u00e1kos guba) is a sweet poppy seed-based bread dessert from Central Europe. The dish is considered traditional in Silesia (southwestern Poland), where it is served almost exclusively on Christmas Eve. It is also popular in other parts of Poland as well as in eastern Germany, Slovakia and in Hungary.\nMak\u00f3wki are also well known in Brandenburg and Berlin under the name Mohnpielen. Theodor Fontane in his travels through the Margraviate of Brandenburg wrote about Mohnpielen and other dishes.\nA similar dish, but with slices of Kifli (Kipferl) in Hungary is called m\u00e1kos guba.\nIn Poland, outside of the Silesia region, the dish is widely known as makie\u0142ki. This is particularly common in Pozna\u0144 and in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Lodz), where Silesian migrants settled during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century.\nSilesian cuisine can be very conservative. The tradition of serving mak\u00f3wki/mohnklie\u00dfla/mohnpielen is well maintained among Silesian peoples and it is difficult to imagine a Silesian Christmas without the dish. By the elders, it would be considered unorthodox to prepare it outside the Christmas\u2014New Year period. Preparing mak\u00f3wki outside Silesia can be difficult due to the unavailability of finely ground poppy seed (a special mill is usually required). In the United States, canned poppy paste is sometimes commercially available and can be used.\nList of desserts\nMohnpielen in books by 1900\nBook from 1836, Mark Brandenburg, Mohnpielen\n1862 book:  Northern Germany, Germanic Mythology, to eat seeded foods (particularly Mohnpielen) to ward off bad spirits during twelve days frost\nBrandenburg Mohnpielen, 1868 book\n1885 book: Mohnpielen], Die Familie Buchholz, Julius Stinde\n1899 book, Mohnpielen Brandenburg Heimatkunde \u2013Regional history\nMark Brandenburg Mohnpielen Georg, Rietschel, 1902 book\nPaul Drechsler, Sitten und Braeuche in Schlesien, in Brandenburg, Mohnpielen 1903 book\nTheodor Fontane, Mohnpielen and other dishes\nhttp://www.niedziela.pl/artykul/102953/nd/Ida-Godne-swieta\nhttp://www.poznan.pl/slownik/ S\u0142ownik gwary miejskiej Poznania\n",

It is rice mixed with minced pork and pork blood, flavored with salt, sugar, a little of garlic, shallot, vegetable oil, and then steamed inside a banana leaf. It is commonly served with fried chopped garlic, fried dried bird chilies, and cucumber.\nIn Northern Thailand, the word kan means 'squeeze' and chin means 'meat'. It is believed to be an origin of a dish name according to the cooking method.\nKhao kan chin was originally a dish from Tai Yai ethnic before widespread to Lanna Kingdom or the Northern Thailand of Thailand. It is sometimes called khao ngiao because in ancient time, Lanna ethnic used to call them \"Ngiao\" which implied to racism, in terms of insincere and tricky people. Therefore, Tai Yai cultures in the Northern Thailand of Thailand compose of the word ngiao in the end of their names. Tai Yai was the only ethnic that consumed rice, apart from other ethnics who preferred sticky rice for the main course. This has made Khao kan chin become one of hardly found Lanna dishes that made with rice.\nIt can be served with fried chopped garlic, fried chopped shallot, fried dried bird chilies, onions, and cucumber.

Recipes often call for lime juice, cilantro, onions, and jalapeos. Some non-traditional recipes may call for sour cream, tomatoes, basil, or peas. Due to the presence of polyphenol oxidase in the cells of avocado, exposure to oxygen in the air causes an enzymatic reaction and develops melanoidin pigment, turning the sauce brown. This result is generally considered unappetizing, and there are several methods (some anecdotal) that are used to counter this effect, such as storing the guacamole in an air-tight container or wrapping tightly in plastic to limit the surface area exposed to the air.",

Guacamole (Spanish:\u00a0[(\u0261)waka\u02c8mole] (listen); (informally shortened to guac in the United States since the 1980s) is an avocado-based dip, spread, or salad first developed in Mexico. In addition to its use in modern Mexican cuisine, it has become part of international and American cuisine as a dip, condiment and salad ingredient.\nThe name comes from Classical Nahuatl \u0101huacam\u014dlli [a\u02d0waka\u02c8mo\u02d0l\u02d0i], which literally translates to 'avocado sauce', from \u0101huacatl [a\u02d0\u02c8wakat\u0361\u026c] 'avocado' + m\u014dlli [\u02c8mo\u02d0l\u02d0i] 'sauce'. In Mexican Spanish, it is pronounced [waka\u02c8mole], in American English, it tends to be pronounced /\u02cc\u0261w\u0251\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8mo\u028ali\u02d0/, and in British English, /\u02cc\u0261w\u0251\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8mo\u028ale\u026a/.\nAvocados were first cultivated in South Central Mexico around 10,000 years ago. In the early 1900s, avocados frequently went by the name alligator pear.  In the 1697 book, A New Voyage Round the World, the first known description of a guacamole recipe (though not known by that name) was by English privateer and naturalist William Dampier, who in his visit to Central America during one of his circumnavigations, noted a native preparation made of grinding together avocados, sugar, and lime juice.\nGuacamole has increased avocado sales in the U.S., especially on Super Bowl Sunday and Cinco de Mayo. The rising consumption of guacamole is most likely due to the U.S. government lifting a ban on avocado imports in the 1990s and the growth of the U.S. Latino population.\nAs the major ingredient of guacamole is raw avocado, the nutritional value of the dish derives from avocado vitamins, minerals and fats, providing dietary fiber, several B vitamins, vitamin K, vitamin E and potassium in significant content (see Daily Value percentages in nutrient table for avocado). Avocados are a source of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and phytosterols, such as beta-sitosterol. They also contain carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, zeaxanthin and lutein.\n\nMantequilla de pobre (Spanish for '\"poor-man's butter\"') is a mixture of avocado, tomato, oil, and citrus juice. Despite its name, it predates the arrival of dairy cattle in the Americas, and thus was not originally made as a butter substitute.\nThinner and more acidic, or thick and chunky, guasacaca is a Venezuelan avocado-based sauce; it is made with vinegar, and is served over parrillas (grilled food), arepas, empanadas, and various other dishes. It is common to make the guasacaca with a little hot sauce instead of jalape\u00f1o, but like a guacamole, it is not usually served as a hot sauce itself. Pronounced \"wasakaka\" in Latin America.\nPrepared guacamoles are available in stores, often available refrigerated, frozen or in high pressure packaging which pasteurizes and extends shelf life if products are maintained at 1 to 4\u00a0\u00b0C (34 to 40\u00a0\u00b0F).\nNational Guacamole Day is celebrated on the same day as Mexican Independence Day, September 16.\nOn April 6, 2018, Junta Local de Sanidad Vegetal de Tanc\u00edtaro, Mexico, achieved the Guinness World Records for the largest serving of guacamole. They created it as part of Tanc\u00edtaro's 7th Annual Avocado Festival in Tanc\u00edtaro, Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. The serving weighed 3,788\u00a0kg (8,351 lb) and had more than 350 people help prepare it.\nAvocado sauce\nList of avocado dishes\nList of dips\nList of condiments\nList of Mexican dishes\nMole sauce\nSalsa (sauce)\n\"Oxford Dictionary\".

Sayur lodeh is an Indonesian vegetable soup prepared from vegetables in coconut milk popular in Indonesia, but most often associated with Javanese cuisine.\nThe origin of the dish can be traced to the Javanese people's tradition of Java. According to Javanese Kejawen beliefs, sayur lodeh is an essential part of the slametan ceremony and it is believed as tolak bala, to ward off possible danger and disaster. The people and the Keraton (court) of Yogyakarta often communally cook sayur lodeh for the slametan ceremony. It is believed this can deter disasters such as wind storm, earthquake, volcanic eruption, drought and plague. It is well known in Javanese cuisine and has spread throughout Indonesia and the region. Because of Javanese migration to neighboring countries, today sayur lodeh is also popular in Malaysia and Singapore.\nSayur lodeh can be served with steamed rice (separated or mixed in one plate), or with sliced lontong rice cake. Although sayur lodeh basically is a vegetarian dish, it is popularly consumed with ikan asin (salted fish), opor ayam, empal gepuk or beef serundeng. Sambal terasi (\"shrimp paste chili sauce\") is usually served separately.\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, when sayur lodeh is served with lontong (nasi himpit), it is known as lontong. Dried squid sambal, boiled egg and coconut serunding are often added to lontong.\nSayur asem, similar ingredients, but tamarind-based soup\nCoconut soup\nList of Indonesian soups\nList of vegetable soups\nShurtleff, W.; Aoyagi, A.

Peanut sauce, satay sauce, bumbu kacang, sambal kacang, or  pecel  is an Indonesian sauce made from ground roasted or fried peanuts, widely used in cuisines worldwide.\nPeanut sauce is used with meat and vegetables, adding flavor to grilled skewered meat, such as satays, poured over vegetables as salad dressing such as in gado-gado, or as a dipping sauce.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of Indonesian cuisine is the wide applications of bumbu kacang (peanut sauce) in many Indonesian signature dishes, such as satay, gado-gado, karedok, ketoprak, rujak and pecel. It is usually added to main ingredients (meat or vegetable) to add taste, used as dipping sauce such as sambal kacang (a mixture of ground chilli and fried peanuts) for otak-otak or ketan or as a dressing on vegetables. Satays are commonly served with peanut sauce. However, satay doesn't actually mean peanut sauce \u2013 Southeast Asia\u2019s favourite street food snack is a dish of skewered, grilled meat with infinite variations.\nIntroduced from Mexico by Portuguese and Spanish merchants in the 16th century, peanuts found a place within Indonesian cuisine as a popular sauce. Peanuts thrived in the tropical environment of Southeast Asia, and today, they can be found roasted and chopped finely, topping a variety of dishes and in marinades and dipping sauces.\nPeanut sauce reached its sophistication in Indonesia, with the delicate balance of taste acquired from various ingredients according to each recipe of peanut sauce; fried peanuts, gula jawa (palm sugar), garlic, shallot, ginger, tamarind, lemon juice, lemongrass, salt, chilli, pepper, sweet soy sauce, ground together and mixed with water to acquire the  right texture. The secret to good peanut sauce is \"not too thick and not too watery.\" Indonesian peanut sauce tends to be less sweet than the Thai one (which is a hybrid adaptation). Gado-gado is eaten with peanut sauce throughout Indonesia showcasing the delicate balance of sweet, spicy and sour.\nThe Netherlands adopted peanut sauce as a common side dish through its former colonization of South East Asia. Besides being used in certain traditional Indonesian and Dutch-Indonesian dishes, it has found its way in to a purely Dutch context when it is eaten during, for instance, a (non Asian style) barbecue or with French fries. A popular combination at Dutch fast food outlets is French fries with mayonnaise and peanut sauce (often with raw chopped onions and with ketchup or Dutch currysauce), called a Frietje Oorlog (lit. \"Fries War\"). Peanut sauce is also eaten with baguette, bread, cucumber or potatoes. It is also used as an ingredient in the deep-fried snack food called Sat\u00e9kroket, a croquette made with a flour-thickened ragout based on Indonesian satay.\nIn Chinese cooking, the sauce is often used on grilled meat. Other uses include hot pot and dan dan noodles.\nIn India, groundnut chutney (spicy peanut sauce) is served along with breakfast, such as idli and dosa. Variations include palli chutney (spiced whole peanut chutney) in Andhra Pradesh and kadalai chutney in Tamil Nadu.\nIn the Philippines, peanut sauce is known as sarsa ng mani and is used as a dipping sauce for satay and for different varieties of lumpia.\nIn Singapore, peanut sauce is not only used as dipping sauce for satay. It is also eaten with rice vermicelli known as satay bee hoon.\nIn Vietnam, it is called t\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0111\u1eadu ph\u1ed9ng and is used in cu\u1ed1n di\u1ebfp dish.\nList of peanut dishes\nList of sauces\nPeanut butter\nPeanut chutney\nSambal\nShacha sauce\nSiu haau sauce\nBartholomeusz, Rachel. \"So much more to satay than peanut sauce\".

Clams casino is a clam \"on the halfshell\" dish with breadcrumbs and bacon. Green peppers are also a common ingredient.\nIt originated in Rhode Island in the United States. It is often served as an appetizer in New England and is served in variations nationally.\nThe clams, bacon, and other ingredients are cooked in various ways depending on the recipe, and then added with breading to half the clam shell and baked or broiled (grilled from above) to a golden brown.\nThere are many variations on the dish, but the constant factor is the bacon: \"Bacon remains the major key to its success\", with some chefs recommending smoked bacon for its salty flavor and others advocating an unsmoked variety.\nAccording to legend, the recipe for clams casino was originally developed in 1917 in the Little Casino in Narragansett, Rhode Island, by a ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel for a woman of means wanting something special for her guests. Good Housekeeping Great American Classics attributes the dish to Mrs. Paran Stevens and ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel Julius Keller. She named the dish after the hotel, and word and popularity of the dish has since spread across the United States, including New Orleans, where oysters are substituted for clams. Clams casino remains a very popular dish in Rhode Island, \"appearing on almost every menu\".\nThe Central Park Casino was offering \"soft clams a la Casino\" as early as 1900.\nAccording to Merrill Shindler, \"in the first decades of this century [the 20th], if a restaurant wanted to be noted, it came up with a dish that involved the baking of shellfish\". While there was a profusion of this type of menu offering (often with the meat taken out of the shell, prepared with sauce, and returned to the shell), clams casino and oysters Rockefeller \"are among the few surviving dishes from the shellfish fad\".\nThe dish is popular with Italian-Americans, having \"a permanent spot on just about every trattoria menu\" in Little Italy, Manhattan, and is considered an American classic. Clams casino is often served at Italian festivals and during the holidays in the United States.\nClams oreganata\nList of bacon dishes\nList of clam dishes\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nList of seafood dishes\nRuth Reichl, John Willoughby, Zanne Early Stewart The Gourmet Cookbook: More Than 1000 Recipes Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2006 ISBN\u00a00-618-80692-X, 9780618806928\n1056 pages page 50 The Gourmet Cookbook\nZanger, Mark H.

Spatini spaghetti sauce is an American tomato sauce mix with a flavor profile built upon oregano, thyme, pepper, onion, garlic, and other natural flavors.  The sauce mix was manufactured and distributed originally by Spatini Co., subsequently by Unilever and its subsidiary Lipton, and at present by Lawry's.\nSpatini spaghetti sauce mix was originally developed and marketed by Russell G. Lakoff and Harry Seidman of Overbrook Hills, Pennsylvania, who registered their business in Philadelphia as Spatini Co. on September 4, 1952, selling the dry powdered mix packaged in boxes of three packets. It was manufactured in Philadelphia until 1976, when the private company was sold to Lipton.  At that point the Spatini Company was moved to Lipton headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.  The Spatini Co. also manufactured a brown gravy mix that was sold under the Spatini brand.  In 1962, Spatini spaghetti sauce added a version with tomatoes already included.\nLipton, a subsidiary of Unilever, purchased Spatini Co. in 1976, and took over the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix.  Unilever shifted Spatini spaghetti sauce mix from Lipton to its subsidiary Lawry's line in the mid-1980s, and Lawry's continued to promote and sell Spatini spaghetti sauce mix for home consumers, as new recipes using the mix were introduced for commercial users.\nRetail manufacturing of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix for home consumers ended in January 2007, but it continues to be manufactured and distributed commercially for restaurant and institutional use by Lawry's, which was sold by Unilever to McCormick & Company in 2008.\nThe commercial version of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix lists a serving size of two teaspoons or six grams, which seasons a half cup when prepared.  One serving contains 20 calories, 620 milligrams of sodium (26% Daily Value), 2 grams of sugars, 4 grams of carbohydrates (1% Daily Value), with no fat, protein, cholesterol, or fiber.\nSpatini spaghetti sauce began to emphasize television advertising in 1964, when the company shifted its advertising agency from Weightman, Inc., to Firestone-Rosen, Inc.  Because Firestone-Rosen had conflicting assignments from the Ronzoni company, Spatini moved its account to Ron Bloomberg Advertising in 1969, after which Spatini was advertised on broadcast media by singing the words \"Spatini spaghetti sauce\" to the tune of \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" from the opera Rigoletto.\nWilbur, Todd (2009).

Today, however, many kinds of crispbread contain wheat flour, spices and grains, and are often leavened with yeast or sourdough, and milk or sesame seeds can be added. In the case of unleavened crispbread, bubbles are introduced into the dough mechanically. Traditionally, this was done by mixing snow or powdered ice into the dough, which then evaporated during baking. Today, the dough, which must contain a large amount of water, is cooled and mixed until bubbly. Another method is to knead the dough under pressure in an extruder. The sudden drop in pressure then causes water to evaporate, creating bubbles in the dough. ...",

Crispbreads are lightweight and keep fresh for a very long time due to their lack of water. Crispbread is a staple food and was for a long time considered a poor man's diet. However, in recent years there has been renewed interest in crispbread in the Nordic countries.\nFinland and Sweden have long traditions in crispbread consumption. The origin of the crispbread came from the earlier spisbr\u00f6d (stovebread) which was a similar but thicker kind of bread. These breads were baked from at least the 6th century in central Sweden. They were usually hung above the stove to be dried. Traditional crispbread in Sweden and western Finnish is made in  this tradition with the form of a round flat loaf with a hole in the middle to facilitate storage on long poles hanging near the ceiling. Traditionally, crispbreads were baked just twice a year: following harvest and again in the spring when frozen river waters began to flow. The slim crispbread that is common today originated in eastern V\u00e4rmland. Sweden's first industrial crispbread bakery, AU Bergmans enka, began its production in Stockholm in 1850. Rectangular Kn\u00e4ckebrot was first manufactured in Germany in 1927 and has remained popular and readily available there ever since.\nCrispbread itself is very dry and therefore served with a spread, like butter, and optional toppings. Crispbread is usually a part of a daily meal. In Sweden and Finland crispbread and butter or margarine are included in school meals. Crispbread might also be crushed into yogurt or filmj\u00f6lk in place of cereals or muesli, and even used as a pizza base.\nBublik\nDorset knob\nFlatbread\nFlatbr\u00f8d\nHardtack\nLavash\nMatzo\nRyvita, a brand of crispbread\nTunnbr\u00f6d\nWasabr\u00f6d, a Swedish company\nCRISPBREAD\nMedeltida tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rdsv\u00e4xter: Att sp\u00e5ra det f\u00f6rflutna Archived 2009-02-25 at the Wayback Machine\nJan-\u00d6jvind Swahn (2003).

A bouillon cube /\u02c8bu\u02d0j\u0252n/ (Canada and US),  stock cube (Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and UK), broth cube (Asia) or stock pot (UK) is dehydrated broth or stock formed into a small cube about 13\u00a0mm (1\u20442\u00a0in) wide. It is typically made from dehydrated vegetables, meat stock, a small portion of fat, MSG, salt, and seasonings, shaped into a small cube. Vegetarian and vegan types are also made. Bouillon is also available in granular, powdered, liquid, and paste forms.\nDehydrated meat stock, in the form of tablets, was known in the 17th century to English food writer Anne Blencowe, who died in 1718, and elsewhere as early as 1735. Various French cooks in the early 19th century (Lefesse, Massu\u00e9, and Martin) tried to patent bouillon cubes and tablets, but were turned down for lack of originality. Nicolas Appert also proposed such dehydrated bouillon in 1831.\nPortable soup was a kind of dehydrated food used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a precursor of meat extract and bouillon cubes, and of industrially dehydrated food. It is also known as pocket soup or veal glue. It is a cousin of the glace de viande of French cooking. It was long a staple of seamen and explorers, for it would keep for many months or even years. In this context, it was a filling and nutritious dish. Portable soup of less extended vintage was, according to the 1881 Household Cyclopedia,\n\"exceedingly convenient for private families, for by putting one of the cakes in a saucepan with about a quart of water, and a little salt, a basin of good broth may be made in a few minutes.\"\nIn the mid-19th century, German chemist Justus von Liebig developed meat extract, but it was more expensive than bouillon cubes.\nThe invention of the bouillon cube is also attributed to Auguste Escoffier, one of the most accomplished French chefs of his time, who also pioneered many other advances in food preservation, such as the canning of tomatoes and vegetables.\nIndustrially produced bouillon cubes were commercialized by Maggi in 1908, by Oxo in 1910, and by Knorr in 1912. By 1913, at least 10 brands were available, with salt contents of 59\u201372%.\nContrary to popular belief, stock cubes are not made by \"drying out stock\", but by mixing already dry ingredients into a paste. The ingredients are usually mixed in a container (batch mixing), left to mature, and then shaped into the cube form. Alternatively, they can be mixed directly into an extruder.\nList of dried foods\nPortable soup\nJoan Thirsk, \u2018Blencowe , Anne, Lady Blencowe (1656\u20131718)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2005; online edn, Jan 2007 accessed 17 Nov 2016\nVincent La Chapelle, Le cuisinier moderne, as cited in Davis\nJennifer Davis, Defining Culinary Authority: The Transformation of Cooking in France, 1650-1830, Louisiana State University Press, 2013, p. 154f\n\"Culinary Arts: Plain Cookery\", Household Cyclopedia Archived 2013-03-28 at the Wayback Machine, 1881.\nAuguste Escoffier: Founder of Modern Cuisine; online https://www.iwfs.org/americas/wine-food---friends-1/articles/auguste-escoffier--founder-of-modern-cuisine\nCook, F.

Spatini spaghetti sauce is an American tomato sauce mix with a flavor profile built upon oregano, thyme, pepper, onion, garlic, and other natural flavors.  The sauce mix was manufactured and distributed originally by Spatini Co., subsequently by Unilever and its subsidiary Lipton, and at present by Lawry's.\nSpatini spaghetti sauce mix was originally developed and marketed by Russell G. Lakoff and Harry Seidman of Overbrook Hills, Pennsylvania, who registered their business in Philadelphia as Spatini Co. on September 4, 1952, selling the dry powdered mix packaged in boxes of three packets. It was manufactured in Philadelphia until 1976, when the private company was sold to Lipton.  At that point the Spatini Company was moved to Lipton headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.  The Spatini Co. also manufactured a brown gravy mix that was sold under the Spatini brand.  In 1962, Spatini spaghetti sauce added a version with tomatoes already included.\nLipton, a subsidiary of Unilever, purchased Spatini Co. in 1976, and took over the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix.  Unilever shifted Spatini spaghetti sauce mix from Lipton to its subsidiary Lawry's line in the mid-1980s, and Lawry's continued to promote and sell Spatini spaghetti sauce mix for home consumers, as new recipes using the mix were introduced for commercial users.\nRetail manufacturing of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix for home consumers ended in January 2007, but it continues to be manufactured and distributed commercially for restaurant and institutional use by Lawry's, which was sold by Unilever to McCormick & Company in 2008.\nThe commercial version of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix lists a serving size of two teaspoons or six grams, which seasons a half cup when prepared.  One serving contains 20 calories, 620 milligrams of sodium (26% Daily Value), 2 grams of sugars, 4 grams of carbohydrates (1% Daily Value), with no fat, protein, cholesterol, or fiber.\nSpatini spaghetti sauce began to emphasize television advertising in 1964, when the company shifted its advertising agency from Weightman, Inc., to Firestone-Rosen, Inc.  Because Firestone-Rosen had conflicting assignments from the Ronzoni company, Spatini moved its account to Ron Bloomberg Advertising in 1969, after which Spatini was advertised on broadcast media by singing the words \"Spatini spaghetti sauce\" to the tune of \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" from the opera Rigoletto.\nWilbur, Todd (2009).

The pizza includes lobster, caviar, tiger prawns and smoked salmon. Each slice is worth C$85, because it is divided into 10 slices. It has to be pre-ordered one day in advance. The title for world's most expensive pizza was previously held by a C$178 pizza prepared with white truffle by Gordon Ramsay. As of September 2014, Guinness World Records still lists the Gordon Ramsay pizza on their website.\nThere are several instances of more expensive pizzas, such as the US$4,200 \u201cPizza Royale 007\" at Haggis restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland, which has caviar, lobster and is topped with 24-carat gold leaf, and the US$1,000 caviar pizza made by Nino's Bellissima pizzeria in New York City, New York.

The Spatini Co. also manufactured a brown gravy mix that was sold under the Spatini brand.  In 1962, Spatini spaghetti sauce added a version with tomatoes already included.\nLipton, a subsidiary of Unilever, purchased Spatini Co. in 1976, and took over the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix.  Unilever shifted Spatini spaghetti sauce mix from Lipton to its subsidiary Lawry's line in the mid-1980s, and Lawry's continued to promote and sell Spatini spaghetti sauce mix for home consumers, as new recipes using the mix were introduced for commercial users.\nRetail manufacturing of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix for home consumers ended in January 2007, but it continues to be manufactured and distributed commercially for restaurant and institutional use by Lawry's, which was sold by Unilever to McCormick & Company in 2008.\nThe commercial version of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix lists a serving size of two teaspoons or six grams, which seasons a half cup when prepared.  One serving contains 20 calories, 620 milligrams of sodium (26% Daily Value), 2 grams of sugars, 4 grams of carbohydrates (1% Daily Value), with no fat, protein, cholesterol, or fiber.\nSpatini spaghetti sauce began to emphasize television advertising in 1964, when the company shifted its advertising agency from Weightman, Inc., to Firestone-Rosen, Inc.  Because Firestone-Rosen had conflicting assignments from the Ronzoni company, Spatini moved its account to Ron Bloomberg Advertising in 1969, after which Spatini was advertised on broadcast media by singing the words \"Spatini spaghetti sauce\" to the tune of \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" from the opera Rigoletto.\nWilbur, Todd (2009).

It is commonly sold in the UK as special fried rice and in the US as house special fried rice.\nYangzhou fried rice is a perhaps the most well-known dish of the city of Yangzhou, Jiangsu province. The recipe was invented by Qing China's Yi Bingshou (1754\u20131815) and the dish was named Yangzhou fried rice since Yi was once the regional magistrate of Yangzhou. It is often served with thousand fish soup. There are two ways of cooking the dish in terms of the preparation of the egg scrambled. The first variation is known as \"silver covered gold\", in which the egg is scrambled separately before mixing with the rice. The alternative \"gold covered silver\" method is described as pouring the liquid egg over the rice and vegetables mix and frying the two together. Various traditions call for a rice\u2013egg ratio of 5:1 or 3:1.\nIn October 2015, as part of the 2,500th anniversary of the town of Yangzhou, an attempt was made in Yangzhou at beating the previous world record for fried rice set in 2014 by the Turkey culinary federation. The attempt, made by the World Association of Chinese Cuisine resulted in 4,192 kilograms (9,242\u00a0lb) of Yangzhou fried rice being produced by a team of 300 cooks. The organizers initially planned to send the end product to five companies for consumption by their staff. However, about 150 kilograms (330\u00a0lb) of it ended up as pig swill, as it had been cooked for four hours and was felt unsuitable for human consumption. As per the organizers' intents, the rest was sent to local canteens. However, due to a part of it being sent to feed animals, the world record attempt was disqualified, as a Guinness World Records spokesman said that it had become obvious that the dish was not fit for human consumption.\nList of Chinese dishes\nList of fried rice dishes\nDunlop, Fuchsia (20 May 2013). \"Yangzhou Fried Rice\".

Spatini spaghetti sauce is an American tomato sauce mix with a flavor profile built upon oregano, thyme, pepper, onion, garlic, and other natural flavors.  The sauce mix was manufactured and distributed originally by Spatini Co., subsequently by Unilever and its subsidiary Lipton, and at present by Lawry's.\nSpatini spaghetti sauce mix was originally developed and marketed by Russell G. Lakoff and Harry Seidman of Overbrook Hills, Pennsylvania, who registered their business in Philadelphia as Spatini Co. on September 4, 1952, selling the dry powdered mix packaged in boxes of three packets. It was manufactured in Philadelphia until 1976, when the private company was sold to Lipton.  At that point the Spatini Company was moved to Lipton headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.  The Spatini Co. also manufactured a brown gravy mix that was sold under the Spatini brand.  In 1962, Spatini spaghetti sauce added a version with tomatoes already included.\nLipton, a subsidiary of Unilever, purchased Spatini Co. in 1976, and took over the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix.  Unilever shifted Spatini spaghetti sauce mix from Lipton to its subsidiary Lawry's line in the mid-1980s, and Lawry's continued to promote and sell Spatini spaghetti sauce mix for home consumers, as new recipes using the mix were introduced for commercial users.\nRetail manufacturing of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix for home consumers ended in January 2007, but it continues to be manufactured and distributed commercially for restaurant and institutional use by Lawry's, which was sold by Unilever to McCormick & Company in 2008.\nThe commercial version of Spatini spaghetti sauce mix lists a serving size of two teaspoons or six grams, which seasons a half cup when prepared.  One serving contains 20 calories, 620 milligrams of sodium (26% Daily Value), 2 grams of sugars, 4 grams of carbohydrates (1% Daily Value), with no fat, protein, cholesterol, or fiber.\nSpatini spaghetti sauce began to emphasize television advertising in 1964, when the company shifted its advertising agency from Weightman, Inc., to Firestone-Rosen, Inc.  Because Firestone-Rosen had conflicting assignments from the Ronzoni company, Spatini moved its account to Ron Bloomberg Advertising in 1969, after which Spatini was advertised on broadcast media by singing the words \"Spatini spaghetti sauce\" to the tune of \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" from the opera Rigoletto.\nWilbur, Todd (2009).

The origin of bubur ayam was derived from Chinese chicken congee. The traces of Chinese cuisine influences are the use of cakwe (youtiao), tongcay and soy sauce. Bubur ayam employs a wide range of poultry products, such as shredded chicken meat for the main dish and different dishes made with chicken offal as side delicacies. Bubur ayam is often eaten with the addition of boiled chicken egg, chicken liver, gizzard, intestines and uritan (premature chicken eggs acquired from butchered hens), served as satay. There are some variants of bubur ayam, such as bubur ayam Bandung and bubur ayam Sukabumi, both from West Java. The later variant uses raw telur ayam kampung (lit. \"village chicken egg\", i.e. free-range eggs) buried under the hot rice congee to allow the egg to be half-cooked, with the other ingredients on top of the rice congee. The recipe and condiments of bubur ayam served by travelling vendors and warung are also slightly different with those served in fast food establishments or hotel restaurants.\nBecause this food is always served hot and with a soft texture, like soto ayam and nasi tim, bubur ayam is known as comfort food in Indonesian culture. The soft texture of the rice congee and boneless chicken also makes this dish suitable for young children or adults in convalescence. Because of its popularity, bubur ayam has become one of the Asia-inspired fast food menu items at McDonald's Indonesia and Malaysia, and also at Kentucky Fried Chicken Indonesia. Although almost all recipes of bubur ayam use rice, a new variation, called bubur ayam havermut, replaces rice with oats. In grocery stores, bubur ayam is also available as instant food, requiring only the addition of hot water.\n\nArroz caldo\nList of porridges\nKraig, Bruce; Sen, Colleen Taylor, eds. (2013).

The traditional version of cashew chicken is stir-fried in a wok.  Tender chunks of chicken are combined with crispy roasted cashews, vegetables and are tossed in a light sauce made from garlic, soy sauce and hoisin sauce, thinned with water.\nThe deep-fried version of the dish is closely associated with the city of Springfield, Missouri. Deep-fried cashew chicken was apparently first served in 1963 at the Grove Supper Club in Springfield.  David Leong (1920\u20132020), a chef who moved to the United States from China in 1940, struggled to gain acceptance for the foods of his homeland so he began searching for a dish that would appeal to local residents' tastes. His famous deep-fried cashew chicken recipe was so popular he soon opened Leong's Tea House in Springfield.   The dish became exceedingly popular in the Springfield area and is often cited as the unofficial \"dish of the city\". Springfield even hosts an annual festival that is centered on this chicken dish: Springfield Sertoma's Cashew Craze.\nBorrowing from the local love of fried chicken, Leong came up with a variation of the preexisting dish. Instead of stir-frying the chicken, as is normally done, he deep-fried the chicken chunks. He then covered them with the typical sauce made from chicken stock, soy sauce and oyster sauce, and added the handful of cashews. He also included chopped green onions as a twist and it became an immediate hit with the local crowd. As word spread about the dish, so did the recipe. Leong's Tea House closed its doors in 1997, but Springfield-style cashew chicken is still being served at over 70 Chinese restaurants, as well as many non-Chinese restaurants, in and around the Springfield metropolitan area, and elsewhere in Missouri and other states.  Springfield-style cashew chicken has been mentioned on The Food Channel, a nationwide syndicated radio program, and the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nIn 2010, Leong's son, with his father's assistance, opened a new restaurant in Springfield serving the same style of cashew chicken.\nLeong died at the age of 99 on July 21, 2020.\nIn Thai cuisine, there is a related stir-fry dish called kai pad med mamuang himmapan or gai pad med ma muang.\nIn Haitian cuisine, there is an unrelated chicken stew with cashews called poul ak nwa.\nChop suey\nGeneral Tso's chicken\nKung Pao chicken\nList of deep fried foods\nMapo doufu\n\u00a0Food portal\nSegal, Jennifer (March 2010). \"Cashew Chicken\".

It has many names and is prepared in various ways.\nThe English name, bottarga, was borrowed from Italian. The Italian form is thought to have been introduced from the Arabic 'bu\u1e6dar\u1e2bah' (\u0628\u0637\u0627\u0631\u062e\u0629), plural form 'bu\u1e6dari\u1e2b' (\u0628\u0637\u0627\u0631\u062e), itself from Byzantine Greek '\u1fa0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd' ('oiot\u00e1rikhon'), a combination of the words '\u1fa0\u03cc\u03bd' ('egg') and '\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd' ('pickled').\nThe Italian form can be dated to c. 1500, as the Greek form of the word, when transliterated into Latin as 'ova tarycha', occurs in Bartolomeo Platina's De Honesta Voluptate (c. 1474), the earliest printed cookbook. In an Italian manuscript that \"closely parallels\" Platina's cookbook and dated to shortly after its publication, 'botarghe' is attested in the corresponding passage.\nThe first mention of the Greek form ('oiot\u00e1rikhon') occurs in the 11th century, in the writings of Simeon Seth, who denounced the food as something to be \"avoided totally\", although a similar phrase may have been in use since antiquity in the same denotation.\nIt has been suggested that the Coptic outarakhon may be an intermediate form between the Greek and Arabic, whereas examination of dialectical variants of the Greek '\u1fa0\u03cc\u03bd' 'egg' include the Pontic Greek '\u1f60\u03b2\u03cc\u03bd' (traditionally where the mullets are caught), and '\u1f40\u03b2\u03cc' or '\u03b2\u03cc' in parts of Asia Minor. The modern Greek name comes from the Byzantine Greek, substituting the modern word '\u03b1\u03c5\u03b3\u03cc' for the ancient word '\u1fa0\u00f3\u03bd'.\nBottarga production is first documented in the Nile Delta in the 10th century BCE.\nIn the 15th century, Martino da Como describes the production of bottarga by salting then smoking to dry it.\n\nIn Croatia, the delicacy is known as butarga or butarda. It is usually fried before serving.\nOrange and molded in wax, Tunisian boutarga is made from mullet eggs and is known as a sought-after product.\nBottarga is produced in the Port Said area. It is commonly pronounced Batarekh all over Egypt.\nThe usual French name is boutargue; in Provence, it is called poutargue and is produced in the city of Martigues.\nIn Greece, it is called avgotaraxo or avgotaracho (Greek: \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf-\u03b1\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf) and is produced primarily from the flathead mullet caught in Greek lagoons. The whole mature ovaries are removed from the fish, washed with water, salted with natural sea salt, dried under the sun, and sealed in melted beeswax.\nAvgotaracho Messolonghiou, made from fish caught in the Messolonghi-Etoliko Lagoons, is a European and Greek protected designation of origin, one of the few seafood products with a PDO.\nIn Italy, it is made from bluefin tuna in Sicily, and from flathead mullet in Sardinia, where it is called Sardinian  but\u00e0riga.\nIts culinary properties may be compared to those of dry anchovies, although it is much more expensive. Often, it is served with olive oil or lemon juice as an appetizer accompanied by bread or crostini. It is also used in pasta dishes.\nBottarga is categorized as a traditional food product (prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale).\nBottarga is produced in Mauritania and Senegal.\nIn Turkey, bottarga is made from grey mullet roe. It is listed in the Ark of Taste. It is produced in Dalyan, on the southwestern coast of Turkey, from the mature fish migrating from Lake K\u00f6yce\u011fiz.\nBottarga in Spain is produced and consumed mainly in the country's southeastern region, in the Autonomous Community of Murcia and the province of Alicante. It is usually made from a variety of roes including, among others, grey mullet, tuna, bonito, or even black drum or common ling (the latter two somewhat cheaper and less valued). Much of its production is centered around the town of San Pedro del Pinatar, to the shores of the Mar Menor, where there are also salt ponds.\nThere are several producers in Florida. The Manatee county tourist bureau states that the process of making bottarga was depicted in Ancient Egyptian murals and that documentation from the 1500s exists that the Native Americans along the western coast of Florida were consuming dried mullet roe when encountered by European explorers.\nThere are various small producers elsewhere. For example, bottarga from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is produced in northern Norway, where it is air-dried.\n\"botargo\". Oxford English Dictionary (Online\u00a0ed.).

Garudiya or Garudhiya (\u078e\u07a6\u0783\u07aa\u078b\u07a8\u0794\u07a6) is a clear fish broth. It is one of the basic and traditional food items of Maldivian cuisine. The broth is based on tuna species found in the nation's ocean waters such as skipjack (kan\u1e0dumas or go\u1e0da), yellowfin tuna (kanneli), little tunny (la\u021b\u021bi), or frigate tuna) (raagon\u1e0di).\nDespite the introduction of new items in the Maldivian cuisine, garudiya is still a Maldivian favourite as it has been for generations.\nSometimes  Maldivians use chilies, curry leaves and onions to flavor the garudiya according to their taste, however, mostly this broth is cooked simply using fish, salt and water.\nKekki garudiya is a variant of garudiya with spices.\nGarudiya could be also obtained using other fishes like wahoo (kurumas), mahi-mahi (fiyala) or bluefin jack (handi), among others, but the favored fish for garudiya is tuna and related species.\nWhen the tuna-based garudiya is cooked until all the water evaporates, it forms a thick brown paste known as Rihaakuru that is highly valued in the Maldivian diet.\nMaldive fish\nList of tuna dishes\nXavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom, Barcelona 1999, ISBN\u00a084-7254-801-5\nEating on the Islands - As times have changed, so has the Maldives' unique cuisine and culture\nMIFCO; Rihaakuru Archived 2013-06-04 at the Wayback Machine",

Small pockets of air within the dough expand during baking and are contained by the elasticity of the starch paste.

It is a traditional Brazilian recipe, originating in the state of Minas Gerais.\nP\u00e3o de queijo originated from Portuguese colonists like many other Brazilian foods. Enslaved people would soak and peel the cassava root and make bread rolls from it. At this time, there was no cheese in the rolls. At the end of the 19th century, more ingredients became available to the colonial community such as milk and cheese. They added milk and cheese to the tapioca roll making what we now know as p\u00e3o de queijo. It is also widely eaten in northern Argentina and is inexpensive, often sold from streetside stands by vendors carrying a heat-preserving container. In Brazil, it is also very commonly found in groceries, supermarkets and bakeries, industrialized or freshly made.\nDespite being referred to as \"bread\", the cheese bread is basically a type of starch tart cookie or sweet plus eggs, salt, vegetable oil, and cheese, with soft and elastic consistency and with a few variations.\nWith the discovery of mines near Ouro Preto in around 1700, some 20% of the Brazilian population at that time, mainly slaves, occupied a vast territory in the southeast of the then-Portuguese colony. The mass forced colonisation shifted economic hub of the colony to the southeast.\nCreatively, Minas Gerais cooks replaced the non-existent wheat with starch derived from cassava tuber shown to them by tupiniquins indigenous groups. Added this was grated hard cheese similar to Parmesan.\nThere are several different recipes of Brazilian cheese bread where the ingredients and the type of cheese vary widely \u2013 as well as the final result. Some of them use sweet starch, other sour, or even both. But what gives it its main feature is that it is based on starch cassava and some kind of cheese.\nThe fat \u2013 lard, vegetable oil, butter or margarine \u2013 acts as a molecular lubricant,\n contributing to the elastic texture of the dough.\nThe egg gives colour and flavour to the recipe.\nThe type of cheese varies according to preference or availability. The most used are mozzarella, parmesan, and (more traditionally) Minas cheese (either in its \"ripened\" or \"standard\" version).  The cheese gives the typical flavor of the cheese bread, hence its name.\nThere is also the boiled cheese bread with a preparation technique that requires boiling water while preparing, sometimes mixed with vegetable oil in flour. The boiled cheese bread has the closest taste of natural, as in the boiling process the dough is pre-cooked.\nSome recipes use potato.\n\nIn Brazil, p\u00e3o de queijo is a popular breakfast dish and snack. It continues to be widely sold at snack bars and bakeries and it can also be bought frozen to bake at home. In Brazil, cheese puff mix packages are easily found in most supermarkets.\nGiven its growing popularity in the US, the frozen packages of pao de queijo can now be found in some American grocery stores such as Costco, County Market, HEB, Publix, World Market and Whole Foods.\nP\u00e3o de queijo arrived in Japan with the dekasegi. It is usually made with rice flour instead of the cassava (tapioca) starch.\nP\u00e3o de queijo is available in Australia in specialty international food stores and some major supermarkets, including Woolworths Supermarkets as of early 2021, where it is marketed as a \"naturally gluten-free\" snack.\nCheese bun (includes list of those popular in South America)\nGoug\u00e8re (from France)\nChipa (from Paraguay)\n\"chebe \u2013 History of P\u00e3o de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread)\". www.chebe.com.

                "description": "Fruit salad is a dish consisting of various kinds of fruit, sometimes served in a liquid, either their own juices or a syrup. In different forms, fruit salad can be served as an appetizer, a side salad, or a dessert. When served as an appetizer or dessert, a fruit salad is sometimes known as a fruit cocktail (often connoting a canned product), or fruit cup (when served in a small container). There are many types of fruit salad, ranging from the basic (no nuts, marshmallows, or dressing) to the moderately sweet (Waldorf salad) to the sweet (ambrosia salad). Another \"salad\" containing fruit is a jello salad, with its many variations. ...",

There are a number of home recipes for fruit salad that contain different kinds of fruit, or that use a different kind of sauce other than the fruit's own juice or syrup.  Common ingredients used in fruit salads include strawberries, pineapple, honeydew, watermelon, grapes, and kiwifruit. Various recipes may call for the addition of nuts, fruit juices, certain vegetables, yogurt, or other ingredients.\nOne variation is a Waldorf-style fruit salad, which uses a mayonnaise-based sauce. Other recipes use sour cream (such as in ambrosia), yogurt or even custard as the primary sauce ingredient. A variation on fruit salad uses whipped cream mixed in with many varieties of fruits (usually a mixture of berries), and also often includes miniature marshmallows. Rojak, a Malaysian fruit salad, uses a spicy sauce with peanuts and shrimp paste. In the Philippines, fruit salads are popular party and holiday fare, usually made with buko, or young coconut, and condensed milk in addition to other canned or fresh fruit.\nMexico has popular variation of the fruit salad called Bionico which consists of various fruits drenched in condensed milk and sour cream mix.\nThere is also an extended variety of fruit salads in Moroccan cuisine, often as part of a kemia, a selection of appetizers or small dishes analogous to Spanish tapas or eastern Mediterranean mezze.\nA fruit salad ice cream is also commonly manufactured, with small pieces of real fruit embedded, flavored either with juices from concentrate, fruit extracts, or artificial chemicals.\nFruit cocktail is often sold canned and is a staple of cafeterias, but can also be made fresh. The use of the word \"cocktail\" in the name does not mean that it contains alcohol, but refers to the secondary definition: \"an appetizer made by combining pieces of food, such as fruit or seafood\". \nIn the United States, the USDA stipulates that canned \"fruit cocktail\" must contain a certain percentage distribution of pears, grapes, cherries, peaches, and pineapples to be marketed as fruit cocktail. It must contain fruits in the following range of percentages:\n30% to 50% diced peaches, any yellow variety\n25% to 45% diced pears, any variety\n6% to 16% diced pineapple, any variety\n6% to 20% whole grapes, any seedless variety\n2% to 6% cherry halves, any light sweet or artificially colored red variety (like maraschino cherries)\nBoth William Vere Cruess of the University of California, Berkeley and Herbert Gray of the Barron-Gray Packing Company of San Jose, California have been credited with the invention of fruit cocktail. Barron\u2013Gray was the first company to sell fruit cocktail commercially, beginning in 1930, and California Packing Corporation began selling it under its Del Monte brand a few years later.\nCanned fruit cocktail and canned fruit salad are similar, but fruit salad contains larger fruit while fruit cocktail is diced.  Commercially, the fruit used was healthy but cosmetically damaged, such as a peach or pear that was bruised on one side.  The bruised parts would be cut away and discarded, and the rest would be diced into small pieces.\n\"Fruit Salad\" (also known as \"Fruit Salad Yummy Yummy\") is the name of a 1994 song by Australian children's band the Wiggles and on the television show Wonder Pets.\n\"Fruit-salad\" is also a slang term used for medals on a soldiers uniform, e.g. \"Look at the fruit-salad on that colonel.\" The term refers to the bright colors of a high percentage of the ribbons that usually go with medals.\n\"Fruit salad\" is an alternative name for the party game Fruit Basket Turnover.\nMacedonia (food), a variation made of small pieces of fruit or vegetable\nCompote, dessert of fruit in syrup\nGreen papaya salad, a savory salad made from unripe fruit\nCleric\u00f3 \u2013 a Latin American version of sangria, made from mixed fruit and wine\n\"Watermelon Salad: A Different kind of fruit salad\".

In 1899, Charlie Thompson, a Bassett's sales representative, supposedly tripped over and dropped a tray of samples he was showing a client in Leicester, mixing up the various sweets. After he scrambled to re-arrange them, the client was intrigued by the new creation.  Quickly the company began to mass-produce the allsorts and they became a successful product.\nBassett's have released two varieties of allsorts that do not feature any liquorice. Fruit Allsorts feature mixed-fruit flavoured sweets, while Dessert Allsorts have flavours such as apple tart and lemon cheesecake.  Both retain the shapes and textures of the original sweet. Red allsorts, with fruit-flavoured liquorice, were briefly released in the late 1990s, discontinued and later reintroduced to the UK with flavours including Blueberry Cube, Strawberry Check, and a red liquorice \"Betty Bassett\".\nThe original items mixed by Thompson were \"chips, rocks, buttons, nuggets, plugs and twists\". It is not clear which, if any, correspond to Bassets traditional allsorts, though certainly newer items have been introduced, such as the Bertie.\nThe Bassett's company mascot is Bertie Bassett, a figure made up of liquorice allsorts, which has become a part of British popular culture. The character's origins lie with advertising copywriter Frank Regan, who used the sweets and a number of pipe-cleaners to construct what was the original version of Bertie. One of the sweets in the modern day allsorts mix is a liquorice figure shaped like Bertie.\nThe Doctor Who television serial episode The Happiness Patrol featured a villain called the Kandy Man, who was made from liquorice allsorts and was thought by some to resemble Bertie Bassett. Although an internal investigation concluded that the programme had not infringed on Bassett's trademark, the BBC promised Bassett's that the Kandy Man would not appear again.\nIn the 2001 satirical comedy film Mike Bassett: England Manager, the figure of Bertie Bassett appears in a short scene on a newspaper with the headline \"Bassett's Allsorts\".\nAs a publicity stunt, Bassett's staged a mock wedding between actors dressed as Bertie and Betty Bassett, another character composed of confectionery, at its Sheffield factory, in February 2009.\nDolly Mixtures\nCadbury's, Our Brands: Bassett's\n\"Sweet new bride for Bertie at 80\".

Made of liquorice, sugar, coconut, aniseed jelly, fruit flavourings, and gelatine, they were first produced in Sheffield, England, by Geo. Bassett & Co Ltd. \nAllsorts are produced by many companies around the world, but are most popular in Europe, especially Britain and the Netherlands, where they are called Engelse drop, meaning English liquorice. They are also common in Scandinavia, where they are called Engelsk konfekt or Lakridskonfekt. South African confectionery giant Beacon produces substantial quantities of the product,  selling it locally and exporting it to Australia, Canada, and Portugal.",

In 1899, Charlie Thompson, a Bassett's sales representative, supposedly tripped over and dropped a tray of samples he was showing a client in Leicester, mixing up the various sweets. After he scrambled to re-arrange them, the client was intrigued by the new creation.  Quickly the company began to mass-produce the allsorts and they became a successful product.\nBassett's have released two varieties of allsorts that do not feature any liquorice. Fruit Allsorts feature mixed-fruit flavoured sweets, while Dessert Allsorts have flavours such as apple tart and lemon cheesecake.  Both retain the shapes and textures of the original sweet. Red allsorts, with fruit-flavoured liquorice, were briefly released in the late 1990s, discontinued and later reintroduced to the UK with flavours including Blueberry Cube, Strawberry Check, and a red liquorice \"Betty Bassett\".\nThe original items mixed by Thompson were \"chips, rocks, buttons, nuggets, plugs and twists\". It is not clear which, if any, correspond to Bassets traditional allsorts, though certainly newer items have been introduced, such as the Bertie.\nThe Bassett's company mascot is Bertie Bassett, a figure made up of liquorice allsorts, which has become a part of British popular culture. The character's origins lie with advertising copywriter Frank Regan, who used the sweets and a number of pipe-cleaners to construct what was the original version of Bertie. One of the sweets in the modern day allsorts mix is a liquorice figure shaped like Bertie.\nThe Doctor Who television serial episode The Happiness Patrol featured a villain called the Kandy Man, who was made from liquorice allsorts and was thought by some to resemble Bertie Bassett. Although an internal investigation concluded that the programme had not infringed on Bassett's trademark, the BBC promised Bassett's that the Kandy Man would not appear again.\nIn the 2001 satirical comedy film Mike Bassett: England Manager, the figure of Bertie Bassett appears in a short scene on a newspaper with the headline \"Bassett's Allsorts\".\nAs a publicity stunt, Bassett's staged a mock wedding between actors dressed as Bertie and Betty Bassett, another character composed of confectionery, at its Sheffield factory, in February 2009.\nDolly Mixtures\nCadbury's, Our Brands: Bassett's\n\"Sweet new bride for Bertie at 80\".

The dish is made of yellow egg noodles, which are also used in Hokkien mee, with a spicy slightly sweet curry-like gravy. The gravy is made from shrimp or tauchu broth, shallots, lemongrass, galangal, salam leaf (Indonesian bayleaf), kaffir lime leaf, gula jawa (Indonesian dark palm sugar), salt, water, and corn starch as thickening agent. The dish is garnished with a hard boiled egg,  dried shrimp, boiled potato, calamansi limes, spring onions, Chinese celery, green chillies, fried firm tofu (tau kwa), fried shallots and bean sprouts. Some eateries serve it with beef, though rarely found in hawker centres, or add dark soy sauce to the noodles when served. The dish also goes well with satay.\nIn the past, mi rebus was sold by mobile hawkers who carried two baskets over a pole. One basket contained a stove and a pot of boiling water, and the other the ingredients for the dish.\nIn certain areas, a similar variety of Mi Rebus is called Mie Jawa, Mee Jawa, Mi Jawa, Bakmi Jawa or Bakmi Godhog, although this is a popular misnomer, since Mie Jawa is slightly different from Mi Rebus. Despite sharing similar spices, Mie Jawa contains chicken instead of shrimp. A dish similar to Mi Rebus in Indonesia is called Mie Celor, and it is popular in Palembang.

B\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi originated from the B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Province of Vietnam's South Central Coast region. People in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh eat b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi for almost any meal during the day, instead of rice or noodle soups.\nMaking b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi is a multistep process. First, good rice is soaked in water overnight, then washed with water again three or four times until the water comes out clean. Then the rice is either ground with water into a mixture, or ground without water, but mixed into the water three or four times afterwards to leaven it without using any additional agent. The flour mixture is then either steamed and kneaded, or cooked in a pan, stirred continuously until it starts to coagulate, but no flour gets stuck on the stirring tool. This step is crucial in making b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi soft, light, and not sticky, but the strings of noodles will still have a firm texture. When the experienced b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi maker feels the dough is done, it is ready for pressing.\nSpecial copper or aluminium cylinders, with several small holes (the size of a needle eye), shape the cooked dough into noodle form. Pressing the dough requires great strength, as the dough is hard and the holes are small, so it is usually done with leverage. When one person presses the dough, another \"catches\" the noodles coming out on the other side, presses them together and cuts them off every 10\u00a0cm or so, creating a kind of mesh of noodle, which is then laid onto a flat surface, but not in layers. Finally, the sheets are steamed one last time for about five minutes.\nLike b\u00fan (rice vermicelli) dishes, b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi is served cold. Traditionally b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh is rolled into bundles and always served with chopped garlic chives. The garlic chives are quickly stir-fried with oil, its aroma and taste go well with b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi, which makes the dish enjoyable by itself and without any other kinds of herbs.\nIn central Vietnam, such as Hu\u1ebf, b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi is eaten with dried prawns and n\u01b0\u1edbc ch\u1ea5m. In southern Vietnam, b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi is eaten with a variety of meats, especially roast pork or duck. There are also b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi ch\u1ea3 gi\u00f2, b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi with shrimp paste on sugar cane stick, and b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi with grilled pork, chicken, or beef. At the G\u00f2 Du\u1ed1i market in Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c commune, S\u00f4ng C\u1ea7u district, Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean Province, one also finds b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi l\u00f2ng heo G\u00f2 Du\u1ed1i, which is b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi with boiled pig offal.\nSince making b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi is a skilful process, the dish is highly regarded, and is served at ceremonial parties, such as wedding and ancestor memorial days.\nCovering b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi tightly reduces surface drying, which can make it sour, so market sellers put fresh b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi in bamboo baskets with banana leaves, and usually leave it open to the air. For convenience or sanitary reasons, there are dried, packaged b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi, similar to dried, packaged rice vermicelli, for people who want to cook it themselves instead of buying fresh b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi from the markets.\nVietnamese noodles\n\"B\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi \u0111\u1ea5t v\u00f5\". 2 September 2009.\nhttp://phuyennet.vn/khcndp/index.php?menu=detail&mid=54&nid=365 Trang Th\u00f4ng tin KHCN Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean\nvietbao.vn. \"V\u1ec1 B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh \u0103n b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi\". vietbao.vn.",

The name tibok-tibok literally means \"[like a] heartbeat\". This is due to the method of determining if the dish is cooked. Once it has reduced to a firm consistency, the bubbles barely break the surface, making it look like it is pulsating.\nTibok-tibok is prepared similarly to maja blanca. Carabao milk is traditionally mixed with a small amount of galapong, ground glutinous rice that has been soaked overnight. It is flavored with a small amount of white sugar and dayap (key lime) zest. It is simmered at low heat while stirring continuously until the mixture thickens. It is immediately poured into a flat pan lined with greased banana leaves and allowed to cool. It can also be poured into molds as desired. It is usually served as square or diamond-shaped slices. It is topped with latik (coconut curds). It is stored in airtight containers to prevent it from drying out.\nCarabao milk can be substituted with whole fat cow's milk in areas where it is not available. Less traditional preparations might also substitute rice flour or cornstarch for galapong, or exclude it altogether.\nKesong puti\nEspasol\nLeche flan\nSapin-sapin\n\"Authentic Tibok Tibok (Carabao's Milk Pudding)\".

Ashure or Noah's pudding is a dessert porridge that is made of a mixture consisting of grains, fruits, dried fruits and nuts. \nIn the Balkans and Turkey Sufi Muslims make the dish during the month of Muharram in which the Day of Ashure takes place. Traditionally, ashure is made in large quantities to commemorate the ark's landing and is distributed to friends, relatives, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, and others, without regard to the recipient's religion or belief system as an offering of peace and love. Ashure was traditionally made and eaten during the colder months of the year due to its heavy and calorie rich nature, but now it is enjoyed year-round. Armenians make it as a Christmas pudding and for New Year's celebrations, where it is a centerpiece.\nIn anecdotal history, it is claimed that when Noah's Ark came to rest on Mount Ararat, Noah's family celebrated with a special dish. Since their supplies were nearly exhausted, what was left (primarily grains, dried fruits and the like) was cooked together to form a pudding, what is now called ashure. \nTurkish families make ashure pudding to commemorate this event. Among Turkish and Bosnian Sufis (especially Bektashi), the ashure pudding is prepared with special prayers for health, healing, safety, success and spiritual nourishment. Ashure is distributed to the poor, as well as to neighbors, friends and relatives.\nEvliya \u00c7elebi says in his travelbook Seyahatname that \"Ashure is a porridge (a\u015f) that should be cooked at the tenth of Muharram.\"\nIn Armenia, ashure may be garnished with pomegranate seeds and flavored with rose water, and the pudding is shared with neighbors during the Christmas season. The festive pudding is the centerpiece of the New Year's table, which is often decorated with dried fruits, nuts and pomegranates.\nThe word Ashure comes from the Arabic word Ashura Arabic: \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0621\u200e \u02bb\u0100sh\u016br\u0101\u2019\u00a0, meaning 'tenth'. In Turkish tradition, this dish is made mostly on 10th of Muharram or after 10th of Muharram in Islamic Lunar Calendar. The association with Muharram is not only significant in Islamic beliefs, but also pre-Islamic beliefs, with some Semitic stories also referencing this month.\nAlso in Turkish, Ash(A\u015f) represents mixed porridge. It is derived from Persian word \"Ashur\" meaning mixing.\nAshoriya, grains and cereals are eaten in remembrance for the drowned people of Noah's flood in Mandaeism\nFieldhouse, P. (2017).

A club sandwich, also called a clubhouse sandwich, is a sandwich of bread (traditionally toasted), sliced cooked poultry, ham or fried bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise. \nIt is often cut into quarters or halves and held together by cocktail sticks. Modern versions frequently have two layers which are separated by an additional slice of bread.\nThe club sandwich may have originated at the Union Club of New York City. The earliest known reference to the sandwich, an article that appeared in The Evening World on November 18, 1889, is also an early recipe: \"Have you tried a Union Club sandwich yet? Two toasted pieces of Graham bread, with a layer of turkey or chicken and ham between them, served warm.\"  Several other early references also credit the chef of the Union Club with creating the sandwich.\nAnother theory is that the club sandwich was invented at the Saratoga Club in Saratoga Springs, New York, after Richard Canfield bought it and made it into the Canfield Casino in 1894. \nOther sources find the origin of the club sandwich to be up for debate.\nThe sandwich appeared on U.S. restaurant menus as early as 1899. The earliest reference to the sandwich in published fiction is from Conversations of a Chorus Girl, a 1903 book by Ray Cardell. Historically, club sandwiches featured slices of chicken, but with time, turkey has become increasingly common. An 1897 recipe has three layers, with the chicken and ham separated not by a slice of bread, but by a lettuce leaf.\nDagwood sandwich\nList of sandwiches\nBreene, Sophia (March 19, 2013). \"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the Club Sandwich\".

Trail mix or scroggin is a type of snack mix, typically a combination of granola, dried fruit, nuts, and sometimes candy, developed as a food to be taken along on hikes. Trail mix is considered an ideal snack food for hikes, because it is lightweight, easy to store, and nutritious, providing a quick energy boost from the carbohydrates in the dried fruit or granola, and sustained energy from fats in nuts.\nThe combination of nuts, raisins and chocolate as a trail snack dates at least to the 1910s, when outdoorsman Horace Kephart recommended it in his popular camping guide.\nIn New Zealand, trail mix is known as \"scroggin\" or \"schmogle\". In Australia, the term \"scroggin\" is used exclusively, although in more recent years, \"trail mix\" has been imported into the jargon from the USA. Some claim that the name stands for sultanas, carob, raisins, orange peel, grains, glucose, and nuts or alternatively sultanas, chocolate, raisins and other goody-goodies including nuts; but this may be a backronym.\nThe American word gorp, a term for trail mix often used by hikers in North America, is typically said to be an acronym for \"good ol' raisins and peanuts\", although the mix may contain M&M's and other nuts. The Oxford English Dictionary cites a 1913 reference to the verb gorp, meaning \"to eat greedily\", so the \"good ol' raisins and peanuts\" explanation may be folk etymology.\nIn Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and several other European countries, trail mix is called \"student fodder\", \"student oats\", or \"student mix\" in the local languages and usually does not include chocolate. In Iran mixed nuts is called \"ajil\", eaten at festivals like Yald\u0101 Night or just a social \"mehmooni\".\nSnack mix\nSnacking\nKephart, Horace (1916).

The production of coconut candy starts with the grating of fresh coconut flesh. The grated flesh is then pressed to extract coconut milk and coconut cream. The next step is the addition of malt syrup and sugar to this mixture of coconut milk and cream. The ratio of the various ingredients is a closely guarded secret of individual coconut candy manufacturers. The mixing process is often entrusted only to family members of the factory owner. Slight variations in the ingredient ratios can lead to very different texture and taste in the final product.\nThe mixture is then heated to a very high temperature in large woks over fires generated by the burning of coconut shells. While being heated, the mixture is stirred continuously to ensure even heat distribution. Traditionally, this stirring process was done manually with large wooden paddles. In larger modern manufacturing facilities, these paddles have been replaced by electric motors. The mixture eventually caramelises to a thicker texture. Recognising when the mixture has been cooked to the right level is more of an art than an exact science. While it is still hot and soft, the thickened mixture is then stringed out into moulds and allowed to cool. The final step sees the candy strings cut into rectangular lozenges, then wrapped and packaged.\nTraditionally, coconut candy is wrapped in two layers of wrappings. The inner layer is edible rice paper, and the outer layer is paper soaked in vegetable oil. These measures were necessary to stop the candy from sticking to the paper wrapping. Larger manufacturers now use heat-sealed foil paper, which does not stick to the candy.\nBen Tre currently has over one hundred coconut candy manufacturers, making up thirty percent of local enterprises. However, the market is dominated by a handful of well-known brands, with most manufacturers producing candy under licence for these brands. Coconut candy is sold throughout Vietnam. It is also exported to other Asian countries, Australia, Europe and North America.\n",

Ciabatta is somewhat elongated, broad, and flat, and is baked in many variations, although unique for its alveolar holes. Ciabatta is made with a strong flour and uses a much wetter dough than traditional French bread.

Ciabatta bread was first produced in 1982, by Arnaldo Cavallari, who called the bread ciabatta polesana after Polesine, the area he lived in. The recipe was subsequently licensed by Cavallari's company, Molini Adriesi, to bakers in 11 countries by 1999. Cavallari and other bakers in Italy were concerned by the popularity of sandwiches made from baguettes imported from France, which were endangering their businesses, and so set about trying to create an Italian alternative with which to make sandwiches. The recipe for ciabatta came about after several weeks of trying variations of traditional bread recipes and consists of a soft, wet dough made with high gluten flour.\nMany regions have their own variations on the original recipe or a bread that closely resembles ciabatta and has become accepted as a variety of ciabatta; the ciabatta from the area encompassing Lake Como has a crisp crust, a somewhat soft, porous texture, and is light to the touch.  The ciabatta found in Tuscany, Umbria, and Marche varies from bread that has a firm crust and dense crumb to bread that has a crisper crust and more open texture, and in Rome, it is often seasoned with marjoram.\nNew variations of the recipe continue to be developed. Wholemeal ciabatta is known as ciabatta integrale, and when milk is added to the dough, it becomes ciabatta al latte.\nCiabatta bread was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1985 by Marks & Spencer, then to the United States in 1987 by Orlando Bakery, a Cleveland firm.  Three bakers from Italy went to Orlando Bakery to develop the product for mass production. They successfully introduced a fresh bread, and later a frozen version. It was quickly copied throughout the US. The more open-crumbed form, which is usual in the United States, is made from a very wet dough, often requiring machine-kneading, and a biga or sourdough starter.\nRiley, Gillian (2007).

Wuzetka ( voo-zetka [vuz\u025btka]) is a chocolate sponge and cream pie which originated in Warsaw, Poland. Its name is probably derived from the Warsaw W-Z Route, on which the confectionery that first began to sell the dessert in late 1940s was located. Traditional to Varsovian cuisine, the dessert was exclusively served by caf\u00e9s and restaurants in Warsaw, but soon became a beloved home-made food in Poland.\nThe dessert most likely originated at the turn of the 1940s and 1950s in one of Warsaw's newly-founded sweet shops. However, the precise origin of the name is debatable; historians and certain sources agree that the cake was probably named after the Warsaw W-Z Route (East-West Route), which ran next to the shop. Other sources state that the name comes from the acronym \"WZC\", which either stood for the Warsaw Confectionery Plants (Warszawskie Zak\u0142ady Cukiernicze) or for the Polish term \"pastry with chocolate\" (wypiek z czekolad\u0105). The abbreviation \"WZK\" for \"pastry with cream\" (wypiek z kremem) is also a possibility.\nThe confectionery store was most likely situated somewhere near or in the \"Kino Muran\u00f3w\" cinema building on 5 Andersa Street, in the Muran\u00f3w district of Warsaw.\nList of Polish desserts\nNapoleonka\nKarpatka\n\"Wyborcza.pl\". warszawa.wyborcza.pl.\n\"Niezwyk\u0142e \"wuzetki\" to jeden z symboli Warszawy, lubicie?

Seolgitteok---also called muritteok (\ubb34\ub9ac\ub5a1)---is regarded as the most basic form of sirutteok and is made only with rice. \"Kyeotteok\" consists of multiple layers of azuki bean or other bean powder and a rice-glutinous rice mixture.\nBaekseolgi (\ubc31\uc124\uae30) - a variety of siru tteok.

Pecel ([p\u0259t\u0361\u0283\u0259l]), (Javanese:\ua9a5\ua9bc\ua995\ua9bc\ua9ad\ua9c0) is a traditional Javanese salad with peanut sauce, usually eaten with carbs (steamed rice, lontong or ketupat).\nThe simplicity of pecel preparation and its cheap price have contributed to its popularity throughout Java. It has become a food that represents practicality, simplicity, and travel, since the dish is often found along the train journey across Java.\nPecel was introduced to Malaysia, where it is known as pecal, by Javanese immigrants. Pecel is also very popular in Suriname, where it was introduced by the Javanese Surinamese.\nIn Babad Tanah Jawi (circa 17th century), Ki Gede Pemanahan referred to the dish he presented to his guest, Sunan Kalijaga as \"pecel-ized boiled vegetables\". In Javanese language, \"pecel\" used to refer to the act of squeezing the water out of something. \nSunan Kalijaga was not familiar with the dish as he came from northeastern part of Central Java, while the dish was native to Yogyakarta. This dish became one of the most popular Javanese dishes soon after it was introduced to other regions of Java, and the word pecel took its current meaning, \"a side dish that is made of vegetables and sauce\".\nPecel is only one of many Javanese vegetable-based salads. It is similar to lothek, except that lothek is usually served with fried batter or tofu and uses both raw and cooked vegetables.\nThe difference usually lies on the thickness level of the sauce, the taste profiles (spicy, sweet, or savory). In Central Java, pecel sauce is sweet-savory with medium thickness, except in northern coast and north-eastern regions where the sauce tends to be more spicy and the sauce is usually a bit thinner than usual. In East Java, especially Madiun, the peanut sauce is very thin and spicy. Lamtoro seeds are often added as a topping. \nIn Tegal, Central Java, pecel sauce is made of peanut and casava root. In Surakarta's pecel ndeso, black sesame sauce is used on top of peanut sauce.\nIn Yogyakarta, pecel is served with bacem (sweet-simmered) tempeh or tofu. In Surakarta, a pecel variant called lothek (alt. spelling: lotek) includes the use of some raw vegetables, lontong, and gorengan. The name \"lothek\" is derived from \"luthik\", a wooden spatula used to scoop the peanut sauce from a cowek (grinding bowl).\nKaredok\nTipat cantok\nKetoprak\nLawar\nList of salads\nPecel lele\nUrap\nPutra AW, Nedi (24 October 2019). \"Digging into the history of 'pecel'\".

Chikki is a traditional Indian sweet (brittle) generally made from nuts and jaggery/sugar. There are several different varieties of chikki in addition to the most common groundnut (peanut) chikki. Each variety of chikki is named after the ingredients used, which include puffed or roasted Bengal gram, sesame, puffed rice, beaten rice, or khobra (desiccated coconut), and other nuts such as almonds, cashews and pistachios. \nIn regions of North India, especially Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, this sweet is called layiya patti. In Sindh and Sindhi regions of India, it is called layee or lai and in other north Indian states, it is also known as gajak or maroonda. In Bangladesh, West Bengal and other Bengali-speaking regions, it is known as gur badam. In the South Indian states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, it is called palli patti. In Kerala it is called Kappalandi muthai. In Tamil Nadu it is called kadalai mittai. Similar dishes are also very popular in Brazil, where it is known as p\u00e9-de-moleque, and in Paraguay, where it is called ka'i ladrillo.\nThe preparation of chikkis consists of first preparing the hot jaggery syrup with a minimum of water, adding nuts to the syrup to coat them (with the syrup) and then transferring the nuts to a wooden mould, then rolling them to a thickness of about 6\u20138\u00a0mm using a wooden roller, then placing into a steel plate for cooling, cutting into slabs, and packing. In homes, smaller quantities are hand rolled with wooden rollers.\nMost popular chikkis are sourced from the Indian towns of Bhuj in Gujarat;  Kovilpatti in Tamil Nadu; Standard Cold Pressed Oil Madurai, Palakkad , Central Travancore, Kannur, Cherthala in Kerala, Lonavala, Matheran, Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani, and Karjat in Maharashtra.\nGajak, a similar candy with sesame seeds\nKovilpatti\nLonavala chikki\nPeanut brittle, a similar candy with a lower proportion of nuts\nGozinaki\nList of peanut dishes\nTameletjie\nAlegr\u00eda (Mexican candy)\nP\u00e9-de-moleque\nChitrodia, Rucha Biju. \"A low-cal twist to sweet sensations\".

Jollof (/d\u0292\u0259\u02c8l\u0252f/), or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions.\nThe origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. The dish has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables. \nFood and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in \"linguistic, historical or political patterns\". \nInstead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of \"blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy\" as well as the religion of Islam. \nMarc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia. \nIt may then have spread throughout the region through the historical commercial, cultural and religious channels linking Senegal with Ghana, Nigeria and beyond, many of which continue to thrive today, such as the Tij\u0101niyyah Sufi brotherhood bringing thousands of West African pilgrims to Senegal annually.\nJollof rice is one of the most common dishes in West Africa. There are several regional variations in name and ingredients, for example, in Mali it is called zaam\u00e8 in Bamanankan. The dish's most common name of Jollof derives from the name of the Wolof people, though in Senegal and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as ceebu j\u00ebn or benachin. In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras. Despite the variations, the dish is \"mutually intelligible\" across the regions and has become the best known African dish outside the continent.\nEach West African country has at least one variant form of the dish, with Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cameroon particularly competitive as to which country makes the best jollof. This is especially prominent between Nigeria and Ghana, in a rivalry dubbed the \"Jollof Wars\".\nAlthough considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian jollof rice includes long grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, pepper, vegetable oil, onions, and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are cooked in one pot, of which a rich meat stock and a fried tomato and pepper puree characteristically forms the base. Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid. The dish is then served with the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi moi, steamed vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc. In the riverine areas of Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein, seafood often takes the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice.\nGhanaian jollof rice is made of vegetable oil, onion, bell pepper, cloves of pressed garlic, chillies, tomato paste, beef or goat meat or chicken (some times alternated with mixed vegetables), local or refined rice and black pepper. The method of cooking jollof begins with first preparing the beef or chicken by seasoning and frying it until it is well-cooked. The rest of the ingredients are then fried all together, starting from onions, pepper, tomato paste, tomatoes and spices in that order. After all the ingredients have been fried, rice is then added and cooked until the meal is prepared. Ghanaian jollof is typically served with side dishes of beef, chicken, well-seasoned fried fish, or mixed vegetables.\nJollof in Ghana is also served alongside shito, a popular type of pepper which originates from Ghana, and salad during parties and other ceremonies.\nSince the 2010s there has been increasing interest in West African foods in the western world. Jollof food festivals have been held in Washington, DC, in the US, and Toronto, Canada. \"World Jollof Day\" has been celebrated since 2015 on 22 August, gaining traction on social media.\nCharleston red rice\nJambalaya\nList of African dishes\nThieboudienne\nAyto, John (2012). \"Jollof rice\".

In this state, sugars are unstable. In ring form, sugars are stable and therefore exist in this form in most foods, including lollipops. Sugar is a very versatile ingredient and is used in a wide variety of food products. Sugar interacts differently depending on the presence of other ingredients and on various treatments. ...",

A lollipop is a type of sugar candy usually consisting of hard candy mounted on a stick and intended for sucking or licking. Different informal terms are used in different places, including lolly, sucker, sticky-pop, etc. Lollipops are available in many flavors and shapes.\nLollipops are available in a number of colors and flavors, particularly fruit flavors. With numerous companies producing lollipops, the candy now comes in dozens of flavors and many different shapes. Lollipops can range from very small candies bought in bulk and given away as a courtesy at banks, barbershops, and other locations, to very large treats made from candy canes twisted into a spiral shape.\nMost lollipops are eaten at room temperature, but \"ice lollipops\", \"ice lollies\", or \"popsicles\" are frozen water-based lollipops. Similar confections on a stick made of ice cream, often with a flavored coating, are usually not called by this name.\nSome lollipops contain fillings, such as bubble gum or soft candy. Some novelty lollipops have more unusual items, such as mealworm larvae, embedded in the candy.\nOther novelty lollipops have non-edible centers, such as a flashing light embedded within the candy; there is also a trend, principally in North America, of lollipops with sticks attached to a motorized device that makes the candy spin around in one's mouth.\nIn the Nordic countries, Germany, and the Netherlands, some lollipops are flavored with salmiak.\nLollipops can be used to carry medicines.\nSome lollipops have been marketed for use as diet aids, although their effectiveness is untested, and anecdotal cases of weight loss may be due to the power of suggestion. Flavored lollipops containing medicine are intended to give children medicine without fuss.\nActiq is a powerful analgesic lollipop whose active ingredient is fentanyl. Often, patients utilizing large amounts of opioid pain medication take Actiq lozenges on a handle in order to control breakthrough cancer pain.\nThe idea of an edible candy on a stick is very simple, and it is probable that the lollipop has been invented and reinvented numerous times. The first confectioneries that closely resemble what we call lollipops date to the Middle Ages, when the nobility would often eat boiled sugar with the aid of sticks or handles.\nThe invention of the modern lollipop is still something of a mystery but a number of American companies in the early 20th century have laid claim to it. According to the book Food for Thought: Extraordinary Little Chronicles of the World, they were invented by George Smith of New Haven, Connecticut, who started making large hard candies mounted on sticks in 1908. He named them after a racehorse of the time, Lolly Pop - and trademarked the lollipop name in 1931.\nThe term 'lollipop' was recorded by English lexicographer Francis Grose in 1796. The term may have derived from the term \"lolly\" (tongue) and \"pop\" (slap). The first references to the lollipop in its modern context date to the 1920s. Alternatively, it may be a word of Romany origin being related to the Roma tradition of selling candy apples on a stick. Red apple in the Romany language is loli phaba.\nWhile the main functional ingredients of a lollipop are quite simple, the process of making such confections can be complex. The formation and physical state of the glassy amorphous structure used in the creation of the lollipop is an involved chemical process. The first step in making lollipops after mixing the main ingredients is the heating process. During heating, the molecules increase in their translational mobility and therefore begin to resemble liquids. Although many hard candies are heated to about 310\u02daF, the temperature that the solution is heated to is dependent on the specific volume and contents of the mixture. After heating is complete, the solution can then be cooled. The final cooled solution is a supersaturated due to the moisture content dropping below 2%. Supersaturated or supercooled liquids are also formed  due to inhibitors preventing crystallization. They are unstable because crystallization is a favored reaction in this case. During the cooling process, the most important physicochemical characteristic of lollipops, the glass transition process, occurs.\nGlass transition is the solid-liquid transformation of amorphous material. It is a reversible change of the solid and liquid states of supercooled liquids. Glass transition occurs approximately 100\u02daC-150\u02daC below the equilibrium melting temperature of a pure substance. This dynamic transition is not a change of state, but a change of phase. It can be looked at in terms of a change in the molecular motion of the liquid, not a change in the molecular order itself. This",

B\u00fan ch\u1ea3 (Vietnamese:\u00a0[\u0253\u01d4n ca\u1dc9\u02d0]) is a Vietnamese dish of grilled pork and noodle, which is thought to have originated from Hanoi, Vietnam. B\u00fan ch\u1ea3 is served with grilled fatty pork (ch\u1ea3) over a plate of white rice noodle (b\u00fan) and herbs with a side dish of dipping sauce. The dish was described in 1959 by Vietnamese food writer Vu Bang (1913\u20131984), who described Hanoi as a town \"transfixed by b\u00fan ch\u1ea3.\" Hanoi's first b\u00fan ch\u1ea3 restaurant was on Gia Ng\u01b0, Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District, in Hanoi's Old Quarter.\nB\u00fan ch\u1ea3 originated and remains very popular in Hanoi. Outside Hanoi, across all regions of Vietnam, a similar dish of rice vermicelli and grilled meat called b\u00fan th\u1ecbt n\u01b0\u1edbng is alternately served.\nB\u00fan Ch\u1ea3 H\u01b0\u01a1ng Li\u00ean restaurant in Hanoi became famous after United States President Barack Obama dropped in for B\u00fan ch\u1ea3 with Chef Anthony Bourdain while he was on his trip to Vietnam in May 2016.\nB\u00fan ch\u1ea3 is usually eaten at noon. This is a very unique feature of Hanoi's culinary culture. However, nowadays, there are also some restaurants selling b\u00fan ch\u1ea3 for all day.\nB\u00fan th\u1ecbt n\u01b0\u1edbng\nDaniel Hoyer (194), Culinary Vietnam, Gibbs Smith, p.\u00a0102, ISBN\u00a0978-1-4236-0320-7, retrieved 21 January 2011\nThanh Nien A b\u00fan ch\u1ea3 that could wake the dead \u2013 Resurrecting a dead writer\u2019s dream meal in Ho Chi Minh City 2 March 2012\nAnn Lee The Little Saigon Cookbook \"B\u00fan ch\u1ea3\"\nAndrea Nguyen Into the Vietnamese Kitchen \"B\u00fan ch\u1ea3\"\nB\u1eefa t\u1ed1i b\u1ea5t ng\u1edd c\u1ee7a T\u1ed5ng th\u1ed1ng Obama trong qu\u00e1n b\u00fan ch\u1ea3 (Obama's surprise visit to the bun cha restaurant) VnExpress, May 10, 2021.\n\"How to make Hanoi bun cha\" (in Vietnamese).

Buddha's delight, often transliterated as Lu\u00f3h\u00e0n zh\u0101i, lo han jai, or lo hon jai, is a vegetarian dish well known in Chinese and Buddhist cuisine. It is sometimes also called Lu\u00f3h\u00e0n c\u00e0i (simplified Chinese: \u7f57\u6c49\u83dc; traditional Chinese: \u7f85\u6f22\u83dc).\nThe dish is traditionally enjoyed by Buddhist monks who are vegetarians, but it has also grown in popularity throughout the world as a common dish available as a vegetarian option in Chinese restaurants.  The dish consists of various vegetables and other vegetarian ingredients (sometimes with the addition of seafood or eggs), which are cooked in soy sauce-based liquid with other seasonings until tender. The specific ingredients used vary greatly both inside and outside Asia.\nIn the name lu\u00f3h\u00e0n zh\u0101i, lu\u00f3h\u00e0n \u2013 short for \u0100 lu\u00f3h\u00e0n (simplified Chinese: \u963f\u7f57\u6c49; traditional Chinese: \u963f\u7f85\u6f22; pinyin: \u0100 Lu\u00f3H\u00e0n) \u2013 is the Chinese transliteration  of the Sanskrit arhat, meaning an enlightened, ascetic individual or the Buddha himself.  Zh\u0101i (simplified Chinese: \u658b; traditional Chinese: \u9f4b; pinyin: zh\u0101i) means \"vegetarian food\" or \"vegetarian diet.\"\nThe dish is usually made with at least 10 ingredients, although more elaborate versions may comprise 18 or even 35 ingredients. If 18 ingredients are used, the dish is called Lu\u00f3h\u00e0n qu\u00e1nzh\u0101i (simplified: \u7f57\u6c49\u5168\u658b; traditional: \u7f85\u6f22\u5168\u9f4b).\nIn China and Hong Kong, when served exclusively using only the most flavor-packed vegetarian ingredients, such as pickled tofu or sweet bean curds, it is known as ti\u00e1n su\u0101n zh\u0101i (simplified Chinese: \u751c\u9178\u658b; traditional Chinese: \u751c\u9178\u9f4b; literally \"sweet and sour vegetarian dish\").\nAs suggested by its name, it is a dish traditionally enjoyed by Buddhists, but it has also grown in popularity throughout the world as a common dish available in Chinese restaurants (though often not including all of the ingredients) as a vegetarian option. It is traditionally served in Chinese households on the first day of the Chinese New Year, stemming from the old Buddhist practice that one should maintain a vegetarian diet in the first five days of the new year, as a form of self-purification. Some of the rarer ingredients, such as fat choy and arrowhead, are generally only eaten at this time of year.\nTraditionally eggs and dairy are not permitted. \nAlliums and some other vegetables (w\u01d4 h\u016bn) are not used in Buddha's delight, as they are frowned upon in Buddhist cuisine.\n\nArrowhead (\u6148\u83c7 or \u8328\u83f0; pinyin: c\u00edg\u016b)\nBamboo fungus (\u7af9\u7b19, pinyin: zh\u00fash\u0113ng or \u7af9\u836a; pinyin: zh\u00fas\u016bn)\nBamboo shoots (simplified: \u7b0b; traditional; \u7b4d; pinyin: s\u01d4n)\nBean curd sticks (\u8150\u7af9; pinyin: f\u01d4zh\u00fa; also called \"tofu bamboo\")\nBlack mushrooms (\u51ac\u83c7; pinyin: d\u014dngg\u016b)\nCarrot (traditional: \u80e1\u863f\u8514; simplified: \u80e1\u841d\u535c, pinyin: h\u00fa lu\u00f3bo; or traditional: \u7d05\u863f\u8514; simplified: \u7ea2\u841d\u535c, pinyin: h\u00f3ng lu\u00f3bo)\nCellophane noodles (\u7c89\u7d72; pinyin: f\u011bns\u012b; also called \"bean threads\")\nDaylily buds (\u91d1\u9488; pinyin: j\u012bnzh\u0113n; also called \"golden needles\")\nFat choy (traditional: \u9aee\u83dc; simplified: \u53d1\u83dc; pinyin: f\u00e0c\u00e0i; a black hair-like cyanobacteria)\nGinkgo nuts (traditional: \u9280\u674f; simplified: \u94f6\u674f, pinyin: y\u00ednx\u00ecng;  or \u767d\u679c, pinyin: b\u00e1igu\u01d2)\nLotus seeds (\u84ee\u5b50; pinyin: li\u00e1nz\u01d0)\nNapa cabbage (\u5927\u767d\u83dc; pinyin: d\u00e0 b\u00e1ic\u00e0i)\nPeanuts (\u82b1\u751f; pinyin: hu\u0101sh\u0113ng)\nSnow peas (traditional: \u8377\u862d\u8c46; simplified: \u8377\u5170\u8c46; pinyin: h\u00e9l\u00e1n-d\u00f2u)\nFried tofu (\u70b8\u8c46\u8150; pinyin: zh\u00e1 d\u00f2uf\u01d4)\nWater chestnuts (traditional: \u8378\u85ba; simplified: \u8378\u8360; pinyin: b\u00edq\u00ed)\nFried or braised wheat gluten (traditional: \u9eb5\u7b4b, simplified: \u9762\u7b4b; pinyin: mi\u00e0nj\u012bn)\nWood ear (\u6728\u8033; pinyin: m\u00f9 \u011br; also called black fungus)\nBean sprouts (\u8c46\u82bd, pinyin: d\u00f2uy\u00e1; \u82bd\u83dc, pinyin: y\u00e1c\u00e0i; or \u94f6\u82bd, pinyin: y\u00edny\u00e1)\nBracken fern tips (\u8568\u83dc; pinyin: ju\u00e9c\u00e0i)\nBok choy (\u767d\u83dc; pinyin: b\u00e1ic\u00e0i)\nCauliflower (\u83dc\u82b1; pinyin: c\u00e0i hu\u0101)\nChinese celery (\u82b9\u83dc; pinyin: q\u00edn c\u00e0i)\nOther types of fungus, including cloud ear fungus (traditional: \u96f2\u8033; simplified: \u4e91\u8033; pinyin: y\u00fan \u011br), elm ear fungus (\u6986\u8033; pinyin: y\u00fa \u011br), osmanthus ear fungus (\u6842\u82b1\u8033; pinyin: gu\u00edhu\u0101 \u011br), snow fungus (\u94f6\u8033; pinyin: y\u00edn \u011br), and yellow fungus (\u9ec3\u8033; pinyin: hu\u00e1ng \u011br; literally \"yellow ear\") See also: List of Chinese mushrooms and fungi.\nRed jujubes (traditional: \u7d05\u68d7; simplified: \u7ea2\u67a3; pinyin: h\u00f3ng z\u01ceo)\nLotus root (\u85d5; pinyin: \u01d2u)\nOther types of mushrooms, including straw mushrooms (\u8349\u83c7, pinyin: c\u01ceog\u016b), oyster mushrooms (\u5e73\u83c7, pinyin: p\u00edngg\u016b), and Tricholoma mushrooms (\u53e3\u8611, pinyin: k\u01d2um\u00f3)\nPotato (\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af; pinyin: m\u0103l\u00edngsh\u01d4)\nLaminaria\nCornflower buds\nBaby corn\nGinger (simplified: \u59dc; traditional: \u8591; pinyin: ji\u0101ng)\nMonosodium glutamate (\u5473\u7cbe; pinyin: w\u00e8ij\u012bng)\nVegetable oil (usually peanut, \u82b1\u751f\u6cb9; and/or sesame, \u829d\u9ebb\u6cb9)\nVegetarian Oyster sauce (simplified: \u658b\u869d\u6cb9; traditional: \u9f4b\u8814\u6cb9; pinyin: zh\u0101i h\u00e1oy\u00f3u)\nPickled tofu (\u8c46\u8150\u4e73; pinyin: d\u00f2ufu r\u01d4; both red and white)\nSalt (traditional: \u9e7d; simplified: \u76d0; pinyin: y\u00e1n)\nDark soy sauce (\u8001\u62bd; pinyin: l\u01ceoch\u014du)\nStarch (\u6dc0\u7c89; pinyin: di\u00e0nf\u011bn)\nSugar (\u7cd6;",

Allied Bakeries Ireland (ABI) is the market leader with over 81 per cent value share of the Veda market within Northern Ireland, which it sells as \"Sunblest Veda\". In Northern England, veda bread is something quite different: a sweet, sticky loaf made with black treacle. It is eaten sliced, dry, or with butter or margarine. The molasses in the treacle help to preserve the mixture, and veda bread connoisseurs will leave a freshly baked loaf for several weeks in a closed cake tin to allow the flavours to mature before they eat it.",

It is still impossible to find a recipe for a Veda loaf, over a hundred years after it was invented. However, devotees have had good results by following the instructions for a malted fruit loaf but without the fruit or alcohol.\nAlthough a sweet bread, Veda is often eaten toasted with butter and cheese, although many prefer to add jam or marmalade. It is usually eaten as a snack.\nVeda Bakeries hold all the original recipes for Veda bread. Veda Bakeries is a company registered by law. The company is based East Lothian, and is owned by Jim Kerr of Forthestuary Cereals.\nThe formula for Veda was allegedly stumbled upon by luck when a Dundee farmer's house-keeper accidentally used damp wheat which had sprouted to produce malted wheat. This produced a sweet-malted flavoured bread \u2013 and Veda bread was born.\nList of breads\nSunblest Veda on menu at top hotel - Belfast Today\nBBC page on Veda and Ormo bakery with many visitors' comments\nRecords of Gleneagles Maltings Ltd",

By 1824, The   Virginia Housewife by Mary Randolph was published containing a recipe for Soda Cake.\nAfter baking soda was developed in the US in 1846, breads, griddle cakes and scones with bicarbonate of soda, plus cream of tartar or tartaric acid, became popular in European countries.\nTraditional Irish bread was historically cooked on a griddle as flatbread because the domestic flours did not have the properties needed to rise effectively when combined with yeast. Baking soda offered an alternative, but its popularity declined for a time when imported high-gluten flours became available. Brown soda bread (served with smoked salmon) reappeared on luxury hotel menus in the 1960s. Modern varieties can be found at Irish cafes and bakeries, some made with Guinness, treacle, walnuts, and herbs, but the sweetened version with caraway and raisins is rarely seen anymore. Soda bread made with raisins is colloquially called \"Spotted Dog\" or \"Spotted Dick\".\nIn Ireland, the flour is typically made from soft wheat, so soda bread is best made with a cake or pastry flour (made from soft wheat), which has lower levels of gluten than a bread flour. In some recipes, the buttermilk is replaced by live yogurt or even stout. Because the leavening action starts immediately (compared to the time taken for yeast bread to rise), bakers recommend the minimum amount of mixing of the ingredients before baking; the dough should not be kneaded.\nVarious forms of soda bread are popular throughout Ireland. Soda breads are made using wholemeal, white flour, or both. In Ulster, the wholemeal variety is usually known as wheaten bread and is normally sweetened, while the term \"soda bread\" is restricted to the white savoury form. In the southern provinces of Ireland, the wholemeal variety is usually known as brown bread and is almost identical to the Ulster wheaten. In some parts of Fermanagh, the white flour form of the bread is described as fadge.\nThe \"griddle cakes\", \"griddle bread\" (or soda farls in Ulster) take a more rounded shape and have a cross cut in the top to allow the bread to expand. The griddle cake or farl is a more flattened type of bread. It is cooked on a griddle, allowing it to take a more flat shape, and it is split into four sections. The soda farl is one of the distinguishing elements of the Ulster fry, where it is served alongside potato bread, also in farl form.\nIn Scotland, varieties of soda breads and griddle sodas include bannocks and farls (Scots: fardel, \"a fourth\"), \"soda scones\", or \"soda farls\", using baking powder or baking soda as a leavening agent giving the food a light and airy texture.\nBannocks are flat cakes of barley or oatmeal dough formed into a round or oval shape, then cooked on a griddle (Scots: girdle). The most authentic versions are unleavened, but from the early 19th century bannocks have been made using baking powder, or a combination of baking soda and buttermilk or clabbered milk. Before the 19th century, bannocks were cooked on a bannock stone (Scots: stane), a large, flat, rounded piece of sandstone, placed directly onto a fire, then used as a cooking surface. Several varieties of bannock include Selkirk bannocks, beremeal bannocks, Michaelmas bannock, Yetholm bannock, and Yule bannock.\nThe traditional soda farl is used in the full Scottish breakfast along with the potato scone (Scots: tattie scone).\nIn Serbian tradition, soda bread is prepared by various rules and rituals. A coin is often put into the dough during the kneading; other small objects may also be inserted. At the beginning of Christmas dinner, the \u010desnica is rotated three times counter-clockwise, before being broken among the family members. The person",

Before the 19th century, bannocks were cooked on a bannock stone (Scots: stane), a large, flat, rounded piece of sandstone, placed directly onto a fire, then used as a cooking surface. Several varieties of bannock include Selkirk bannocks, beremeal bannocks, Michaelmas bannock, Yetholm bannock, and Yule bannock.\nThe traditional soda farl is used in the full Scottish breakfast along with the potato scone (Scots: tattie scone).\nIn Serbian tradition, soda bread is prepared by various rules and rituals. A coin is often put into the dough during the kneading; other small objects may also be inserted.

Before the creation of quick bread, baked goods were leavened either with yeast or by mixing dough with eggs. \"Fast bread\" is an alternate name.\nThe discovery or rediscovery of chemical leavening agents and their widespread military, commercial, and home use in the United States dates back to 1846 with the introduction of commercial baking soda in New York, by Church and Dwight of \"Arm & Hammer\" fame. This development was extended in 1856 by the introduction of commercial baking powder in Massachusetts, although perhaps the best known form of baking powder is \"Calumet\", first introduced in Hammond, Indiana and West Hammond, Illinois (later Calumet City, Illinois) in 1889. Both forms of food-grade chemical leaveners are still being produced under their original names, although not within the same corporate structure.\nDuring the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), the demand for portable and quickly-made food was high, while skilled labor for traditional breadmaking was scarce. This encouraged the adoption of bread which was rapidly made and leavened with baking soda, instead of yeast. The shortage of chemical leaveners in the American South during the Civil War contributed to a food crisis there.\nAs the Industrial Revolution accelerated, the marketing of mass-produced prepackaged foods was eased by the use of chemical leaveners, which could produce consistent products regardless of variations in source ingredients, time of year, geographical location, weather conditions, and many other factors that could cause problems with environmentally sensitive, temperamental yeast formulations. These factors were traded off against the loss of traditional yeast flavor, nutrition, and texture.\nPreparing a quick bread generally involves two mixing containers. One contains all dry ingredients (including chemical leavening agents or agent) and one contains all wet ingredients (possibly including liquid ingredients that are slightly acidic in order to initiate the leavening process). In some variations, the dry ingredients are in a bowl and the wet ingredients are heated sauces in a saucepan off-heat and cooled.\nDuring the chemical leavening process, agents (one or more food-grade chemicals\u2014usually a weak acid and a weak base) are added into the dough during mixing. These agents undergo a chemical reaction to produce carbon dioxide, which increases the baked good's volume and produces a porous structure and lighter texture. Yeast breads often take hours to rise, and the resulting baked good's texture can vary greatly based on external factors such as temperature and humidity. By contrast, breads made with chemical leavening agents are relatively uniform, reliable, and quick. Usually, the resulting baked good is softer and lighter than a traditional yeast bread.\nChemical leavening agents include a weak base, such as baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) plus a weak acid, such as cream of tartar, lemon juice, or cultured buttermilk, to create an acid\u2013base reaction that releases carbon dioxide. (Quick bread leavened specifically with baking soda is often called \"soda bread\".) Baking powder contains both an acid and a base in dry powdered form, and simply needs a liquid medium in which to react. Other alternative leavening agents are egg whites mechanically beaten to form stiff peaks, as in the case of many waffle recipes, or steam, in the case of cream puffs. Nevertheless, in a commercial process, designated chemical leavening acids and bases are used to make gas production consistent and controlled. Examples of acid\u2014base combinations include:\nAlmost all quick breads have the same basic ingredients: flour, leavening, eggs, fat (butter, margarine, shortening, or oil), and liquid such as milk. Ingredients beyond these basic constituents are added for variations in flavor and texture. The type of bread produced varies based predominantly on the method of mixing, the major flavoring, and the ratio of liquid in the batter. Some batters are thin enough to pour, and others thick enough to mold into lumps.\nThere are three basic methods for making quick breads, which may combine the \"rise\" of the chemical leavener with advantageous \"lift\" from other ingredients:\nThe stirring method (also known as the quick-bread method, blending method, or muffin method) is used for pancakes, muffins, corn bread, dumplings, and fritters. It calls for measurement of dry and wet ingredients separately, then quickly mixing the two. Often the wet ingredients include beaten eggs, which have trapped air that helps the product to rise. In these recipes, the fats are liquid, such as cooking oil. Usually mixing is done using a tool with a wide head such as a spoon or spatula to prevent the dough from becoming",

Soda bread is a variety of quick bread traditionally made in a variety of cuisines in which sodium bicarbonate (otherwise known as \"baking soda\", or in Ireland, \"bread soda\") is used as a leavening agent instead of the traditional yeast. The ingredients of traditional soda bread are flour, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk. The buttermilk in the dough contains lactic acid, which reacts with the baking soda to form tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide. Other ingredients can be added, such as butter, egg, raisins, or nuts. An advantage of quick breads is their ability to be prepared quickly and reliably, without requiring the time-consuming skilled labor and temperature control needed for traditional yeast breads.\nDuring the early years of European settlement of the Americas, settlers used soda or pearl ash, more commonly known as potash (pot ash) or potassium carbonate, as a leavening agent (the forerunner to baking soda) in quick breads. By 1824, The   Virginia Housewife by Mary Randolph was published containing a recipe for Soda Cake.\nAfter baking soda was developed in the US in 1846, breads, griddle cakes and scones with bicarbonate of soda, plus cream of tartar or tartaric acid, became popular in European countries.\nTraditional Irish bread was historically cooked on a griddle as flatbread because the domestic flours did not have the properties needed to rise effectively when combined with yeast. Baking soda offered an alternative, but its popularity declined for a time when imported high-gluten flours became available. Brown soda bread (served with smoked salmon) reappeared on luxury hotel menus in the 1960s. Modern varieties can be found at Irish cafes and bakeries, some made with Guinness, treacle, walnuts, and herbs, but the sweetened version with caraway and raisins is rarely seen anymore. Soda bread made with raisins is colloquially called \"Spotted Dog\" or \"Spotted Dick\".\nIn Ireland, the flour is typically made from soft wheat, so soda bread is best made with a cake or pastry flour (made from soft wheat), which has lower levels of gluten than a bread flour. In some recipes, the buttermilk is replaced by live yogurt or even stout. Because the leavening action starts immediately (compared to the time taken for yeast bread to rise), bakers recommend the minimum amount of mixing of the ingredients before baking; the dough should not be kneaded.\nVarious forms of soda bread are popular throughout Ireland. Soda breads are made using wholemeal, white flour, or both. In Ulster, the wholemeal variety is usually known as wheaten bread and is normally sweetened, while the term \"soda bread\" is restricted to the white savoury form. In the southern provinces of Ireland, the wholemeal variety is usually known as brown bread and is almost identical to the Ulster wheaten. In some parts of Fermanagh, the white flour form of the bread is described as fadge.\nThe \"griddle cakes\", \"griddle bread\" (or soda farls in Ulster) take a more rounded shape and have a cross cut in the top to allow the bread to expand. The griddle cake or farl is a more flattened type of bread. It is cooked on a griddle, allowing it to take a more flat shape, and it is split into four sections. The soda farl is one of the distinguishing elements of the Ulster fry, where it is served alongside potato bread, also in farl form.\nIn Scotland, varieties of soda breads and griddle sodas include bannocks and farls (Scots: fardel, \"a fourth\"), \"soda scones\", or \"soda farls\", using baking powder or baking soda as a leavening agent giving the food a light and airy texture.\nBannocks are flat cakes of barley or oatmeal dough formed into a round or oval shape, then cooked on a griddle (Scots: girdle).

Its distinct taste and look is in large part due to the addition of wort to the dough, making it similar to a malt loaf.  It is a typical dish for a traditional Christmas Eve sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord or julbord. Limpa bread pairs well with jams and jellies, or cream cheese.\nHistorically, this bread was leavened with fermented brewer's wort, hence its Swedish name v\u00f6rtlimpa or v\u00f6rtbr\u00f6d (\"wort loaf\" or \"wort bread\").

It is used as a filling in baking or normally  molded into shapes and coated with corn starch. The sugar confection is inspired by a historical medicinal confection made from Althaea officinalis, the marsh-mallow plant.\nThe word \"marshmallow\" comes from the mallow plant species (Althaea officinalis), a herb native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and Asia which grows in marshes and other damp areas. The plant's stem and leaves are fleshy, and its white flower has five petals. It is not known exactly when marshmallows were invented, but their history goes back as early as 2000\u00a0BCE. Ancient Egyptians were said to be the first to make and use the root of the plant to soothe coughs and sore throats and to heal wounds. The first marshmallows were prepared by boiling pieces of root pulp with honey until thick. Once thickened, the mixture was strained, cooled, then used as intended.\nWhether used for candy or medicine, the manufacture of marshmallows was limited to a small scale. In the early- to mid-1800s, the marshmallow had made its way to France, where confectioners augmented the plant's traditional medicinal value with indulgent ingredients utilized by the Egyptians. Owners of small candy stores would whip the sap from the mallow root into a fluffy candy mold. This candy, called P\u00e2te de Guimauve, was a spongy-soft dessert made from whipping dried marshmallow roots with sugar, water, and egg whites. It was sold in bar form as a lozenge. Drying and preparation of the marshmallow took one-to-two days before the final product was produced. In the late 1800s, candy makers started looking for a new process and discovered the starch mogul system, in which trays of modified corn starch had a mold firmly pushed down in them to create cavities within the starch. The cavities were then filled with the whipped marshmallow sap mixture and allowed to cool or harden. At the same time, candy makers began to replace the mallow root with gelatin which created a stable form of marshmallow.\nBy the early 1900s, thanks to the starch mogul system, marshmallows were introduced to the United States and available for mass consumption. They were sold in tins as penny candy and were soon used in a variety of food recipes like banana fluff, lime mallow sponge, and tutti frutti. In 1956, Alex Doumak patented the extrusion process which involved running marshmallow ingredients through tubes. The tubes created a long rope of marshmallow mixture and were then set out to cool. The ingredients were then cut into equal pieces and packaged.\nModern marshmallow manufacturing is highly automated and has been since the early 1950s when the extrusion process was first developed. Numerous improvements and advancements allow for the production of thousands of pounds of marshmallow a day. Today, the marshmallow typically consists of four ingredients: sugar, water, air, and a whipping agent (usually a protein). The type of sugar and whipping agent varies depending on desired characteristics. Each ingredient plays a specific role in the final product.\nConfectioners in early 19th century France pioneered the innovation of whipping up the marshmallow sap and sweetening it to make a confection similar to modern marshmallow. The confection was made locally by the owners of small sweet shops. They would extract the sap from the mallow plant's root and whip it themselves. The candy was very popular, but its manufacture was labour-intensive. In the late 19th century, French manufacturers thought of using egg whites or gelatin, combined with modified corn starch, to create the chewy base. This avoided the labour-intensive extraction process, but it did require industrial methods to combine the gelatin and corn starch in the right way.\nAnother milestone in the production of marshmallows was the development of the extrusion process by the Greek American confectioner Alex Doumak, of Doumak Inc., in the late 1940s. In this process, which Doumak patented in 1956, marshmallow mixture is pumped through extrusion heads with numerous ports aligned next to each other which form continuous \"ropes\" of marshmallow. This invention allowed marshmallows to be manufactured in a fully automated way and gives us the familiar cylindrical shape of today's marshmallow. To make marshmallows in large quantities, industrial confectioners mix water, sugar, and corn syrup in massive kettles which are then heated to a precise temperature and cooked for a precise time. This mixture is then pumped into another kettle to cool. Once the mixture has cooled enough to not denature the gelatin, the re-hydrated gelatin",

Traditional bread spices are anise,  caraway, fennel seeds and bitter orange.\nTypically baked during the Christmas season, the festive wort breads / loaves (Swedish: v\u00f6rtbr\u00f6d / v\u00f6rtlimpa)I are flavoured with spices like anise, caraway and fennel seeds, and often orange rinds, raisins or sultanas, and dark beer, in addition to the wort. Its distinct taste and look is in large part due to the addition of wort to the dough, making it similar to a malt loaf.  It is a typical dish for a traditional Christmas Eve sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord or julbord. Limpa bread pairs well with jams and jellies, or cream cheese.\nThe first step for making the bread is to bring molasses, brown sugar, caraway seeds, wort and water to a gentle boil, then to add shortening or butter and citrus rind. Once this mixture has cooled to a lukewarm temperature it is combined with activated yeast and rye flour. The dough rises and more flour is added to knead the dough in preparation for a second rise, then the tops are brushed with melted butter and the loaves are baked.  Some recipes add the molasses mixture to the dry ingredients after the rye flour has been scalded with hot water.\nJulekake\nList of breads\nList of Christmas dishes\nSmith, Leslie. \"Scandinavian Ideas for a South Dakota Christmas\".

The type of sugar and whipping agent varies depending on desired characteristics. The marshmallow is a foam, consisting of an aqueous continuous phase and a gaseous dispersed phase (in other words, a liquid with gas bubbles spread throughout). In addition to being a foam, this also makes marshmallows an \"aerated\" confection because it is made up of 50% air. The goal of an aerated confection like a marshmallow is to incorporate gas into a sugar mixture, and stabilize the aerated product before the gas can escape. When the gas is introduced into the system, tiny air bubbles are created. ...",

Marshmallow (UK: /m\u0251\u02d0r\u0283\u02c8m\u00e6lo\u028a/, US: /\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0r\u0283m\u025blo\u028a, -m\u00e6l-/) is a type of confectionery that is typically made from sugar, water and gelatin whipped to a solid-but-soft consistency. It is used as a filling in baking or normally  molded into shapes and coated with corn starch. The sugar confection is inspired by a historical medicinal confection made from Althaea officinalis, the marsh-mallow plant.\nThe word \"marshmallow\" comes from the mallow plant species (Althaea officinalis), a herb native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and Asia which grows in marshes and other damp areas. The plant's stem and leaves are fleshy, and its white flower has five petals. It is not known exactly when marshmallows were invented, but their history goes back as early as 2000\u00a0BCE. Ancient Egyptians were said to be the first to make and use the root of the plant to soothe coughs and sore throats and to heal wounds. The first marshmallows were prepared by boiling pieces of root pulp with honey until thick. Once thickened, the mixture was strained, cooled, then used as intended.\nWhether used for candy or medicine, the manufacture of marshmallows was limited to a small scale. In the early- to mid-1800s, the marshmallow had made its way to France, where confectioners augmented the plant's traditional medicinal value with indulgent ingredients utilized by the Egyptians. Owners of small candy stores would whip the sap from the mallow root into a fluffy candy mold. This candy, called P\u00e2te de Guimauve, was a spongy-soft dessert made from whipping dried marshmallow roots with sugar, water, and egg whites. It was sold in bar form as a lozenge. Drying and preparation of the marshmallow took one-to-two days before the final product was produced. In the late 1800s, candy makers started looking for a new process and discovered the starch mogul system, in which trays of modified corn starch had a mold firmly pushed down in them to create cavities within the starch. The cavities were then filled with the whipped marshmallow sap mixture and allowed to cool or harden. At the same time, candy makers began to replace the mallow root with gelatin which created a stable form of marshmallow.\nBy the early 1900s, thanks to the starch mogul system, marshmallows were introduced to the United States and available for mass consumption. They were sold in tins as penny candy and were soon used in a variety of food recipes like banana fluff, lime mallow sponge, and tutti frutti. In 1956, Alex Doumak patented the extrusion process which involved running marshmallow ingredients through tubes. The tubes created a long rope of marshmallow mixture and were then set out to cool. The ingredients were then cut into equal pieces and packaged.\nModern marshmallow manufacturing is highly automated and has been since the early 1950s when the extrusion process was first developed. Numerous improvements and advancements allow for the production of thousands of pounds of marshmallow a day. Today, the marshmallow typically consists of four ingredients: sugar, water, air, and a whipping agent (usually a protein). The type of sugar and whipping agent varies depending on desired characteristics. Each ingredient plays a specific role in the final product.\nConfectioners in early 19th century France pioneered the innovation of whipping up the marshmallow sap and sweetening it to make a confection similar to modern marshmallow. The confection was made locally by the owners of small sweet shops. They would extract the sap from the mallow plant's root and whip it themselves. The candy was very popular, but its manufacture was labour-intensive. In the late 19th century, French manufacturers thought of using egg whites or gelatin, combined with modified corn starch, to create the chewy base. This avoided the labour-intensive extraction process, but it did require industrial methods to combine the gelatin and corn starch in the right way.\nAnother milestone in the production of marshmallows was the development of the extrusion process by the Greek American confectioner Alex Doumak, of Doumak Inc., in the late 1940s. In this process, which Doumak patented in 1956, marshmallow mixture is pumped through extrusion heads with numerous ports aligned next to each other which form continuous \"ropes\" of marshmallow. This invention allowed marshmallows to be manufactured in a fully automated way and gives us the familiar cylindrical shape of today's marshmallow. To make marshmallows in large quantities, industrial confectioners mix water, sugar, and corn syrup in massive kettles which are then heated to a precise temperature and cooked for a precise time. This mixture is then pumped into another kettle to cool. Once the mixture has cooled enough to not denature the gelatin, the re-hydrated gelatin",

                "description": "The main ingredient in a standard lollipop is sugar. Sugars are fully hydrated carbon chains, meaning that there is a water molecule attached to each carbon. Sugars come in two forms; straight-chain and ring form. When sugars are in straight-chain form, aldehyde and ketone groups are open which leaves them very susceptible to reaction. In this state, sugars are unstable. In ring form, sugars are stable and therefore exist in this form in most foods, including lollipops. Sugar is a very versatile ingredient and is used in a wide variety of food products. Sugar interacts differently depending on the presence of other ingredients and on various treatments. ...",

A lollipop is a type of sugar candy usually consisting of hard candy mounted on a stick and intended for sucking or licking. Different informal terms are used in different places, including lolly, sucker, sticky-pop, etc. Lollipops are available in many flavors and shapes.\nLollipops are available in a number of colors and flavors, particularly fruit flavors. With numerous companies producing lollipops, the candy now comes in dozens of flavors and many different shapes. Lollipops can range from very small candies bought in bulk and given away as a courtesy at banks, barbershops, and other locations, to very large treats made from candy canes twisted into a spiral shape.\nMost lollipops are eaten at room temperature, but \"ice lollipops\", \"ice lollies\", or \"popsicles\" are frozen water-based lollipops. Similar confections on a stick made of ice cream, often with a flavored coating, are usually not called by this name.\nSome lollipops contain fillings, such as bubble gum or soft candy. Some novelty lollipops have more unusual items, such as mealworm larvae, embedded in the candy.\nOther novelty lollipops have non-edible centers, such as a flashing light embedded within the candy; there is also a trend, principally in North America, of lollipops with sticks attached to a motorized device that makes the candy spin around in one's mouth.\nIn the Nordic countries, Germany, and the Netherlands, some lollipops are flavored with salmiak.\nLollipops can be used to carry medicines.\nSome lollipops have been marketed for use as diet aids, although their effectiveness is untested, and anecdotal cases of weight loss may be due to the power of suggestion. Flavored lollipops containing medicine are intended to give children medicine without fuss.\nActiq is a powerful analgesic lollipop whose active ingredient is fentanyl. Often, patients utilizing large amounts of opioid pain medication take Actiq lozenges on a handle in order to control breakthrough cancer pain.\nThe idea of an edible candy on a stick is very simple, and it is probable that the lollipop has been invented and reinvented numerous times. The first confectioneries that closely resemble what we call lollipops date to the Middle Ages, when the nobility would often eat boiled sugar with the aid of sticks or handles.\nThe invention of the modern lollipop is still something of a mystery but a number of American companies in the early 20th century have laid claim to it. According to the book Food for Thought: Extraordinary Little Chronicles of the World, they were invented by George Smith of New Haven, Connecticut, who started making large hard candies mounted on sticks in 1908. He named them after a racehorse of the time, Lolly Pop - and trademarked the lollipop name in 1931.\nThe term 'lollipop' was recorded by English lexicographer Francis Grose in 1796. The term may have derived from the term \"lolly\" (tongue) and \"pop\" (slap). The first references to the lollipop in its modern context date to the 1920s. Alternatively, it may be a word of Romany origin being related to the Roma tradition of selling candy apples on a stick. Red apple in the Romany language is loli phaba.\nWhile the main functional ingredients of a lollipop are quite simple, the process of making such confections can be complex. The formation and physical state of the glassy amorphous structure used in the creation of the lollipop is an involved chemical process. The first step in making lollipops after mixing the main ingredients is the heating process. During heating, the molecules increase in their translational mobility and therefore begin to resemble liquids. Although many hard candies are heated to about 310\u02daF, the temperature that the solution is heated to is dependent on the specific volume and contents of the mixture. After heating is complete, the solution can then be cooled. The final cooled solution is a supersaturated due to the moisture content dropping below 2%. Supersaturated or supercooled liquids are also formed  due to inhibitors preventing crystallization. They are unstable because crystallization is a favored reaction in this case. During the cooling process, the most important physicochemical characteristic of lollipops, the glass transition process, occurs.\nGlass transition is the solid-liquid transformation of amorphous material. It is a reversible change of the solid and liquid states of supercooled liquids. Glass transition occurs approximately 100\u02daC-150\u02daC below the equilibrium melting temperature of a pure substance. This dynamic transition is not a change of state, but a change of phase. It can be looked at in terms of a change in the molecular motion of the liquid, not a change in the molecular order itself. This",

It is used as a filling in baking or normally  molded into shapes and coated with corn starch. The sugar confection is inspired by a historical medicinal confection made from Althaea officinalis, the marsh-mallow plant.\nThe word \"marshmallow\" comes from the mallow plant species (Althaea officinalis), a herb native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and Asia which grows in marshes and other damp areas. The plant's stem and leaves are fleshy, and its white flower has five petals. It is not known exactly when marshmallows were invented, but their history goes back as early as 2000\u00a0BCE. Ancient Egyptians were said to be the first to make and use the root of the plant to soothe coughs and sore throats and to heal wounds. The first marshmallows were prepared by boiling pieces of root pulp with honey until thick. Once thickened, the mixture was strained, cooled, then used as intended.\nWhether used for candy or medicine, the manufacture of marshmallows was limited to a small scale. In the early- to mid-1800s, the marshmallow had made its way to France, where confectioners augmented the plant's traditional medicinal value with indulgent ingredients utilized by the Egyptians. Owners of small candy stores would whip the sap from the mallow root into a fluffy candy mold. This candy, called P\u00e2te de Guimauve, was a spongy-soft dessert made from whipping dried marshmallow roots with sugar, water, and egg whites. It was sold in bar form as a lozenge. Drying and preparation of the marshmallow took one-to-two days before the final product was produced. In the late 1800s, candy makers started looking for a new process and discovered the starch mogul system, in which trays of modified corn starch had a mold firmly pushed down in them to create cavities within the starch. The cavities were then filled with the whipped marshmallow sap mixture and allowed to cool or harden. At the same time, candy makers began to replace the mallow root with gelatin which created a stable form of marshmallow.\nBy the early 1900s, thanks to the starch mogul system, marshmallows were introduced to the United States and available for mass consumption. They were sold in tins as penny candy and were soon used in a variety of food recipes like banana fluff, lime mallow sponge, and tutti frutti. In 1956, Alex Doumak patented the extrusion process which involved running marshmallow ingredients through tubes. The tubes created a long rope of marshmallow mixture and were then set out to cool. The ingredients were then cut into equal pieces and packaged.\nModern marshmallow manufacturing is highly automated and has been since the early 1950s when the extrusion process was first developed. Numerous improvements and advancements allow for the production of thousands of pounds of marshmallow a day. Today, the marshmallow typically consists of four ingredients: sugar, water, air, and a whipping agent (usually a protein). The type of sugar and whipping agent varies depending on desired characteristics. Each ingredient plays a specific role in the final product.\nConfectioners in early 19th century France pioneered the innovation of whipping up the marshmallow sap and sweetening it to make a confection similar to modern marshmallow. The confection was made locally by the owners of small sweet shops. They would extract the sap from the mallow plant's root and whip it themselves. The candy was very popular, but its manufacture was labour-intensive. In the late 19th century, French manufacturers thought of using egg whites or gelatin, combined with modified corn starch, to create the chewy base. This avoided the labour-intensive extraction process, but it did require industrial methods to combine the gelatin and corn starch in the right way.\nAnother milestone in the production of marshmallows was the development of the extrusion process by the Greek American confectioner Alex Doumak, of Doumak Inc., in the late 1940s. In this process, which Doumak patented in 1956, marshmallow mixture is pumped through extrusion heads with numerous ports aligned next to each other which form continuous \"ropes\" of marshmallow. This invention allowed marshmallows to be manufactured in a fully automated way and gives us the familiar cylindrical shape of today's marshmallow. To make marshmallows in large quantities, industrial confectioners mix water, sugar, and corn syrup in massive kettles which are then heated to a precise temperature and cooked for a precise time. This mixture is then pumped into another kettle to cool. Once the mixture has cooled enough to not denature the gelatin, the re-hydrated gelatin",

Ka'\u00ed Ladrillo is a typical dessert of the Paraguayan cuisine prepared mainly with peanuts and molasses.\nThe name ka\u2019i ladrillo is the result of the combination of two words, \u201cka\u2019i\u201d that means \u201cmonkey\u201d and \u201cladrillo\u201d that is brick, used to refer to all things with that shape.

Takoyaki was first popularized in Osaka, where a street vendor named Tomekichi Endo is credited with its invention in 1935. Takoyaki was inspired by akashiyaki, a small round dumpling from the city of Akashi in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture made of an egg-rich batter and octopus. Takoyaki was initially popular in the Kansai region, and later spread to the Kant\u014d region and other areas of Japan. Takoyaki is associated with yatai street food stalls, and there are many well-established takoyaki specialty restaurants, particularly in the Kansai region. Takoyaki is now sold at commercial outlets, such as supermarkets and 24-hour convenience stores.\nIt is also very popular in Taiwanese cuisine due to the historical influence of Japanese culture.\nThe oldest known takoyaki store is Aizuya in Osaka. Founded by Tomakichi Endo, it has been open since the 1930s. The first takoyaki included beef and konjac, but later Endo switched to using the now traditional octopus and added flavor to the batter. The takoyaki are then eaten with brown sauce, similar to Worcestershire sauce. The food, known as \"octopus balls\", quickly became popular throughout Japan.\nA takoyaki pan (\u305f\u3053\u713c\u304d\u5668, takoyaki-ki) or\u2014much more rarely\u2014takoyaki-nabe (\u305f\u3053\u713c\u304d\u934b) is typically a griddle made of cast iron with hemispherical molds. The heavy iron evenly heats the takoyaki, which are turned with a pick during the heating process to pull the uncooked batter to the base of the rounded cavity. Commercial gas-fueled takoyaki cookers are used at Japanese festivals or by street vendors. For home use, electric versions resemble a hotplate; stovetop versions are also available.\nA children's book named Takoyaki Mantoman published in the 1990s and later adapted into an anime television series produced by Studio Pierrot that aired from April 1998 to September 1999.\nTakoyaki was featured on the Netflix Television series, Street Food, in the Osaka, Japan episode.\n\nList of seafood dishes\nSimilar global dishes\n\u00c6bleskiver in Denmark\nCekodok in Malaysia\nPoffertjes in Netherlands\nKue cucur in Indonesia\nUnniyappam and neyyappam (both sweet dishes) and paddu (plain or spicy but vegan) in India\n\"\u86f8\u713c\" [Takoyaki].

                "description": "A sope ([so.pe]) is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a fried masa base with savory toppings. Also known as picadita (in Tierra Caliente, Guerrero), it originates in the central and southern parts of Mexico, where it was sometimes first known as pellizcadas. It is an antojito, which at first sight looks like an unusually thick tortilla with vegetables and meat toppings. The masa base is fried with pinched sides and topped with refried beans, crumbled cheese, lettuce, onions, red or green sauce and sour cream. Sometimes other ingredients (mostly meat) are also added to create different tastes and styles.",

The sope has spread throughout all Mexico's territory, and thousands of regional variants are made. Even though Sopes are traditionally from Mexico, many Central American countries have adopted this delicious dish into their cuisine, with slightly different ingredients, and very similar to Salvadoran enchiladas. \nWhile the pinched sides of the sope are its most distinctive characteristic,  flat sopes are made to resemble a thick tortilla or a tostada. However, though both tostadas and sopes are fried, the tostada is thin and fried until it becomes crunchy and fragile, while the sope is much thicker and fried only until the exterior surface is cooked. The sope, therefore, has a soft, slightly pliable texture. The sope's thickness is meant to support its toppings, and the frying of its exterior surface adds resistance to the moisture of the ingredients.\nThe most common variation of the sope involves simply adding chicken and is widely known as a sope de pollo.  Sopes topped with beef are also a common variation and are typically slightly larger than sopes de pollo.\nIn the northern regions of Mexico, sopes are often prepared without vegetables, substituting black beans, spicy salsa, and longaniza or chorizo, instead.  In Acapulco and Guerrero, sopes are unusually small in size, so they are called sopecitos instead, and are fried in the same oil used to fry seafood, which gives them a unique taste. Sopecitos are made of beans and salsa only; no other ingredients are added.\nIn Oaxaca, sopes sometimes are prepared using chapulines (roasted grasshoppers) as topping. Also, an extremely large dish similar to a giant sope or a giant tostada is the traditional food of reference in Oaxaca known as tlayuda.\nThe sope has been adopted and adapted to the local tastes of all Mexico's regions. This resulted in the creation of many traditional food specialties, which may appear to resemble the sope, but are considered a different dish.\nThe most common variation is the huarache, which is prepared in almost the same manner. However, the huarache normally is two or three times as large as a sope and has a characteristic oblong shape. Huaraches are usually topped with rib, chicken, or beefsteak meat. The name huarache is derived from the shape of the masa, similar to the popular sandals. Toppings for the huarache include beans, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, ground beef, and salsa.\nThe tlacoyo is a completely different traditional Mexican dish which must not be confused with a sope, but in some regions has started to be used in a similar way, as a base on top of which are placed the same ingredients used for sopes. A tlacoyo is an oval fried or toasted cake made of masa, torpedo-shaped and a lot fatter, since it is filled with beans or cheese.\nSince it is similar in shape to a huarache (but smaller), and is made of the same corn as the sope and is even thicker (so it has more resistance to humid foods), Mexican street vendors decided to sell it adding toppings on it, as an alternative to the sope. However, the traditional tlacoyo it is supposed to be consumed without any toppings on it, and this form is mostly found as street food.\nGarnachas are small corn tortillas fried with shredded meat, crumbled dried cheese, and salsa. In many instances, garnachas may only have chopped onion and salsa on top. Similar in appearance to sopes, they are a main specialty from Guatemala.\nOaxacan memelas are a local name for the identical sopes served in other parts of Mexico, just made with different toppings. Memelas are corn masa cakes topped with beans, salsa, shredded cabbage, mole negro, guacamole, and cheese. Memelas have been served at Oaxacan/Mexican restaurants in the United States since the 1990s. In Puebla, they are often served by topping the fried masa with sauce - red sauce on one side and green sauce on the other side which is called estilo bandera.  Instead of meat, memelas in Puebla are served with sour cream, crumbled cheese, and diced onions on top of the red and green sauces.\nA chalupa is a tostada platter in Mexican cuisine, not a sope, but its preparation method is quite similar. It is a specialty of south-central Mexico, such as the states of Puebla, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. It is made by pressing a thin layer of masa dough around the outside of a small mold and deep frying to produce a crisp, shallow corn cup. It is filled with various ingredients such as shredded chicken, pork, chopped onion, chipotle pepper, red salsa, and green salsa.\nThe chalupa is usually longer than a sope, resembling the canoe-like boat that is its namesake, although small versions (named chalupitas) are available in other regions. An Americanized form is sold in",

Huaraches originated in Mexico City in about the early 1930s. Their origin was at a stall along La Viga navigation channel, where Mrs. Carmen Gomez Medina prepared tlacoyos. When the navigation channel was covered to make the \"Calzada de la Viga\", Mrs. Gomez moved to another place and after 1957, when the Mercado de Jamaica was founded, she moved there, and then to a little place at Torno street. Because Mrs. Gomez's new invention was shaped differently than a sope or a tlacoyo, people started to call it \"huarache\".\nList of Mexican dishes\n\u00a0food portal\n\"Archived copy\".

Ka'\u00ed Ladrillo is a typical dessert of the Paraguayan cuisine prepared mainly with peanuts and molasses.\nThe name ka\u2019i ladrillo is the result of the combination of two words, \u201cka\u2019i\u201d that means \u201cmonkey\u201d and \u201cladrillo\u201d that is brick, used to refer to all things with that shape.

Natchitoches meat pies are often fried in peanut oil because of that oil's high smoking temperature. A number of restaurants in the historic district in Natchitoches serve meat pies, and frozen pies are available from grocers in northern Louisiana. It has a savory meat filling in a crescent-shaped, flaky wheat pastry turnover. It is similar to a Spanish picadillo beef empanada. Varieties are found throughout the colonies of the Spanish Empire. The Natchitoches meat pie is nearly identical to the traditional ground beef empanada of Argentina, Empanada de Carne. ...",

The Natchitoches meat pie is a regional dish from northern Louisiana, United States. It is one of the official state foods of Louisiana.\nIn the modern recipe, ground pork or pork sausage is blended into the ground beef for additional flavor.  Onions, bell pepper and when used garlic and parsley provide aromatics. Ground black pepper and cayenne pepper are added to get attention without being uncomfortable. Flour is added to the browned meat and vegetable mixture to dry, thicken and loosely bind the filling. The meat filling can be used in other foods (e.g., tacos, tamales, enchiladas, stuffed bell pepper et al) but the wheat turnover crust is a defining element. The traditional size is approximately 4 ounces (by weight) on a 5\"-6\" diameter pastry dough (with the dough circles being cut, traditionally, using an empty coffee can). The filling should be made the day before to allow the flavors of the ingredients to meld. Filling, dough and tools should be chilled before assembly. Warm filling will cause the dough to disintegrate.\nIn the first part of the 20th century, meat pies were sold from home kitchens or from carts by street vendors. By 1967, Natchitoches meat pies were produced in commercial kitchens. Now, they may be ordered online.\nLouisiana Public Broadcasting aired a program January 20, 2007, describing how to make Natchitoches meat pies. It is available on DVD entitled \"A Taste of Louisiana with Chef John Folse & Company:  Our Food Heritage - The Spanish Shows\". An annual Meat Pie Festival, held in September, celebrates the Natchitoches meat pie. It includes pie making demonstrations, a meat pie cook-off, live music and more.\nCrawfish pie\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nPistolette\nLaws of Louisiana, LL 170.9, 2003.\n\"Report\". inside.sfuhs.org.\n\"Common Empanada Mistakes\".

Tchaka or Chaka is a Haitian stew made from hominy, beans, pumpkin (joumou), and meat (usually pork). It is used as an offering to the loa in Haitian Vodou. The nutritious soup is also associated with festivities and family time.\nOther names for the dish are tyaka, chaka, or tiaka depending on the region. Typical of Haitian cuisine, this dish has influences of many different cultures.\nTchaka is relatively simple to make. However, it often requires several hours of preparation to allow flavors to develop and incorporate throughout the soup. Unlike other soups where the ingredients are prepared in the same pot, for tchaka, the ingredients are usually cooked separately before being combined. This is because the different ingredients have different cooking times. The red beans and corn are soaked for several hours. The pork is boiled then grilled in oil. Then the beans, corn, and meat are combined and simmered at low heat for about two hours. The tchaka is simmered to the desired consistency which is usually on the thicker side. Some add pumpkin to the tchaka, where a cooked piece of pumpkin is pureed and added to the other ingredients before simmering. The stew is served hot. It is sometimes served with a pickle on the side.\nSeveral other local variations exist which use beef, mutton, or crab instead of pork. Some recipes use coconut milk which provides a creamy consistency. Some recipes use squash, yam, or malanga.\nTchaka is usually served during special occasions because it requires a relatively long time to prepare. For example, it can be served during family gatherings. It can also be served on November 1 for All Saints\u2019 Day, on May 1 for Labor Day to honor Azakah Medeh, the loa of harvest and agriculture. In Haitian Vodou, tchaka was the favorite dish of this loa.\nTchaka was mentioned in a song by Haitian musician, Sydney Guillaume, when he wrote: \n\u201cChofe dife! Nou pral manje tchaka! Chofe dife, brase mayi, pa bliye tisale, Nou pral manje yon bon tchaka. Nou pral voye monte yon bouyon t\u00e8t chaje\u201d (\u201cLight the fire! We will eat tchaka! Light the fire, mix the corn, don\u2019t forget the salted pork, we will eat a delicious tchaka, we will cook an incredible stew\u201d).\nHaitians oftentimes cook tchaka during school vacations since it is protein-rich and thought to help with children\u2019s growth.\nList of soups\nFoundation, A.R.C.

So the \u201cka\u2019i ladrillo\u201d is the \u201cbrick of the monkey\u201d because it is usually made with a rectangular form like a brick and because the monkey (ka\u2019i mirikina) is an animal natural of the Paraguayan jungles that likes to eat everything that is sweet. And this dessert is especially sweet. It is also called \u201cazukap\u00e9 manduv\u00ed\u201d, Guaran\u00ed words for \u201csugar\u201d (azuk\u00e1), \u201cflat\u201d (p\u00e9) and \u201cpeanut\u201d (manduv\u00ed).\nTo prepare the ka\u2019i ladrillo are needed: toast peanuts and molasses.

Oatmeal and treacle are generally considered distinctive features of Lancashire parkin, whilst Yorkshire Parkin is baked using golden syrup, treacle and soft brown sugar. The flour used in parkin in England is self-raising, containing a small amount of chemical leavening agent. If this is not available, or if the proportion of oatmeal is high, it is essential to add a leavening agent, e.g. baking powder or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar. One of the key features of parkin is that it retains its texture well. ...",

Parkin is a gingerbread cake traditionally made with oatmeal and black treacle, which originated in northern England. Often associated with Yorkshire.  it is very widespread and popular elsewhere, notably in Lancashire. Parkin is baked to a hard cake but with resting becomes moist and even sometimes sticky. In Hull and East Yorkshire, it has a drier, more biscuit-like texture than in other areas. Parkin is traditionally eaten on Guy Fawkes Night, 5 November,  but is also enjoyed throughout the winter months. It is baked commercially throughout Yorkshire, but is mainly a domestic product in other areas.\nThe origin of the word parkin is unknown. The first published dated reference to parkin was collected from 1728 from the West Yorkshire Quarter Sessions when Anne Whittaker was accused of stealing oatmeal to make parkin. The Lancashire schoolmaster and poet Tim Bobbin describes tharf cake in 1740, and this is recognisable as a parkin. A possible older use of parkin is in the seventeenth century ballad  'The song of Arthur O'Bradley'  that purports to describe a merry wedding from the time of Robin Hood (fourteenth century)\nWhen Arthur, to make their hearts merry\n\nBrought ales and parkin and perry.\nThe tharf cake is of ancient Teutonic origin, as tharf or theorf meant 'unleavened, un-fermented, solid tough or sodden' in Old English. John Wycliffe in his translation of the Bible in 1389 (Mark Ch.14.v. 1) calls unleavened bread a \"tharf loove\"\nParkin is virtually unknown in the south of England. It is eaten in an area where oats were the staple grain for the poor, rather than wheat. It is closely related to tharf cake \u2013 an unsweetened cake cooked on a griddle rather than baked. The traditional time of the year for tharf cakes to be made  was directly after the oat harvest in the first week in November. For festive occasions, the cake would be sweetened with honey. In the seventeenth century (about 1650) sugar started to be imported from Barbados, and molasses was a by-product of the refining process. Molasses was first used by apothecaries; to make a medicine theriaca, from which name the word treacle is derived. As molasses became plentiful, or treacle as it became called at that time, it was substituted for honey in the preparation of tharf cakes.\nIn Northern Europe honey was used as a medicine, for festive cakes and making mead; before 1750 sweetness was not a characteristic of everyday food. Honey cakes had a special festive significance. They were baked to be hard, but after storage for a couple of weeks they regained their moisture becoming soft and even sticky. Molasses has hygroscopic properties. German Lebkuchen and Pfefferkuchen were other examples of hygroscopic holiday ginger-breads. They too were baked hard in summer and allowed to moisten for consumption at Christmas.\nThough parkin and tharf cake appear to be synonymous, all parkins generally were sweet tharf cakes.\nParkin and tharf cake were used interchangeably in Lancashire and South Yorkshire until 1900. Over the 500 years the recipe and taste of these cakes have changed considerably.  It was the food of the poor. Ovens were rare in the houses of the poor, and they generally had no access to public bakers before the 1820s, so the cakes were cooked on griddles or bakestones on an open fire. The best parkin was made with fresh oatmeal, which fixes the date around the first week in November.\nIn southern Lancashire and West Yorkshire, parkin is inextricably linked to the Guy Fawkes Night celebration. Jennifer Stead, in her study Prodigal Frugality, identifies the link between Guy Fawkes and parkin as the bonfire. The first two weeks in November had many Christian festivals, and like Celtic festivals that preceded them they were celebrated with a fire and ritual cakes. November starts with All Hallows Eve, that runs into All Saints Day (1 November), which is followed by All Souls Day (2 November).  Little Lent and the forty-day fast until Christmas, started at Martinmas. (11 November). On All Souls Day soul cakes were baked. The Martinmas fair was important being the traditional day when cattle were bought and sold, and servants were hired for the following year. It was also the date that cattle were slaughtered and salted to preserve them for the winter and for general feasting and dancing.\nThe Celtic festival of Samain, the festival of the dead on 1 November, was celebrated with special cakes and bonfires. It was Christianised into All Hallows by the church in 837 A.D., and the culinary tradition continued. When Guy Fawkes in 1605 gave the English church a reason to celebrate with a bonfire, the tradition was adopted under the new name, just four days later on 5 November.

Trail mix or scroggin is a type of snack mix, typically a combination of granola, dried fruit, nuts, and sometimes candy, developed as a food to be taken along on hikes. Trail mix is considered an ideal snack food for hikes, because it is lightweight, easy to store, and nutritious, providing a quick energy boost from the carbohydrates in the dried fruit or granola, and sustained energy from fats in nuts.\nThe combination of nuts, raisins and chocolate as a trail snack dates at least to the 1910s, when outdoorsman Horace Kephart recommended it in his popular camping guide.\nIn New Zealand, trail mix is known as \"scroggin\" or \"schmogle\". In Australia, the term \"scroggin\" is used exclusively, although in more recent years, \"trail mix\" has been imported into the jargon from the USA. Some claim that the name stands for sultanas, carob, raisins, orange peel, grains, glucose, and nuts or alternatively sultanas, chocolate, raisins and other goody-goodies including nuts; but this may be a backronym.\nThe American word gorp, a term for trail mix often used by hikers in North America, is typically said to be an acronym for \"good ol' raisins and peanuts\", although the mix may contain M&M's and other nuts. The Oxford English Dictionary cites a 1913 reference to the verb gorp, meaning \"to eat greedily\", so the \"good ol' raisins and peanuts\" explanation may be folk etymology.\nIn Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and several other European countries, trail mix is called \"student fodder\", \"student oats\", or \"student mix\" in the local languages and usually does not include chocolate. In Iran mixed nuts is called \"ajil\", eaten at festivals like Yald\u0101 Night or just a social \"mehmooni\".\nSnack mix\nSnacking\nKephart, Horace (1916).

Jollof (/d\u0292\u0259\u02c8l\u0252f/), or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions.\nThe origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. The dish has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables. \nFood and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in \"linguistic, historical or political patterns\". \nInstead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of \"blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy\" as well as the religion of Islam. \nMarc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia. \nIt may then have spread throughout the region through the historical commercial, cultural and religious channels linking Senegal with Ghana, Nigeria and beyond, many of which continue to thrive today, such as the Tij\u0101niyyah Sufi brotherhood bringing thousands of West African pilgrims to Senegal annually.\nJollof rice is one of the most common dishes in West Africa. There are several regional variations in name and ingredients, for example, in Mali it is called zaam\u00e8 in Bamanankan. The dish's most common name of Jollof derives from the name of the Wolof people, though in Senegal and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as ceebu j\u00ebn or benachin. In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras. Despite the variations, the dish is \"mutually intelligible\" across the regions and has become the best known African dish outside the continent.\nEach West African country has at least one variant form of the dish, with Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cameroon particularly competitive as to which country makes the best jollof. This is especially prominent between Nigeria and Ghana, in a rivalry dubbed the \"Jollof Wars\".\nAlthough considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian jollof rice includes long grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, pepper, vegetable oil, onions, and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are cooked in one pot, of which a rich meat stock and a fried tomato and pepper puree characteristically forms the base. Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid. The dish is then served with the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi moi, steamed vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc. In the riverine areas of Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein, seafood often takes the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice.\nGhanaian jollof rice is made of vegetable oil, onion, bell pepper, cloves of pressed garlic, chillies, tomato paste, beef or goat meat or chicken (some times alternated with mixed vegetables), local or refined rice and black pepper. The method of cooking jollof begins with first preparing the beef or chicken by seasoning and frying it until it is well-cooked. The rest of the ingredients are then fried all together, starting from onions, pepper, tomato paste, tomatoes and spices in that order. After all the ingredients have been fried, rice is then added and cooked until the meal is prepared. Ghanaian jollof is typically served with side dishes of beef, chicken, well-seasoned fried fish, or mixed vegetables.\nJollof in Ghana is also served alongside shito, a popular type of pepper which originates from Ghana, and salad during parties and other ceremonies.\nSince the 2010s there has been increasing interest in West African foods in the western world. Jollof food festivals have been held in Washington, DC, in the US, and Toronto, Canada. \"World Jollof Day\" has been celebrated since 2015 on 22 August, gaining traction on social media.\nCharleston red rice\nJambalaya\nList of African dishes\nThieboudienne\nAyto, John (2012). \"Jollof rice\".

The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. The dish has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables. \nFood and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in \"linguistic, historical or political patterns\". \nInstead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of \"blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy\" as well as the religion of Islam. \nMarc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia. \nIt may then have spread throughout the region through the historical commercial, cultural and religious channels linking Senegal with Ghana, Nigeria and beyond, many of which continue to thrive today, such as the Tij\u0101niyyah Sufi brotherhood bringing thousands of West African pilgrims to Senegal annually.\nJollof rice is one of the most common dishes in West Africa. There are several regional variations in name and ingredients, for example, in Mali it is called zaam\u00e8 in Bamanankan. The dish's most common name of Jollof derives from the name of the Wolof people, though in Senegal and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as ceebu j\u00ebn or benachin. In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras. Despite the variations, the dish is \"mutually intelligible\" across the regions and has become the best known African dish outside the continent.\nJollof rice traditionally consists of rice, cooking oil, vegetables such as tomato, onion, red pepper, garlic, ginger and scotch bonnet chilli peppers. To enhance the colour of the dish, tomato paste (pur\u00e9e) is added. As seasoning spices, salt, seasoning/stock cubes (a blend of flavour enhancers, salt, nutmeg and herbs), curry powder and dried thyme are used. To complement the dish, chicken, turkey, beef or fish are often served with the dish.\nEach West African country has at least one variant form of the dish, with Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cameroon particularly competitive as to which country makes the best jollof. This is especially prominent between Nigeria and Ghana, in a rivalry dubbed the \"Jollof Wars\".\nAlthough considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian jollof rice includes long grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, pepper, vegetable oil, onions, and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are cooked in one pot, of which a rich meat stock and a fried tomato and pepper puree characteristically forms the base. Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid. The dish is then served with the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi moi, steamed vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc. In the riverine areas of Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein, seafood often takes the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice.\nGhanaian jollof rice is made of vegetable oil, onion, bell pepper, cloves of pressed garlic, chillies, tomato paste, beef or goat meat or chicken (some times alternated with mixed vegetables), local or refined rice and black pepper. The method of cooking jollof begins with first preparing the beef or chicken by seasoning and frying it until it is well-cooked. The rest of the ingredients are then fried all together, starting from onions, pepper, tomato paste, tomatoes and spices in that order. After all the ingredients have been fried, rice is then added and cooked until the meal is prepared. Ghanaian jollof is typically served with side dishes of beef, chicken, well-seasoned fried fish, or mixed vegetables.\nJollof in Ghana is also served alongside shito, a popular type of pepper which originates from Ghana, and salad during parties and other ceremonies.\nSince the 2010s there has been increasing interest in West African foods in the western world. Jollof food festivals have been held in Washington, DC, in the US, and Toronto, Canada. \"World Jollof Day\" has been celebrated since 2015 on 22 August, gaining",

The customary gifts of fish in crust prevailed in 1530, when the prior of Llanthony, Gloucester, baked eels and carp into a pie for Henry VIII.

The exact origin of the frito pie is not completely clear. It is believed that it was created somewhere in Mexico and was popular at fiestas before it took off in other countries like the United States.\nThe oldest known recipe using Fritos brand corn chips with chili was published in Texas in 1949. The recipe may have been invented by Daisy Doolin, the mother of the founder of the Frito Corporation (Doolin) and the first person to use Fritos as an ingredient in cooking, or by Mary Livingston, Doolin's executive secretary. The Frito-Lay company attributes the recipe to Nell Morris, who joined Frito-Lay in the 1950s and helped develop an official cookbook which included the Frito pie.\nDoolin and his Frito Corporation were early investors in Disneyland, which opened Casa de Fritos restaurant in Disneyland in 1955. \"Frito Chili Pie\" appears on the 1950s menu. \nAnother story claims that true Frito pie originated only in the 1960s with Teresa Hern\u00e1ndez, who worked at the F. W. Woolworth's lunch counter in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Her Frito pie used homemade red chile con carne with cheddar cheese and onions, and was served in the bag, which was thicker in the 1960s than it is now.\nFrito pie is a simple dish: At its most basic, it is just an amount of Fritos corn chips with beef chili as a topping. It was historically served by some right inside the chip bag, which is split down the middle; toppings typically include shredded cheese and chopped raw onion, and may also include additional items like sour cream and jalape\u00f1os.\n\nFrito Pies are sometimes referred to by the name walking taco or Frito boat, and can be made in a small, single-serving bag of corn chips, with chili, taco meat, chickpeas, pork rinds, pepitas, and many other varied ingredients, poured over the top. The combination can be finished with grated cheese, onions, jalape\u00f1os, lettuce, and sour cream, known as a Frito boat or walking taco in the Midwestern United States. In the Ohio Valley region, this preparation is commonly called taco-in-a-bag. (\"Walking taco\" or \"traveling taco\", however, is the more widespread term at least in the Midwest). In many parts of Southern California, they are known as \"pepper bellies.\" Frito pies are popular at sports venues, fundraisers, bingos, open houses, state fairs, and street vendors. The term Tostiloco comes from Tijuana, and is found in California. Another term is Doriloco, after Doritos.\nIn Mexico, a version of the dish is known as tostilocos (\"crazy chips\"). It is topped with cueritos, cucumber, j\u00edcama, lime juice, Valentina hot sauce, chamoy, Taj\u00edn chili powder, salt, and \"Japanese peanuts\".\nHaystacks\nTaco salad\nTamale pie\nTostilocos\nPetro's Chili & Chips, a Knoxville, Tennessee-based fast food chain serving a frito pie variant first served at the 1982 World's Fair.\nHarris, Joyce (13 June 2007). \"The allure of Frito Pie\".

Shops specialize in freshly made empanadas, with many flavors and fillings.\nEvery region of Argentina has its own characteristic variant.\nThose of Salta are small, juicy and spicy, and contain potatoes, peppers and ground chili. The Jujuy variant adds peas and garlic. Its filling is called \"recado\" and the repulgue (the way of closing the empanada) \"simbado\".

Originating from the town of Amatrice (in the mountainous Province of Rieti of Lazio region), the Amatriciana is one of the best known pasta sauces in present-day Roman and Italian cuisine.

Amatriciana originates from a recipe named pasta alla gricia. In the papal Rome, the grici were sellers of common edible foods, and got this name because many of them came from Valtellina, at that time possession of the Swiss canton of Grigioni. According to another hypothesis, the name originates from the hamlet of Grisciano, in the comune of Accumoli, near Amatrice. The sauce\u2014nowadays named also Amatriciana bianca \u2014was (and still is) prepared with guanciale (cured pork cheek) and grated pecorino romano. At some point, a little olive oil was added to the recipe. In the 1960s, the Amatriciana sauce was still prepared in this way in Amatrice itself.\nThe invention of the first tomato sauces (and the  likely earliest date for the introduction of tomato in the gricia, creating the Amatriciana) dates back to the late 18th century.  The first written record of pasta with tomato sauce can be found in the 1790 cookbook L'Apicio Moderno by Roman chef Francesco Leonardi.\nThe Amatriciana recipe became increasingly famous in Rome over the 19th and early 20th centuries, due to the centuries-old connection between Rome and Amatrice. The recipe was extremely well received and rapidly went on to be considered a classic of Roman cuisine, even though it originated elsewhere. The name of the dish in the Romanesco dialect eventually became matriciana due to the apheresis typical of this dialect.\nWhile tomato-less gricia is still prepared in central Italy, it is the tomato-enriched amatriciana that is better known throughout Italy and exported everywhere. While in Amatrice the dish is prepared with spaghetti, the use of bucatini has become extremely common in Rome and is now prevalent. Other types of dry pasta (particularly rigatoni) are also used, whereas fresh pasta is generally avoided.\nThe recipe is known in several variants depending, among other things, on the local availability of certain ingredients. In Amatrice, the use of guanciale and tomato, onion is not favored, but is shown in the classical handbooks of Roman cuisine.  For frying, olive oil is most commonly used, but strutto (canned pork lard) is used as well. In Amatrice, the local pecorino is sometimes used as cheese.\nThe addition of garlic sauteed in olive oil, before adding the guanciale is also accepted, and for cheese either pecorino romano or Amatrice's pecorino (from the Monti Sibillini or Monti della Laga areas) can be used. The addition of black or chili pepper is common.\nList of pasta dishes\nList of pork dishes\nList of sauces\nRavaro (2005), p. 395\n\"Publication of an application for registration of a name pursuant to Article 50(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs (2019/C 393/04)\".

It is a play on words on the colloquial reduction of \"para ver\" (meaning \"to look at\") to \"pa ve\", similar in sound to pav\u00ea. The joke means, simultaneously, \"is [the dessert] to look at, or to eat?\" and \"is [the dessert] pav\u00ea, or to eat?\".\n\nTiramisu\nList of Brazilian sweets and desserts\nRochadel, Andr\u00e9 (27 December 2020). \"Pav\u00ea, panetone, chocotone, rabanada: qual a origem desses doces festivos?\".

Bosnian pot (Bosnian: Bosanski lonac) is a Bosnian vegetable stew, a culinary speciality appreciated for its rich taste and flexibility. Recipes for Bosanski lonac vary greatly according to personal and regional preference, but the main ingredients generally include chunked meat and vegetables. Mixed meats may be used in the dish. It has been described as a national dish of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nBosanski lonac has been on tables of both the rich and the poor for hundreds of years. The wealthy prepared the dish with more meat and other expensive ingredients, while the poor used what was available. Typical ingredients are: beef, lamb, bell peppers, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, parsley, garlic, peppercorns (whole, not ground). Many different vegetables or meats may be used. Bosanski lonac is prepared by layering meat and vegetables (alternating layers of meat and vegetables until the pot is full) into a deep pot, then adding 1 - 2 dl of water. The ingredients are usually cut into large pieces rather than finely chopped or minced.\nBosnian cuisine\nList of stews\nIrish stew\nPichelsteiner\nNikujaga\nAlbala, K. (2011).

Geng dishes have been important in Chinese cuisine since early dynastic China, during or prior to the Shang Dynasty (1600 BC -1046 BC). In the past, the term \"geng\" was used to refer to any cooked soup or stew, with households serving it daily and for festive events.\nIn modern times, geng dishes consist of different ingredients commonly found in the night markets of Taiwan, and quite commonly in Fujian and Taiwanese cuisine. In Taiwan, the character for geng is sometimes written as \"\u713f\" and sometimes as \"\u7cb3\".\nThe Lao (\u0ec1\u0e81\u0e87, [k\u01e3ng]) and Thai language (\u0e41\u0e01\u0e07, [g\u025b\u025bng]) terms for curry, stew, or soup, are believed to have been derived from the Middle Chinese pronunciation of geng (\u7fb9). The Vietnamese term for soup, canh (e.g., canh chua), descends from the Sino-Vietnamese form of \u7fb9.\nDue to its cultural prevalence, the food has been featured in various Chinese cultural sayings and idioms:\n\"Share a cup of geng\" (\u5206\u4e00\u676f\u7fb9): To boldly partake in a pool of profit or spoils, regardless of the pleasantness or the morality of these profits' origin.  The expression is typically attributed to Liu Bang's infamous rebuff against Xiang Yu during the Chu-Han contention.  Xiang had previous routed Liu's army and captured his family as hostages, and publicly threatened to cook Liu's father alive if he refuses to surrender.  Liu responded humiliatingly (and rather shamelessly) by pointing out that he and Xiang were once sworn brothers, and if Xiang was willing to commit patricide by killing \"our father\", then \"share me a cup of geng when you are done cooking\".\n\"Shop-closing geng\" (\u9589\u9580\u7fb9): To shoo-off clients or guests that a host does not wish to receive by a disingenuous action or excuse.\n\"Washing hands to make geng\" (\u6d17\u624b\u4f5c\u7fb9\u6e6f): From a poem of Wang Jian, implying the trials of a new bride to appease and gain acceptance in her new family.\nThe traditional Chinese spoon is called \"di\u00e0o g\u0113ng\" (\u8abf\u7fb9), which means \"the implement that carries geng\".\nList of Chinese soups\nList of soups\nY\u014dkan\nDowner, G.B.

The first English usage\u2014\"quiche Lorraine\"\u2014was recorded in 1925.  The further etymology is uncertain but it may be related to the German Kuchen meaning \"cake\" or \"tart\".\nQuiche is considered a French dish; however, using eggs and cream in pastry was practised in English cuisine at least as early as the 14th century and Italian cuisine at least as early as the 13th century. Recipes for eggs and cream baked in pastry containing meat, fish and fruit are referred to Crustardes of flesh and Crustade in the 14th-century The Forme of Cury and in 15th-century cookbooks, such as the Italian Libro de arte coquinaria.\nQuiche has a pastry crust and a filling of eggs and milk and/or cream. It can be made with vegetables, meat, seafood and some may be made without crust.\nQuiche lorraine (named after the Lorraine region of France) is a popular variant that was originally an open pie with eggs, cream and lardons. In English-speaking countries, modern preparations of the dish usually include mature cheese (Cheddar cheese often being used in British varieties), and the lardons are replaced by bacon.\nThere are many variants of quiche, using a wide variety of ingredients. Variants may be named descriptively, often in French, e.g. quiche au fromage (quiche with cheese) and quiche aux champignons (quiche with mushrooms) or conventionally, e.g. florentine (spinach) and proven\u00e7ale (tomatoes).\nPie\nBacon and egg pie\nList of pies, tarts and flans\n\"quiche\", Oxford English Dictionary, OUP 2015.

It is specific to the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and primarily eaten in April and May, during the annual seal hunt. Although in the past, seal flippers were usually acquired directly from the boats that were used for the seal hunt (since they were considered a by-product of the seal fur trade), today they are usually purchased in grocery stores. Seal meat has been described as tasting like rabbit or dark meat chicken, and fans of its flavour tend to be people who grew up eating it.",

A deep-fried Oreo is a dessert or snack consisting of a chocolate sandwich cookie which is dipped in batter and deep fried. It may be served with different toppings, most commonly powdered sugar. Deep-fried Oreos are generally made using Oreo-brand cookies, hence the name, but other chocolate sandwich cookies can be used.\nControversy abounds as to who first invented deep-fried Oreos. Skylar R. claims to have fried them first for his best fried who has never had them before. From there, they showed up at the Iowa State Fair in 2002. Deep-fried Oreos were later introduced independently in 2004 by Delia, also known as \"Chicken girl\" or \"The Girl Who Fries Everything,\" a 16-year-old Armenian settled in the United States, at the L.A. County Fair. Delia dipped Oreos in pancake batter, deep fried them, drizzled them with chocolate syrup and served them with powdered sugar. \"There are many other fried foods at the fair, but I specialize in it. I make it my life,\" Delia said about deep-fried food. Aside from the deep-fried Oreo, she has also introduced new types of deep-fried food every year in different state fairs.\nSince the debut of the deep-fried Oreo, it has now become very common at carnivals and is a \"cult favorite.\"\nNumerous variations of deep-fried Oreos have been derived from the typical recipe since its debut, including bacon deep-fried Oreos (deep-fried Oreos which are wrapped in slices of bacon); deep-fried Oreo ice cream, in which ice cream covered with egg mixture and crushed Oreo cookies is deep fried; and deep-fried Oreo burgers, which take the form of a deep-fried Oreo within a burger (including the patty) alongside other fillings, such as bacon.\nIn 2013, the deep-fried Oreo won the Annual Big Tex Choice in the State Fair of Texas.\nDeep-fried Oreos were also introduced on TV shows and viral videos by some celebrities. In 2012, a popular Taiwanese variety show by the name of Kangsi Coming also publicized the deep-fried Oreo. In the programme, an American talked about deep-fried Oreos, referring to it as one of the most popular foods in Taiwanese night markets.\nIn 2013, on The Jay Leno Show, Kim Kardashian cooked deep-fried Oreos with Guy Fieri and said about it: \"It's like a once-a-year snack.\"\nYuka Kinoshita, a famous Japanese competitive eater, filmed a YouTube video of herself eating over 30 deep-fried Oreos in 2016. The video has exceeded 3 million views.\nThe deep-fried Oreo has become worldwide since its debut in 2002 at the Los Angeles County Fair and Texas State Fair. Outside of its birthplace, the United States, the deep-fried Oreo has been available in different countries all over the world, including Australia, Canada, Dubai, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.\nDeep-fried foods have been criticized for being linked to various health problems, since they are usually high in calories, fat (including saturated fat), and cholesterol. For instance, the saturated fat and trans fat in deep-fried foods increase the risk of high cholesterol, heart disease, cancer and obesity. As such, deep-fried Oreos have aroused health controversies. Five deep-fried Oreos contain 900 calories and have a total of 51 grams of sugar, 950\u00a0mg of sodium, and 48 grams of fat.\nDeep-fried Oreos are included in a junk food encyclopedia titled Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of What We Love to Eat by Andrew F. Smith.\nList of deep fried foods\nhttps://www.press-citizen.com/story/entertainment/2015/12/18/neuzil-reveals-origins-deep-fried-oreo/77505660/ \n\"Shatkin, E. (2009, September 02).

It consists of thin vermicelli-sized noodles made from starch in a semi-frozen syrup containing sugar and rose water. Faloodeh is often served with lime juice and sometimes ground pistachios. \nIn Iran, faloodeh is sold in ice cream stores and coffee shops in flavors such as pistachio, saffron, rosewater and honey, and can be served alongside bastani sonnati, a traditional Persian ice cream.

Faloodeh is an Arabicized form of paloodeh that appeared after the Arab conquest of Iran, due to a lack of the phoneme /p/ in Standard Arabic. In Arab medieval sources, it was known as Faloothaj (Arabic: \u0641\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0630\u064e\u062c\u200e, romanized:\u00a0F\u0101l\u016b\u1e0fa\u01e7) for example in Al-Mu\u1e25kam wa-al-mu\u1e25\u012bt al-a\u02bb\u1e93am.\nIn the 16th to 18th centuries, the Indo-Persian Mughal kings who ruled South Asia created a cold dessert beverage called falooda, which is a derivative of faloodeh.\n\u00a0Food portal\n\u00a0Iran portal\nDan Jurafsky (November 16, 2011). \"Macarons, Macaroons, Macaroni: The curious history\".

A dark caramel erbet is poured over the prepared bread. It is important to prepare the bread correctly to maximize absorption of the erbet. When the bread has fully absorbed the erbet it softens.

The dessert is based around manjar blanco, a similar confection to dulce de leche, itself coming from blancmange, a dish from the Middle Ages. Blancmange came to Peru from Spain. It consisted of a thick cream made of milk, sugar, almond flour and some Iberian ingredients. An even older recipe had it made of chicken breast boiled in milk, almonds and thickened with flour and was meant as a bland food for the sick and weak. The other element of the Suspiro de Lime\u00f1a is meringue, also brought to Peru by the Spaniards.\nThe dessert is consumed mainly in Lima and in other Peruvian cities. It is a staple of Peruvian restaurants abroad.\nList of desserts\n\nRecipe example",

A date shake is a milkshake made with dates. The drink originated in, and is particularly associated with, the Coachella Valley in California.\nAt the end of the 19th century into the beginning of the 20th, plant explorers from the USDA were sent to search globally for new crops that could be farmed in North America. These explorers returned with date palms from North Africa and the Middle East. The explorer, Walter Swingle brought back six medjool date offshoots from a Moroccan oasis; these six offshoot specimens \"account for all the megool dates grown in the US.\"  \nIn 1928, Russ Nicholl (sometimes spelled Nichol) and his family built a roadside shack near Thermal, California. Another news source states that Nichol built his shack in 1919. A few years later, this shack was expanded and named Valerie Jean after Nicholl's daughter. With electricity and refrigeration, the Nicholls were able to offer variations of ingredients blended with their supply of dates. Nichol was reportedly inspired by stories of nomads in the Middle East who he heard \"lived entirely on dates and goat\u2019s milk\".\nIn 1924 Floyd and Bess Shields opened the Shields Date Garden in Indio to compete with the quickly growing date industry in Coachella Valley.\nThe Coachella Valley has numerous date shake shops, many of them are located on Highway 111. The small desert town of Westmoreland, where medjool dates are grown, and Indio, where Shields is located, are known for their date shakes. The drink has been called the \"unofficial drink of the Coachella Valley\" or the \"unofficial drink of Palm Springs.\"\nThey are a popular drink at the Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival and during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.\nBleiberg, Larry (2 May 2018). \"The Worlds Ultimate Milkshake?\".

Pichelsteiner is a German stew that contains several kinds of meat and vegetables.\nThe creation of this dish has been traced to Auguste Winkler (n\u00e9e Kiesling).  Originally from Kirchberg im Wald, she worked as an innkeeper in Grattersdorf, where she is also buried.\nThe name is likely to have derived from the nearby B\u00fcchelstein mountain, where the annual B\u00fcchelsteiner Fest has been celebrated since 1839. As early as the 40th anniversary in 1879, the open-air-cooking festival was considered a tradition, and because the letter \u00fc is pronounced like i in the local dialect, the dish's name developed.\nIn Regen, a town in the Bavarian Forest, the citizens have met annually since 1874 on Kirchweih Monday to eat Pichelsteiner together, a tradition that is still alive today. They also claim the name's etymology. In their opinion, it derives from the pot in which the stew is cooked, which was called a pichel in the past, but this version is highly questioned by Bavarian researcher Max Peinkofer.\nThe dish was first mentioned in a cookbook in 1894.\nBavarian cuisine\nBosnian pot\nIrish stew\nList of stews\nNikujaga\nSwabian cuisine\nMax Peinkofer, \"B\u00fcchelsteinerfest und B\u00fcchelsteinerfleisch\" [The festival and meats of B\u00fcchelstein (a mountain in Bavaria, Germany)] in: Der Brunnkorb [a fountain in the town of Tittling, Bavaria, Germany], (Passau, Germany: Verlag Passavia, 1977), ISBN\u00a03-87616-060-X\nArticle in German",

A club sandwich, also called a clubhouse sandwich, is a sandwich of bread (traditionally toasted), sliced cooked poultry, ham or fried bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise. \nIt is often cut into quarters or halves and held together by cocktail sticks. Modern versions frequently have two layers which are separated by an additional slice of bread.\nThe club sandwich may have originated at the Union Club of New York City. The earliest known reference to the sandwich, an article that appeared in The Evening World on November 18, 1889, is also an early recipe: \"Have you tried a Union Club sandwich yet? Two toasted pieces of Graham bread, with a layer of turkey or chicken and ham between them, served warm.\"  Several other early references also credit the chef of the Union Club with creating the sandwich.\nAnother theory is that the club sandwich was invented at the Saratoga Club in Saratoga Springs, New York, after Richard Canfield bought it and made it into the Canfield Casino in 1894. \nOther sources find the origin of the club sandwich to be up for debate.\nThe sandwich appeared on U.S. restaurant menus as early as 1899. The earliest reference to the sandwich in published fiction is from Conversations of a Chorus Girl, a 1903 book by Ray Cardell. Historically, club sandwiches featured slices of chicken, but with time, turkey has become increasingly common. An 1897 recipe has three layers, with the chicken and ham separated not by a slice of bread, but by a lettuce leaf.\nDagwood sandwich\nList of sandwiches\nBreene, Sophia (March 19, 2013). \"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the Club Sandwich\".

A Dagwood sandwich is a tall, multilayered sandwich made with a variety of meats, cheeses, and condiments. It is named after Dagwood Bumstead, a central character in the comic strip Blondie, who is frequently illustrated making enormous sandwiches. According to Blondie scripter Dean Young, his father, Chic Young, began drawing the huge sandwiches in the comic strip during 1936.\nIn 1951, businessmen Bob Weiler and Art Lang opened a Dagwood-themed restaurant in Toledo, Ohio, with hopes of establishing a national chain. They had not licensed the Dagwood name and were ordered to stop using it by King Features.\nA Dagwood Diner (spelled \"Dag-Wood\") operated in Ann Arbor, Michigan, until 1971.\nAssorted lunch meats featuring Dagwood have been sold at grocery stores. In May 1999, a counter-service restaurant named Blondie's opened at Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure, serving a traditional Dagwood-style sandwich. Blondie's bills itself as \"Home of the Dagwood Sandwich.\" The exterior displays a 20-foot plastic Dagwood sandwich over the entrance.\nDenny's in the early 2000s offered their breakfast Dagwood; it contained over a thousand calories. It was later removed from their menu.\nDagwood's Sandwich Shoppes, a Blondie-themed restaurant chain founded in 2006, had franchise locations open in Florida, Kentucky, Indiana, Missouri, and Georgia that have all closed as of 2011. The chain struggled financially and never reached the growth anticipated by its founders. Two lawsuits were filed alleging mismanagement, fraud, embezzlement, and deliberate deception of the chain's financial state as it collapsed. The Dagwood was sold as a 1.5-pound sandwich. The Dagwood sandwich served in the Dagwood Sandwich Shoppes included the following ingredients: three slices of deli bread, Genoa salami, ham, pepperoni, turkey, cheddar cheese, provolone, lettuce, tomato, roasted red bell peppers, banana peppers, red onion, deli mustard, and low calorie mayonnaise.\nCincinnati-based chain Penn Station East Coast Subs refers to its \"create-it-yourself\" submarine sandwich as a Dagwood. A customer may include up to five meats, and any combination of available condiments and vegetables.\nDagwoods are also a popular sandwich in South African takeaway (fast-food) restaurants and roadhouses, both in small street-side stands and larger chains. A South African Dagwood is usually made with three slices of toasted bread with a hamburger patty (or two), along with lettuce, tomato, and a fried egg. Other common accoutrements may be added and the beef patty may be replaced by savory mince reminiscent of an American sloppy joe, but it seems to be the fried egg and double-decker nature of the sandwich that characterizes a South African Dagwood.\nIn 2008, Man v. Food host Adam Richman visited Columbus, Ohio, and partook in the Ohio Deli and Restaurant's Dagwood Challenge. The challenge was to eat a 2-1\u20442-pound Dagwood sandwich, plus a full pound of French fries, within 30 minutes. Richman successfully ate the sandwich and fries in 20 of the 30 minutes and was awarded with commemorative T-shirt.\nDagwood's Deli and Sub Shop opened in Indiana in 1985, now serving several locations.  On the menu is a \"Dagwood Supreme\", which includes roast beef, ham, turkey, provolone and Colby cheeses, lettuce, tomato, and onions and a \"Dagwood\" sauce.\nDagwoods Sandwichs et Salades is a fast-food chain operating in Canada. It was founded in 1989 in Montr\u00e9al but subsequently expanded throughout Qu\u00e9bec and into Eastern Ontario.\nCaspar Milquetoast\nDream of the Rarebit Fiend\nJiggs dinner\nList of American sandwiches\nList of sandwiches\nSandwich loaf, a type of party food made from a whole loaf of bread\n\"History of Dagwood Sandwich\".

A Dagwood sandwich is a tall, multilayered sandwich made with a variety of meats, cheeses, and condiments. It is named after Dagwood Bumstead, a central character in the comic strip Blondie, who is frequently illustrated making enormous sandwiches. According to Blondie scripter Dean Young, his father, Chic Young, began drawing the huge sandwiches in the comic strip during 1936.\nIn 1951, businessmen Bob Weiler and Art Lang opened a Dagwood-themed restaurant in Toledo, Ohio, with hopes of establishing a national chain. They had not licensed the Dagwood name and were ordered to stop using it by King Features.\nA Dagwood Diner (spelled \"Dag-Wood\") operated in Ann Arbor, Michigan, until 1971.\nAssorted lunch meats featuring Dagwood have been sold at grocery stores. In May 1999, a counter-service restaurant named Blondie's opened at Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure, serving a traditional Dagwood-style sandwich. Blondie's bills itself as \"Home of the Dagwood Sandwich.\" The exterior displays a 20-foot plastic Dagwood sandwich over the entrance.\nDenny's in the early 2000s offered their breakfast Dagwood; it contained over a thousand calories. It was later removed from their menu.\nDagwood's Sandwich Shoppes, a Blondie-themed restaurant chain founded in 2006, had franchise locations open in Florida, Kentucky, Indiana, Missouri, and Georgia that have all closed as of 2011. The chain struggled financially and never reached the growth anticipated by its founders. Two lawsuits were filed alleging mismanagement, fraud, embezzlement, and deliberate deception of the chain's financial state as it collapsed. The Dagwood was sold as a 1.5-pound sandwich. The Dagwood sandwich served in the Dagwood Sandwich Shoppes included the following ingredients: three slices of deli bread, Genoa salami, ham, pepperoni, turkey, cheddar cheese, provolone, lettuce, tomato, roasted red bell peppers, banana peppers, red onion, deli mustard, and low calorie mayonnaise.\nCincinnati-based chain Penn Station East Coast Subs refers to its \"create-it-yourself\" submarine sandwich as a Dagwood. A customer may include up to five meats, and any combination of available condiments and vegetables.\nDagwoods are also a popular sandwich in South African takeaway (fast-food) restaurants and roadhouses, both in small street-side stands and larger chains. A South African Dagwood is usually made with three slices of toasted bread with a hamburger patty (or two), along with lettuce, tomato, and a fried egg. Other common accoutrements may be added and the beef patty may be replaced by savory mince reminiscent of an American sloppy joe, but it seems to be the fried egg and double-decker nature of the sandwich that characterizes a South African Dagwood.\nIn 2008, Man v. Food host Adam Richman visited Columbus, Ohio, and partook in the Ohio Deli and Restaurant's Dagwood Challenge. The challenge was to eat a 2-1\u20442-pound Dagwood sandwich, plus a full pound of French fries, within 30 minutes. Richman successfully ate the sandwich and fries in 20 of the 30 minutes and was awarded with commemorative T-shirt.\nDagwood's Deli and Sub Shop opened in Indiana in 1985, now serving several locations.  On the menu is a \"Dagwood Supreme\", which includes roast beef, ham, turkey, provolone and Colby cheeses, lettuce, tomato, and onions and a \"Dagwood\" sauce.\nDagwoods Sandwichs et Salades is a fast-food chain operating in Canada. It was founded in 1989 in Montr\u00e9al but subsequently expanded throughout Qu\u00e9bec and into Eastern Ontario.\nCaspar Milquetoast\nDream of the Rarebit Fiend\nJiggs dinner\nList of American sandwiches\nList of sandwiches\nSandwich loaf, a type of party food made from a whole loaf of bread\n\"History of Dagwood Sandwich\".

Mashed carrots is a dish prepared by cooking and then mashing carrots. Milk, butter, salt and pepper are commonly mixed in after the carrots are mashed.  Carrots can also be roasted in the oven before mashing. Other mashed vegetables may be added to the mashed carrots. These include onions, parsnips, turnips, squash, and rutabaga. Mashed potatoes may be mashed along with mashed carrots.\nTo create mashed carrots, the carrots are prepared and cut into a uniform size and boiled, steamed or roasted. The cooked carrots then can be mashed in a food processor or by hand with a potato masher. In addition, canned carrots can be used to prepare mashed carrots. Mashed carrots are served hot.\nMashed carrots may be served as a side dish. They are a major ingredient in carrot muffins, carrot cookies and carrot souffle. Mashed carrots are used in the home for baby food  and in commercially prepared 'baby' food.\nList of carrot dishes\nMashed potatoes\nMashed pumpkin\n\"Mashed Carrots \u00ab\u00a0Grimmway Farms\". www.grimmway.com.

Olivier salad (Russian: \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442 \u041e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044c\u0435, tr. salat Olivye) is a traditional salad dish in Russian cuisine, which is also popular in other post-Soviet countries and around the world. In different modern recipes, it is usually made with diced boiled potatoes, carrots, brined dill pickles (or cucumber), green peas, eggs, celeriac, onions, diced boiled chicken or bologna sausage (sometimes ham or hot dogs), and tart apples, with salt, pepper, and mustard added to enhance flavor, dressed with mayonnaise. In many countries, the dish is commonly referred to as Russian salad. A variation called Stolichny salad (Russian: \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442 \"\u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439\", \"capital city salad\") exists, and is also popular in the Russian cuisine.\nIn Russia and other post-Soviet states, as well as in Russophone communities worldwide, the salad has become one of the main dishes on zakuski tables served during New Year's Eve (\"Novy God\") celebrations.\nThe original version of the salad was invented in the 1860s by a cook of Belgian origin, Lucien Olivier, the chef of the Hermitage, one of Moscow's most celebrated restaurants. Olivier's salad quickly became immensely popular with Hermitage regulars, and became the restaurant's signature dish.\nThe exact recipe\u2014particularly that of the dressing\u2014was a zealously guarded secret, but it is known that the salad contained grouse, veal tongue, caviar, lettuce, crayfish tails, capers, and smoked duck, although it is possible that the recipe was varied seasonally. The original Olivier dressing was a type of mayonnaise, made with French wine vinegar, mustard, and Proven\u00e7al olive oil; its exact recipe, however, remains unknown.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, one of Olivier's sous-chefs, Ivan Ivanov, attempted to steal the recipe. While preparing the dressing one evening in solitude, as was his custom, Olivier was suddenly called away. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Ivanov sneaked into Olivier's private kitchen and observed his mise en place, which allowed him to make reasonable assumptions about the recipe of Olivier's famed dressing. Ivanov then left Olivier's employ and went to work as a chef for Moskva, a somewhat inferior restaurant, where he began to serve a suspiciously similar salad under the name \"metropolitan salad\" (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439, tr. Stolichny). It was reported by the gourmands of the time, however, that the dressing on the \"Stolichny\" salad was of a lower quality than Olivier's, meaning that it was \"missing something.\"\nLater, Ivanov sold the recipe for the salad to various publishing houses, which further contributed to its popularization. Due to the closure of the Hermitage restaurant in 1905, and the Olivier family's subsequent departure from Russia, the salad could now be referred to as \"Olivier.\"\nOne of the first printed recipes for Olivier salad, by Aleksandrova, appearing in 1894, called for half a hazel grouse, two potatoes, one small cucumber (or a large cornichon), 3\u20134 lettuce leaves, 3 large crayfish tails, 1/4 cup cubed aspic, 1 teaspoon of capers, 3\u20135 olives, and 11\u20442 tablespoon Proven\u00e7al dressing (mayonnaise).\nAs often happens with gourmet recipes which become popular, the ingredients which were rare, expensive, seasonal, or difficult to prepare were gradually replaced with cheaper and more readily available foods.\nToday's popular version of Olivier salad\u2014containing boiled potatoes, dill pickles, peas, eggs, carrots, and boiled beef/chicken or bologna, dressed with mayonnaise\u2014is a version of Ivanov's Stolichny salad, and only faintly resembles Olivier's original creation. This version was a staple of any Soviet holiday dinner, especially of a Novy God (New Year's Eve) dinner (to the extent that its presence was considered on a par with Soviet Champagne or mandarin oranges), due to availability of components in winter. Even though more exotic foods are widely available in Russia now, its popularity has hardly diminished: this salad was and maybe still is the most traditional dish for the home New Year celebration for Russian people.\nFestive Russian and post-Soviet states' homemade versions are traditionally at the cook's whim. While some of the ingredients are considered to be basic and essential, others are either favoured or dismissed as a threat to supposed authenticity.\nThe biggest Olivier salad, weighing 1841 kg, was prepared in December 2012 in Orenburg.\nEuropean cafes and delicatessens often provide an entire range of Olivier-style salads. Additionally, cafeterias, convenience stores, and truck stops sell a number of sub-par factory packaged or locally made versions, mostly extremely simple, using basic ingredients with cheap mayonnaise-like dressing.\nIn Serbia Olivier salad is called russian salad",

A customer may include up to five meats, and any combination of available condiments and vegetables.\nDagwoods are also a popular sandwich in South African takeaway (fast-food) restaurants and roadhouses, both in small street-side stands and larger chains. A South African Dagwood is usually made with three slices of toasted bread with a hamburger patty (or two), along with lettuce, tomato, and a fried egg. Other common accoutrements may be added and the beef patty may be replaced by savory mince reminiscent of an American sloppy joe, but it seems to be the fried egg and double-decker nature of the sandwich that characterizes a South African Dagwood.\nIn 2008, Man v. Food host Adam Richman visited Columbus, Ohio, and partook in the Ohio Deli and Restaurant's Dagwood Challenge. The challenge was to eat a 2-1\u20442-pound Dagwood sandwich, plus a full pound of French fries, within 30 minutes. Richman successfully ate the sandwich and fries in 20 of the 30 minutes and was awarded with commemorative T-shirt.\nDagwood's Deli and Sub Shop opened in Indiana in 1985, now serving several locations.  On the menu is a \"Dagwood Supreme\", which includes roast beef, ham, turkey, provolone and Colby cheeses, lettuce, tomato, and onions and a \"Dagwood\" sauce.\nDagwoods Sandwichs et Salades is a fast-food chain operating in Canada. It was founded in 1989 in Montr\u00e9al but subsequently expanded throughout Qu\u00e9bec and into Eastern Ontario.\nCaspar Milquetoast\nDream of the Rarebit Fiend\nJiggs dinner\nList of American sandwiches\nList of sandwiches\nSandwich loaf, a type of party food made from a whole loaf of bread\n\"History of Dagwood Sandwich\".

                "description": "Devil's food cake traditionally uses unsweetened chocolate baking squares in lieu of unsweetened cocoa powder. However, contemporary recipes typically use cocoa powder for its convenience over the more traditional chocolate baking squares. Also, because of its reduced amount of cocoa butter, cocoa powder has a more intense chocolate flavor than unsweetened chocolate. Moreover, coffee is frequently added as a liquid to enhance the chocolate flavor. Some recipes use hot or boiling water as the cake's main liquid, rather than milk. Its antithetical counterpart, the angel food cake, is a very light white cake that uses stiffly beaten egg whites and no dairy. ...",

Devil's food cake is a moist, rich chocolate layer cake. It is considered a counterpart to the white or yellow angel food cake. Because of differing recipes and changing ingredient availability over the course of the 20th century, it is difficult to precisely qualify what distinguishes devil's food from the more standard chocolate cake, though it traditionally has more chocolate than a regular chocolate cake, making it darker in colour and with a heavier texture. The cake is usually paired with a rich chocolate frosting.\nDevil's food cake was invented in the United States in the early twentieth century, with the recipe in print as early as 1905.\nAngel food cake\nList of desserts\nMississippi mud pie\nRed velvet cake\nJudith M.

A Dagwood sandwich is a tall, multilayered sandwich made with a variety of meats, cheeses, and condiments. It is named after Dagwood Bumstead, a central character in the comic strip Blondie, who is frequently illustrated making enormous sandwiches. According to Blondie scripter Dean Young, his father, Chic Young, began drawing the huge sandwiches in the comic strip during 1936.\nIn 1951, businessmen Bob Weiler and Art Lang opened a Dagwood-themed restaurant in Toledo, Ohio, with hopes of establishing a national chain. They had not licensed the Dagwood name and were ordered to stop using it by King Features.\nA Dagwood Diner (spelled \"Dag-Wood\") operated in Ann Arbor, Michigan, until 1971.\nAssorted lunch meats featuring Dagwood have been sold at grocery stores. In May 1999, a counter-service restaurant named Blondie's opened at Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure, serving a traditional Dagwood-style sandwich. Blondie's bills itself as \"Home of the Dagwood Sandwich.\" The exterior displays a 20-foot plastic Dagwood sandwich over the entrance.\nDenny's in the early 2000s offered their breakfast Dagwood; it contained over a thousand calories. It was later removed from their menu.\nDagwood's Sandwich Shoppes, a Blondie-themed restaurant chain founded in 2006, had franchise locations open in Florida, Kentucky, Indiana, Missouri, and Georgia that have all closed as of 2011. The chain struggled financially and never reached the growth anticipated by its founders. Two lawsuits were filed alleging mismanagement, fraud, embezzlement, and deliberate deception of the chain's financial state as it collapsed. The Dagwood was sold as a 1.5-pound sandwich. The Dagwood sandwich served in the Dagwood Sandwich Shoppes included the following ingredients: three slices of deli bread, Genoa salami, ham, pepperoni, turkey, cheddar cheese, provolone, lettuce, tomato, roasted red bell peppers, banana peppers, red onion, deli mustard, and low calorie mayonnaise.\nCincinnati-based chain Penn Station East Coast Subs refers to its \"create-it-yourself\" submarine sandwich as a Dagwood.

Some Hot Browns also include ham with the turkey, and either pimentos or tomatoes over the sauce, and imitation Hot Browns sometimes substitute a commercial cheese sauce instead of the Mornay.

A Hot Brown sandwich (sometimes known as a Louisville Hot Brown or Kentucky Hot Brown) is an American hot sandwich originally created at the Brown Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky, by Fred K. Schmidt in 1926. It is a variation of traditional Welsh rarebit and was one of two signature sandwiches created by chefs at the Brown Hotel shortly after its founding in 1923. It was created to serve as an alternative to ham and egg late-night dinners.\nThe \"cold brown\" is baked poultry (chicken or turkey), hard-boiled egg, lettuce, and tomato open-faced on rye bread, and covered with Thousand Island dressing. It is rarely served anymore.\nIn St. Louis, the Prosperity Sandwich is a similar dish, with origins at the Mayfair Hotel in the 1920s. It is still served in the area today, and sometimes called a \"hot brown\".\nThe Turkey Devonshire, first served in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the 1930s, has been described as being similar to the Hot Brown.\nOn the Food Network, the Hot Brown was featured in an episode of Throwdown! with Bobby Flay. Joe and John Castro, chefs of the Brown Hotel in Kentucky, competed and won against Flay in a cook-off. It has also been featured on episodes of the network's shows The Rachael Ray Show and Southern Fried Road Trip. On the Travel Channel, the Hot Brown has been featured on the show Taste of America with Mark DeCarlo, a Louisville-themed episode of Man v. Food Nation and a 2018 episode of Food Paradise titled \"Sandwich Heroes\".\nOn PBS, the Hot Brown has been featured in the documentary Sandwiches That You Will Like as well as the program The Mind of a Chef, where Chef David Chang presented his interpretation of the sandwich.\nCuisine of Kentucky\nHistory of Louisville, Kentucky\nMelt sandwich\nList of American sandwiches\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nList of sandwiches\nKleber, John E.

It receives its name from the cazuela (Spanish for cooking pot) - traditionally, often shallow and of unglazed earthenware - in which it is cooked. The ingredients and preparation vary from region to region, but it is usually a mid-thick flavoured stock obtained from cooking several kinds of meats and vegetables mixed together.",

The cazuela is a typical dish of Chile. The most common types are made of chicken or beef, but there are also other types made from pork, lamb and turkey.\nOne of the most important facts about Chilean cazuela is that it is made by cooking all the ingredients separately and uniting them when serving in the plate. A typical dish of Chilean cazuela is made by boiling the meat (normally beef or chicken) with chopped onions and carrots. All the rest of the ingredients are boiled separate in individual pots, but the stock from the meat is complemented with the stock from the boiling of the vegetables; the plate is served accompanied of a piece of squash or zapallo camote in Spanish, one big potato or a couple of small potatoes, green beans, previously cooked rice and a piece of sweetcorn. Its normally topped with a bit of fresh coriander, parsley or aj\u00ed verde.\nThe cazuela is typically eaten by consuming the liquid stock first, then eating the meat and larger vegetables (e.g. potatoes, large piece of squash or carrot) last. However, the meat and larger vegetables can also be sliced up within the liquid stock and can be eaten simultaneously with the liquid stock. Normally the leftovers are chopped, mixed with green peas and made into another stew called carbonada.\nThe Chilean cazuela  shares roots with a Mapuche stock called \"korr\u00fc\".\nCazuela is a typical dish of the Amazonas region in Peru. The dish is prepared and cooked differently in each province or district of Amazonas.\nIn Chachapoyas, cazuela is prepared by boiling a piece of hen, a good piece of meat and a good piece of sheep. Add some wild cabbage, rice, carrot, sweetcorn grains, and a glass of white wine.\nA few minutes before taking the saucepot out of the fire, add some milk and vermicelli noodles (also called cabello de \u00e1ngel noodles). It is necessary to try that the cazuela has sufficient broth or juice to be able to be served as a soup.\nIn Puerto Rico, cazuela is a traditional crustless pie cooked in banana leaves usually made during the Christmas season. It is similar to a pumpkin pie but uses batata (a type of sweet potato), calabasa (Caribbean squash), raisins, ginger, spices, coconut milk, eggs, butter, and bread, flour or rice flour. There are recipes with added sweet plantain, taro, or yuca with baking powder and lard.\nIn southern Arizona, cazuela (sometimes spelled casuela) is generally made with carne seca or machaca (two varieties of dried beef) with potatoes, garlic, green chiles, and herbs.\nList of soups\nSonia Montecino Aguirre. \"Cocinas mestizas de Chile.

                "description": "Doberge cake is a layered dessert originating in New Orleans, Louisiana, adapted by local baker Beulah Ledner from the Hungarian Dobos torte. Still popular in the area, the cake is made of multiple thin layers of cake alternating with dessert pudding. Very often the cakes are made with half chocolate pudding and half lemon pudding. They are covered in a thin layer of butter cream and a fondant shell or, alternatively, a poured glaze on the outside. They are normally made with six or more layers. Traditional flavors are chocolate, lemon or caramel.",

Beulah Levy Ledner, born into a Jewish family in St. Rose, Louisiana, opened a bakery in New Orleans in 1933. She became very successful after creating her \"Doberge cake\" adapted from the Hungarian/Austrian Dobos Cake, a cake made of nine g\u00e9noise cake layers filled with buttercream and topped with a hard caramel glaze. The doberge cake is based on a recipe originating in Alsace-Lorraine. Ledner replaced the buttercream filling of the Dobos Cake with a custard filling and iced the cakes with buttercream and a thin layer of fondant .\nBeulah Ledner's recipe is available in the cookbook, Let's bake with Beulah Ledner: A legendary New Orleans Lady by Maxine Wolchansky.\nIn 1946 Joe Gambino bought the name, recipe and retail shop, including her recipe for doberge cake and a promise that she would not reopen in New Orleans for five years. After a couple of years of illness, she reopened in a new location on Metairie Road in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie under the name \"Beulah Ledner, Inc.\" As her business and popularity grew, her son, Albert, designed and built a new building and a new machine to mass-produce sheet cakes using his mother's recipes.  She opened her new bakery on May 21, 1970; she ran it until she retired in 1981 the age of 87, when she sold the shop and doberge recipe to Maurice's French Pastries, which is still in the business of baking and selling doberge cakes in Metairie.\nList of cakes\nPrinzregententorte, a similar multi-layered cake\nRigo Jancsi, another famous Hungarian dessert created in the same era\nSmith Island cake, official dessert of the state of Maryland\nSpekkoek, a Dutch layered cake\nGuas, David; Raquel Pelzel (2009).

                "description": "Devil's food cake is a moist, rich chocolate layer cake. It is considered a counterpart to the white or yellow angel food cake. Because of differing recipes and changing ingredient availability over the course of the 20th century, it is difficult to precisely qualify what distinguishes devil's food from the more standard chocolate cake, though it traditionally has more chocolate than a regular chocolate cake, making it darker in colour and with a heavier texture. The cake is usually paired with a rich chocolate frosting. Devil's food cake was invented in the United States in the early twentieth century, with the recipe in print as early as 1905.",

Devil's food cake traditionally uses unsweetened chocolate baking squares in lieu of unsweetened cocoa powder. However, contemporary recipes typically use cocoa powder for its convenience over the more traditional chocolate baking squares. Also, because of its reduced amount of cocoa butter, cocoa powder has a more intense chocolate flavor than unsweetened chocolate. Moreover, coffee is frequently added as a liquid to enhance the chocolate flavor. Some recipes use hot or boiling water as the cake's main liquid, rather than milk. Its antithetical counterpart, the angel food cake, is a very light white cake that uses stiffly beaten egg whites and no dairy.\nDevil's food cake is sometimes distinguished from other chocolate cakes by the use of additional baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), which raises the pH level and makes the cake a deeper and darker mahogany color. Devil's food cake incorporates butter (or a substitute), flour, and less egg than other chocolate cakes.\nAngel food cake\nList of desserts\nMississippi mud pie\nRed velvet cake\nJudith M.

During the plague epidemic in 1643, the aldermen of Lyon made the vow to organize a procession at Fourvi\u00e8re to implore the Virgin Mary to save the city. They carried a 7-pound (3.2\u00a0kg) wax candle and a gold crown on a silk cushion. This gave the chocolatier Voisin, based in Lyon since 1897, the idea of using the shape of the cushion to create this confection in 1960. It has become the most popular French specialty confection containing chocolate ganache.\nThis delicacy has become very popular. It is possible to buy the \"cushions\" individually, and also in velvet boxes which recall the original form of silk cushion.\nThe Boucaud family has a monopoly in marketing the coussins, which it makes in its network of retail stores across the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region and in Marseille. In 2010 company manager, Paul Boucaud, said that Voisin manufactures annually 85 tonnes (94 tons) of coussins in Lyon and that production increases by 10% year on year. The family does not use large retailers to market its product.\nLyonnaise cuisine\nList of pastries\n\"Le Coussin de Lyon\". Cuisine Lyonnaise. 13 April 2007.

Kifli, kiflice, kifle or kipferl is a traditional yeast bread roll that is rolled and formed into a crescent before baking.\nIt is a common type of bread roll throughout much of central Europe and nearby countries, where it is called by different names. It is thought to be the inspiration for the French croissant, which has a very similar shape but is made with a different type of dough.\nThe breadstuff or pastry is called:\nkifli in Hungarian\nkipfl in Austrian Italy\nKipferl in Austrian German\nk\u00fcpfel or a Meidlinger roll in Vienna\nH\u00f6rnchen (little horn) in German\nkifla or \u043a\u0438\u0444\u043b\u0430 (pl. kifle or kiflice) in Croatian, Bosnian, and Serbian\n\u043a\u0438\u0444\u043b\u0430 or kifla in Bulgarian\n\u043a\u0438\u0444\u043b\u0430 in Macedonian\nkifle in Albanian\ngiffel in Danish and Swedish\nrogal or rogalik (little horn) in Polish\nrohl\u00edk in  Czech\nro\u017eok in Slovak\n\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a/rogalik in Russian\n\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a/rohalyk in Ukrainian\nroglji\u010dek or kifelc in Slovene\ncornule\u021b in Romanian\ngipfel in Switzerland\nIn Old Polish, rogal meant \"horns/horned\", and in Old High German, Kipfa meant \"carriage stanchion\" and referred to the stanchions or \"horns\" of a cart. In the 13th century, that usage referred to a bread shape of pagan origin.\nKifli are a traditional Hungarian yeasted bread rolled into a crescent shape. The Austrian Kipferl is a small wheat roll with pointed ends. The 17th-century Austrian monk Abraham a Sancta Clara described the roll as crescent shaped, writing \"the moon in the first quarter shines like a kipfl\", and noted there were kifli in various forms: \"vil lange, kurze, krumpe und gerade kipfel\" (\"many long, short, crooked and straight kipfel\"). \nBreads or pastries in the shape of a crescent moon are believed to have been served in ancient times as offerings to the goddess of the moon, Selene. The shape is also reminiscent of horns; both are associated with ancient symbolism and considered the oldest surviving pastry shape. A moon shaped pastry creates itself naturally by hand-rolling a ball of dough into a cylinder form.\nA list of foods eaten in a 10th-century convent include panis lunatis, described as a small crescent-shaped roll often eaten during fasts.\nThe kifli has been documented in Austria to at least 1227 when they were recorded in Babenberg-ruled Vienna as chipfen:\nd\u00f4 br\u00e2chten im die pecken\nchipfen und wei\u0292e flecken,\n\nwei\u0292er dann ein hermelein.\n\u2014\u2009Jans der Enikel\nIn Austria the kifli (nowadays called Kipferl) is formally recognized by the government as a traditional food. According to the Austrian Ministry of Sustainability and Tourism, kifli were probably a traditional monastery pastry baked for Easter. They are described as crescent-shaped rolls made of yeast wheat dough in a variety of shapes and as being popular for coffee breaks and breakfasts, particularly in Vienna.\nThe kifli likely inspired the similarly-shaped French croissant, which is made from a laminated pastry dough.\nA common culinary myth claims that when Christian forces freed Buda from Ottoman occupation in 1686 the bakers of the town celebrated the victory the next day by selling freshly baked bread rolls made into a crescent shape. Another story claims the Kipferl was invented in Vienna after or during the siege of the city by Ottoman Turks.\n\nWhen they come out of the oven, the rolls can be left plain or brushed with water to make them shiny. They can be given an egg wash and sprinkled with either poppy seeds or caraway seeds mixed with coarse salt. The latter variety is often made into a straight shape rather than a crescent. Kifli is eaten like bread or rolls; it is usually made into a sandwich, sometimes plain or with butter like a fresh baguette. Often, especially for breakfast, the topping is jam or honey. They may also be used for dunking.\nThis is the same as the regular style but the dough may contain butter or other shortening and milk. It is sweeter than the regular variety and is well-suited to be eaten with jam or honey, and is commonly eaten for breakfast with coffee, hot chocolate or milk. It might also be an accompaniment for drinks like Doogh and Kumis.\nThere are a couple of sweet rolls named \"kifli\" to describe their shape; they are eaten at the end of a meal or with an afternoon drink; these are not kifli, which when used on its own, always means the regular or fine varieties. In German, these are differentiated with a different spelling: Kipferl compared to Kipfel for the yeast bread.\nVanillekipferl is a small, very short soft cookie made from a dough of ground nuts instead of flour. It is originally made with walnuts but almonds are more often used outside of Hungary. Once baked they are rolled in vanilla-flavored confectioners' sugar then allowed to",

Palak paneer ([pa\u02d0l\u0259k p\u0259ni\u02d0\u027e]) is a vegetarian dish, consisting of paneer (a type of cottage cheese) in a thick paste made from pur\u00e9ed spinach, called palak in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and other Indian languages.\nThe terms palak paneer and saag paneer are sometimes used interchangeably in restaurants in the United States and Canada. However, saag paneer is different from traditional palak paneer in that it contains other green leafy vegetables, such as mustard greens, whereas palak paneer only contains spinach. Dhaba restaurants often specialize in palak paneer.\nPalak paneer is served hot with a side such as roti, naan, paranthas, makki di roti, or boiled rice. It can also be served with onions on the side for a more traditional approach.\nIn recent years, there have been fusion variations of palak paneer. In July 2020, a Bangalore-based food blogger posted her variation of palak paneer idli. The dish sparked conversation on Twitter and Instagram about the unusual combination of these two North and South Indian dishes. In September 2020, Vietnam-based Pizza 4P's created unique fusion pizzas in honor of the International Day of Peace. One of these variations was a palak paneer-chapli kebab pizza to symbolize peace between India and Pakistan.\nSaag paneer\nSarson ka saag\n\u00a0Food portal\nPastime, Palatable. \"PALAK PANEER (INDIAN FRESH SPINACH WITH PANEER CHEESE)\".\n\"spinach - Meaning in hindi - Shabdkosh\". www.shabdkosh.com.

Palak paneer ([pa\u02d0l\u0259k p\u0259ni\u02d0\u027e]) is a vegetarian dish, consisting of paneer (a type of cottage cheese) in a thick paste made from pur\u00e9ed spinach, called palak in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and other Indian languages.\nThe terms palak paneer and saag paneer are sometimes used interchangeably in restaurants in the United States and Canada. However, saag paneer is different from traditional palak paneer in that it contains other green leafy vegetables, such as mustard greens, whereas palak paneer only contains spinach. Dhaba restaurants often specialize in palak paneer.\nPalak paneer is served hot with a side such as roti, naan, paranthas, makki di roti, or boiled rice. It can also be served with onions on the side for a more traditional approach.\nIn recent years, there have been fusion variations of palak paneer. In July 2020, a Bangalore-based food blogger posted her variation of palak paneer idli. The dish sparked conversation on Twitter and Instagram about the unusual combination of these two North and South Indian dishes. In September 2020, Vietnam-based Pizza 4P's created unique fusion pizzas in honor of the International Day of Peace. One of these variations was a palak paneer-chapli kebab pizza to symbolize peace between India and Pakistan.\nSaag paneer\nSarson ka saag\n\u00a0Food portal\nPastime, Palatable. \"PALAK PANEER (INDIAN FRESH SPINACH WITH PANEER CHEESE)\".\n\"spinach - Meaning in hindi - Shabdkosh\". www.shabdkosh.com.

Pashman decided to end it with -elli to sound like more traditional Italian pasta names that often end with the masculine plural diminutive suffixes -ini, -elli, -illi, -etti to convey the sense of \"little.\"\nDan Pashman, host of the \"Sporkful\" podcast, decided to make a new \"ideal\" pasta shape that needed to have the perfect bite, an appealing texture, and hold the right amount of sauce. The American pasta company, Sfoglini, partnered with Pashman to make this pasta come true.\nPashman coined terms to describe the three qualities to talk about pasta shapes:\n\"Forkability\" - how easy it is to get a pasta shape on your fork and keep it there\n\"Sauceability\" - how well a sauce sticks to it\n\"Toothsinkability\" - how satisfying it is to sink your teeth into\nThe pasta was officially released in 2021, after a three-year research and development process. That process is documented in The Sporkful podcast series \"Mission: ImPASTAble.\"\nCascatelli are a half-tubed pasta made of hard durum wheat flour and water, or semolina. The suggested cook time is 13-17 minutes.\nSfoglini's self-claimed perfect rag\u00f9 companion for cascatelli is pancetta and red pepper flakes, similar to the classic Roman sauce amatriciana, with ground pork, onion, carrots, and celery which make it more Bolognese.\nThis is similar to the parent pasta, bucatini, which in Italian cuisine is commonly served with amatriciana sauce.\nBucatini\nMafaldine\nList of pasta\n\"For Pasta Lovers Bored By Spaghetti, There's A New Short, Wavy, Sauce-Holding Shape\".

                "description": "Chipa ([ti.pa], [ipa]) is a type of small, baked, cheese-flavored rolls, a popular snack and breakfast food in Paraguay. The recipe has existed since the 18th century and its origins lie with the indigenous Guaran people. It is inexpensive and often sold from streetside stands and on buses by vendors carrying a large basket with the warm chipa wrapped in a cloth. The original name is from Guarani chipa. A small chipa may be called a chipita. In Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, the term cuap (Guarani) is often used. In some parts of Argentina, it is called chip (with an accent mark), or chipacito when it is small.",

Chipa has been prepared in the Guarani region (Paraguay, Northeastern Argentina, Southeastern Bolivia and Southwestern Brazil) since humans settled in the area. During inception, the Guarani people prepared it only with cassava starch and water. After the arrival of the colonists and Jesuit missionaries, and with the introduction of cattle, chickens  and new products derived from this livestock (like cheese and eggs), chipa began to gradually evolve into the widely used recipe of the early 21st century.\nIn the Guaran\u00ed region, chipa is often baked in smaller doughnuts or buns that may be called chipa'\u00ed or chipacitos. These are sold in small bags by street sellers of big cities and small towns. In the preparation of chipa yeast is not used, so in spite of the high temperatures of the region it can be preserved for many days. It is a festive food and can be found in every popular religious celebration.\nOther common variants in Paraguay include the chipa cabur\u00e9 or chip\u00e1 mboc\u00e1 (cooked around a stick, in consequence it doesn't have the spongy inner center) and the chipa so'o, filled with ground meat. There are other varieties of chipa with different ingredients; chipa manduvi (made with a mix of corn flour and peanut), chipa avat\u00ed and chipa rora (made of the skin of the seed of corn after being strained, like a whole-wheat bread).\nCheese bun\nP\u00e3o de queijo\nMbeju\nAlmoj\u00e1bana\nPandebono\nPan de queso\nPan de yuca\nElichondo, Margarita: La comida criolla: Memoria y recetas.

The exact product to which the word bizcocho is applied varies widely depending on the region and country. For instance, in Spain bizcocho is exclusively used to refer to sponge cake. In Uruguay, most buttery flaky pastry including croissants are termed bizcocho, whilst sponge cake is called bizcochuelo. In Chile, the Dominican Republic and Bolivia bizcocho refers to a sweet dough (masa) baked with local ingredients, similar to the bizcocho from Spain. In Ecuador the dough of a bizcocho can either be sweet or salty. ...",

Some of the most usual types of bizcochos are:\nBizcochito: A cookie flavored with anise and cinnamon developed in the Spanish colonial province of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico, roughly corresponding to the US state New Mexico in the present day.\nBizcocho de soletilla: is the name given in Spain to ladyfinger  biscuits.\nCroasanes [k\u027eoa\u02c8sanes] or Croissants: Croissants are called bizcocho in Uruguay. Sweet croasanes can be filled with chocolate, pastry cream, dulce de membrillo (a sweet quince paste), or dulce de leche, savoury with cheese, ham or salami.\nGalletas dulces [\u0261a\u02c8\u028eetaz \u02c8\u00f0ul\u03b8es] or [\u0261a\u02c8\u029detaz \u02c8\u00f0ulses], a descendant of the pastry known as galleta, galleta de campa\u00f1a or galleta con grasa. Galletas dulces have a layer of caramel and sugar on top and are known as bizcochos in Uruguay\nMargaritas: They are a variation of croissants found both in Uruguay and Argentina.  The ends are joined together, leaving some space in the middle for a sweet filling (pastry cream, dulce de membrillo or dulce de leche). They have sugar on top of the pastry and the filling. Margaritas get their name from the flower they resemble (a daisy, known in Spanish as \"margarita\").\nOjitos [o\u02c8xitos]: A kind of round cookie with a space in the middle filled with dulce de membrillo, also from Uruguay.\nPan con grasa, another kind of bizcocho found in Uruguay, is a type of bread, also known as the ca\u00f1\u00f3n.\nPolvorones [pol\u03b2o\u02c8\u027eones]: Another kind of cookie that can be plain, flavoured with cocoa, or made with half plain dough and half cocoa flavoured. Polvorones originated in Spain.\nSponge Cake: sponge cake is called bizcocho in Spain. It may be  made with chocolate, lemon, yoghurt, etc.\nVigilantes [bixi\u02c8lantes]: Another sweet variation of croissants. They are long and thin, with sugar on top.\n\nIn Costa Rica, bizcochos are made with masa, spices, and/or cheese. They are eaten as a snack, especially during coffee breaks.\nIn Mexico, bizcocho is commonly used as a synonym for pan dulce. It can also be used as a flirtatious compliment to a good looking woman or, less commonly, a handsome man (\"Goodbye, bizcocho!\"). In some parts, however, it is a very vulgar term, referring to a person's genitals (mainly female) and not used in polite company.\nIn the Philippines, biscocho (also spelled biskotso) refers to class of breads (usually stale) that is baked again into a crunchy pastry.\nBizcochos are one of the most intrinsic traditions of the Uruguayan culture. They are the inseparable \"companions\" of mate, coffee, caf\u00e9 con leche, or tea for breakfast or the merienda (afternoon tea). They are also common in meetings with friends, especially those taking place in parks, squares, beaches or along the coastline in ramblas (an avenue bordering the coast with pedestrian areas on each side) such as the ones in Montevideo.\nBizcochos are sold not only at panader\u00edas (bakeries), but also at specialized shops called bizcocher\u00edas.\nAny type of cake, unless otherwise having a specific name (example: tres leches), is termed a bizcocho.\nList of cakes\nList of cookies\nList of pastries\nNocheseda, Elmer. \"Biscocho\".

Krupuk rambak or krupuk made from cow or buffalo skin, is the oldest-mentioned krupuk variant in ancient Java. According to a culinary historian, krupuk has been around in Java since the 9th or 10th century, written on the Batu Pura inscription as krupuk rambak, and still exists today in Javanese cuisine and are usually used in krechek dish.\nKrupuk kulit is often served as a crispy snack to accompany main meals. In Padang restaurants they are often offered as a side dish for nasi padang or sate padang, and often served with kuah gulai seasoning. In Java, krupuk kulit is the essential ingredients for krechek, a krupuk kulit dish in spicy coconut milk stew.\nMost of krupuk kulit sold in Indonesia are made from cattle skin, ether cow or water buffalo (kerbau). However, in some areas with large non-Muslim populations such as Bali, Batak lands, and some Chinatowns in Medan and other cities, pork skin krupuk kulit is also available. Compared to common cow skin crackers, kerupuk kulit babi (pork rinds) have a lighter colour and crumble more easily.

The dough (masa) is identical to that of a wheat flour tortilla. It is cooked on a comal with a hot piece of metal placed on top that resembles a clothes iron. The gordita fills with steam, and a small slit is cut into one side where it can be filled with guisados.\nThe Salvadoran dish pupusa is similar to a gordita, except completely sealed and typically served with curtido, a lightly pickled cabbage relish.\nIn Venezuela and Colombia an arepa (a type of cornbread) is often served stuffed with various ingredients. It is prepared in a similar way as a Mexican gordita, except the final dish is smaller and slimmer.\nIn China the Roujiamo is a similar dish that means 'meat sandwiched in bread', is a street food originating from the cuisine of Shaanxi Province and widely consumed all over China.\nThe fast food restaurant chain Taco Bell offers a wheat flour gordita that has limited similarity to gorditas as served in Mexico and is more akin to a pita bread taco.\nIn eastern and central Mexico \"gorditas de nata\" (cream gorditas) are consumed often as a breakfast dish or snack. It is a sweet cake similar to a tiny but extremely thick pancake made with milk cream or clotted cream, called nata in Mexico, cinnamon, sugar, and white wheat flour. They are named \"gordita\" too, due to their appearance, similar to the original fried gordita, but their taste is sweet, not salty. Besides their appearance, this snack is not related to the original one. The same flour preparation used to prepare gorditas de nata is also used to cook a flat cookie variation, which by extension it is also called \"gordita\", but in contrast, it is thin and crispy, not thick. To differentiate them, these flat cookies are called \"sugar gorditas\" instead.\nArepa\u00a0\u2013 Typical food from Colombia and Venezuela\nPupusa\u00a0\u2013 Salvadoran food\nAntojito\nList of Mexican dishes\u00a0\u2013 Wikipedia list article\nList of stuffed dishes\u00a0\u2013 Wikipedia list article\n\u00a0food portal\nRick Bayless, JeanMarie Brownson & Deann Groen Bayless (2000).

                "description": "Garudiya or Garudhiya () is a clear fish broth. It is one of the basic and traditional food items of Maldivian cuisine. The broth is based on tuna species found in the nation's ocean waters such as skipjack (kanumas or goa), yellowfin tuna (kanneli), little tunny (lai), or frigate tuna) (raagoni). Despite the introduction of new items in the Maldivian cuisine, garudiya is still a Maldivian favourite as it has been for generations.",

In order to cook garudiya, tuna fish are cut up following a traditional pattern. After having had the gills and some of the innards thrown away, the fish pieces, the heads and the bones are carefully washed. The fish is then boiled in water with salt, until it is well cooked. The foam or scum (filleyo) is carefully removed while boiling and is later discarded.\nGarudiya is usually eaten with steamed rice, but it can also be eaten with roshi, the Maldivian chapati. When eaten with steamed taro (Alocasia and Colocasia), or with steamed breadfruit, grated coconut is added.\nSometimes  Maldivians use chilies, curry leaves and onions to flavor the garudiya according to their taste, however, mostly this broth is cooked simply using fish, salt and water.\nKekki garudiya is a variant of garudiya with spices.\nGarudiya could be also obtained using other fishes like wahoo (kurumas), mahi-mahi (fiyala) or bluefin jack (handi), among others, but the favored fish for garudiya is tuna and related species.\nWhen the tuna-based garudiya is cooked until all the water evaporates, it forms a thick brown paste known as Rihaakuru that is highly valued in the Maldivian diet.\nMaldive fish\nList of tuna dishes\nXavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom, Barcelona 1999, ISBN\u00a084-7254-801-5\nEating on the Islands - As times have changed, so has the Maldives' unique cuisine and culture\nMIFCO; Rihaakuru Archived 2013-06-04 at the Wayback Machine",

                "description": "Neyyappam (Malayalam: ) is a sweet rice-based fritter fried in ghee. Neyyappam has its origins in the southern Indian state of Kerala and coastal Karnataka. The name is derived from the words neyy () meaning \"ghee\" (clarified butter) and appam () meaning \"pancake\". Neyyappam is typically made of rice flour (alternatively, with rava or semolina), jaggery, ghee-fried coconut (pieces or grated), ghee, cardamom and milk. It is served as a tea time snack usually in the evenings. Neyyappam is also served as offering in Hindu temples in Kerala.

Recipes vary from place to place, especially the ingredients chosen to prepare the batter.\nMany cuisines use variations on this pan for similar dishes. A substitute for an appakara is the special pan used to prepare \u00c6bleskiver, the Danish puffy ball-like pancake dessert.\nIn the absence of these special utensils, neyyappam may be cooked on a griddle or a small cooking pan (skillet).\nRinse the white rice in water and keep it soaked for 3\u20134 hours.\nSkip this step if using rice flour or rava/semolina.\nDrain the water and grind the rice (using a mixer-grinder) with ripe banana and jaggery to form a thick paste.\nFry dry coconut slices (or grated coconut) in ghee until golden-brown.\nAdd the ghee-fried coconut, cardamom seeds and cumin seeds.

It is a well-known breakfast food in the states on the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia (Terengganu, Kelantan, parts of Pahang and eastern Johor), southern Thai Malay provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat and across the Indonesian border in Natuna and Anambas, Riau Islands. The most famous nasi dagang comes from Kampung Ladang in Terengganu and Tumpat in Kelantan.",

The rice may first be soaked in water for several hours to soften it. It is then mixed with thick coconut milk, sliced shallots, lemongrass and fenugreek seeds. The rice is steamed until cooked. It may also be steamed twice, where more coconut milk is added when it is half-cooked. Then the rice is steamed again until cooked. This method ensures a more creamy finish to the rice.\nThis accompanying dish is only specially prepared for nasi dagang and is sometimes locally called gulai darat.\nThis curry the fish is cooked in is not an Indian-style curry powder but a Malay-style curry, i.e., coconut milk mixed with traditional Malay spices such as lemon grass, galangal, chilli paste, and turmeric.\nTuna is the standard choice of fish but other fish can be used as well, such as tenggiri. Chicken and prawns are also used sometimes; however, the gulai darat is prepared slightly differently.\nKelapa Parut is freshly shaved, mixed with sliced shallots and fried until golden brown.\nHard boiled eggs are cut into four or eight slices.\nThe vegetable is pickled in rice vinegar and sugar. The vegetables commonly used are cucumber, chilli and carrots.\nChilli sambal can sometimes be included.\nTelur pindang, herb-boiled eggs, commonly paired with Nasi dagang among the Malay community in Thailand (Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani).\nSmoked fish cooked with spicy and creamy gravy, a side dish usually being accompanied with Nasi Dagang in Natuna and Anambas Islands, Indonesia.\nThe Terengganu version uses the normal white rice, while the Kelantanese variety uses a type of rice locally called 'beras nasi dagang', which is a type of wild rice that has a light purple colour and a little glutinous. The Terengganuan version is also much simpler, eaten only with the fish curry (sometimes with belimbing buluh added) and pickles.\nOutside the Malaysian border, it is a staple breakfast in the deep south of Thailand (Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat), the nasi dagang of southern Thailand features both Kelantanese (red) and Terengganuan (white) version of the dish. While across the South China Sea, the Nasi dagang in Natuna & Anambas attributed a similar gurai (gravy) with the Terangganese version of the rice, although the rice for the Natuna-Anambas version of Nasi Dagang was cooked with coconut milk, closely related to Nasi Lemak.\nList of rice dishes\nNasi kerabu\nNasi lemak\n\"Nasi Dagang\" (in Malay).

The high oil and egg content create a very moist cake, and as oil is liquid even at cooler temperatures, chiffon cakes do not tend to harden or dry out as traditional butter cakes might. This makes them better-suited than many cakes to filling or frosting with ingredients that need to be refrigerated or frozen, such as pastry cream or ice cream. The lack of butter, however, means that chiffon cakes lack much of the rich flavor of butter cakes.\nThe recipe is credited to Harry Baker (1883\u20131974), a Californian insurance salesman turned caterer. Baker kept the recipe secret for 20 years until he sold it to General Mills, which spread the recipe through marketing materials in the 1940s and 1950s under the name \"chiffon cake\", and a set of 14 recipes and variations was released to the public in a Betty Crocker pamphlet published in 1948.\nIn the United States, March 29 is National Lemon Chiffon Cake Day.\nJapanese cheesecake\nPaper wrapped cake\nList of lemon dishes and beverages\nMalgieri, Nick. \"CAKES: RECIPES AND TIPS\".

Arrosticini (rustelle or arrustelle in the local dialects; also known as spiedini or spiducci) are typically made from castrated sheep meat, or lamb, cut in chunks and pierced by a skewer. It is cooked on a brazier with a typically elongated shape, called furnacella as it resembles a gutter. There are two main kinds of arrosticini: those made industrially, consisting of cubical chunks of meat with a side of 1cm (1/2.5inches) on skewers with a maximum length of 10cm (4inches); and those made by hand, for which the meat is cut with a knife in chunks of different sizes, alternated on the skewer with pieces of ovine fat. ...",

Like the Indonesian version, it primarily uses turmeric, but also adds lemongrass and does not use coconut milk.

In Indonesian culture, nasi kuning has favourable symbolic meanings. The yellow-coloured rice is perceived to look like a pile of gold, so it is often served in festive occasions; including parties, housewarmings, welcoming guests and opening ceremonies \u2013 as a symbol of good fortune, prosperity, wealth and dignity.\nNasi kuning is quite widespread and commonly found in Indonesian culture. It can be found from Java to Sumatra, Bali and Sulawesi. However, it is most strongly associated with Javanese and Minahasa traditions. In Java, nasi kuning might come in the form of a cone called a tumpeng and is usually eaten during special events. The top of the tumpeng is customarily given to the most senior person in attendance. One of the most popular nasi kuning variants comes from Manado in North Sulawesi, which employs cakalang (skipjack tuna).\nThe addition of turmeric and coconut milk, sometimes also includes pandan and lemongrass during the rice cooking and steaming process, has contributed to a tempting colour, pleasant fragrance, soft texture and a flavourful taste of the yellow rice. Certain spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and bay leaves, might be added to enhance this aromatic fragrant rice dish.\nNasi kuning is usually served with a variety of side dishes such as shredded omelette, serundeng (relish of grated coconut and spices), urap (vegetable in shredded coconut dressing), teri kacang (fried anchovy and peanuts), sambal goreng (fried tempeh and potato caramelised in spicy sauce), ayam goreng (Javanese-style fried chicken), balado udang (shrimp in chilli), or perkedel (potato fritters). More elaborate nasi kuning might include fried cow's brain, fried cow's lung, beef and seafood. It is common to serve nasi kuning with kerupuk udang (shrimp cracker) or emping chips and a decoratively cut cucumber and tomato.\nList of rice dishes\nNasi bogana\nNasi campur\nNasi goreng\nNasi kucing\nNasi lemak\nNasi liwet\nNasi pecel\nNasi tim\nNasi uduk\nNasi ulam\nSalloum, Habeeb (14 December 2003). \"Recipe: Nasi Kuning \u2013 Indonesian Yellow Rice | ThingsAsian\". thingsasian.com.

Originally conceived of as a coal miner's lunch, it is popular in West Virginia and some nearby regions of the Appalachian Mountains such as Western Pennsylvania, Western Maryland, and Appalachian Ohio. In West Virginia it is nearly ubiquitous, particularly in convenience stores, and is arguably the food most closely associated with the state. Pepperoni rolls are also found in Southeast Michigan where they were popular among auto workers in the factories. The classic pepperoni roll consists of a fairly soft white yeast-leavened bread roll with pepperoni baked in the middle. ...",

The pepperoni roll was first sold by Giuseppe \"Joseph\" Argiro at the Country Club Bakery in Fairmont, West Virginia, in 1927.\nThe rolls originated as a lunch option for the coal miners of north-central West Virginia in the first half of the 20th century. Pepperoni rolls do not need to be refrigerated for storage and could readily be packed for lunch by miners.  Pepperoni and other Italian foods became popular in north-central West Virginia in the early 20th century, when the booming mines and railroads attracted many immigrants from Italy.  The pepperoni roll bears a resemblance to the pasty and sausage roll, which originated in the mining communities of Great Britain, as well as the Italian calzone.\nVariations on the original pepperoni roll may contain different types of cheese, peppers, or other ingredients.  The pepperoni within can take several forms, including a single stick, several folded slices, or shredded or ground meat.\nPepperoni rolls faced a legal challenge in 1987 when the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposed reclassifying bakeries that manufactured the rolls as meat processing plants, thus subjecting them to stricter regulations. The bakery owners said, however, that the costs of meeting the new regulations would put them out of business. The USDA's proposal was quashed after Jay Rockefeller, U.S. Senator for West Virginia, intervened.\nIn the early 2000s, the U.S. military began including a version of the pepperoni roll in one of the MREs (Meals, Ready-to-Eat) provided to troops. In the late 2000s, the U.S. Army changed the pepperoni roll to its First Strike Ration. These rations are designed for light infantry, airborne, and special forces during a typical 72-hour patrol. The pepperoni roll's compact size and comparatively high nutritional return make it an ideal ration for these patrols. These rations were extensively employed during Operation Enduring Freedom. The military's rolls are made by a North Carolina company.\nList of stuffed dishes\nSausage bread\nStromboli\n\"House passes bill declaring Pepperoni Roll official food of West Virginia\".

                "description": "Scrapple, also known by the Pennsylvania Dutch name Pannhaas (\"pan hare\" in English), is traditionally a mush of pork scraps and trimmings combined with cornmeal and wheat flour, often buckwheat flour, and spices. The mush is formed into a semi-solid congealed loaf, and slices of the scrapple are then pan-fried before serving. Scraps of meat left over from butchering, not used or sold elsewhere, were made into scrapple to avoid waste. Scrapple is best known as an American food of the southern Mid-Atlantic states (Delaware, Maryland, South Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia). Scrapple and panhaas are commonly considered an ethnic food of the Pennsylvania Dutch, including the Mennonites and Amish. ...",

Scrapple is typically made of hog offal, such as the head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to the pot and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning are very much a matter of the region and the cook's taste.\nA few manufacturers have introduced beef and turkey varieties and color the loaf to retain the traditional coloration derived from the original pork liver base.\nDue to its composition, it is often jokingly described as being made from \"everything but the oink\".\nScrapple is typically cut into 1\u20444-to-3\u20444-inch-thick (0.6 to 1.9\u00a0cm) slices and pan-fried until brown to form a crust. It is sometimes first coated with flour. It may be fried in butter or oil and is sometimes deep-fried.  Scrapple can also be broiled, which gives the scrapple a crisp exterior.\nScrapple is usually eaten as a breakfast side dish. It can be served plain or with either sweet or savory condiments: apple butter, ketchup, jelly, maple syrup, honey, or mustard.\nEtymologically, \"scrapple\" is a diminutive of \"scrap\", a reference to its composition.\nThe roots of the culinary traditions that led to the development of scrapple in America have been traced back to pre-Roman Europe. The more immediate culinary ancestor of scrapple was the Low German dish called panhas, which was adapted to make use of locally available ingredients, and it is still called \"Pannhaas,\" \"panhoss,\" \"ponhoss,\" or \"pannhas\" in parts of Pennsylvania. The first recipes were created by German colonists who settled near Philadelphia and Chester County, Pennsylvania in the 17th and 18th centuries. As a result, scrapple is strongly associated with areas surrounding Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Washington, D.C.; Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Southern New York, and the Delmarva Peninsula. Its popularity on the Delmarva Peninsula is celebrated the second weekend of October during the annual \"Apple Scrapple Festival\" in Bridgeville, Delaware.\nThe two largest brands of scrapple in Philadelphia are Habbersett and Rapa, controlling approximately half and one-quarter of the market respectively.  Rapa accounts for about three-quarters of the Baltimore market.\nThe title of jazz artist Charlie Parker's 1947 composition \"Scrapple from the Apple\" is inspired by the food scrapple, in the Big Apple (New York City).\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nFoods\nBalkenbrij, a traditional Dutch food that shares some of the characteristics of scrapple\nFaggot, an English dish made of meat off-cuts and offal, especially pork\nGoetta, a meat-and-grain sausage or mush of German inspiration, popular near Cincinnati\nGroaty pudding, in England, made from soaked groats, beef, leeks, onion and beef stock which is then baked\nHaggis, a traditional Scottish savory pudding containing sheep's pluck (heart, liver, and lungs), minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock\nH\u00e1karl, a national dish of Iceland consisting of a Greenland shark or other sleeper shark which has been cured with a particular fermentation process and hung to dry for four to five months\nHaslet, in England, a pork meatloaf with herbs\nHead cheese, a dish made from meat scraps traditionally (though not exclusively) derived from an animal's head\nLivermush, in the United States, a dish of pig liver, head parts, and cornmeal\nLorne sausage, a traditional Scottish food usually made from minced meat, rusk and spices\nMeatloaf, a dish of ground meat mixed with other ingredients and formed into a loaf shape, then baked or smoked\nPork roll, pork-based processed meat available in parts of the northeastern United States\nSlatur, an Icelandic food made from the innards of sheep\nWeckewerk, in Germany, a sausage made from cooked brawn and minced meat, veal or sausage, and broth of pork, sometimes from cooked meat, blood and offal\nPennsylvania Folklife 22.

                "description": "Candy corn is a type of small, pyramid-shaped candy, typically divided into three sections of different colors, with a waxy texture and a flavor based on honey, sugar, butter, and vanilla. It is a staple candy of the fall season and the Halloween holiday in North America. Candy corn's traditional colors of yellow, orange, and white represent the colors of the fall harvest, or of corn on the cob, with the wide yellow end resembling a corn kernel. Candy corn has a reputation for polarizing responses, with articles referring to it as \"Halloween's most contentious sweet\" that people either \"love\" or \"hate.\"",

It was first invented in the 1880s by a Wunderle Candy Company employee, George Renninger. Wunderle Candy Company was the first to produce the candy in 1888. Following the Wunderle Candy Company, the Goelitz Confectionery Company (now called Jelly Belly) began manufacturing the product in 1898. While Jelly Belly still makes candy corn, the largest manufacturer of candy corn is Brach's Confections owned by the Ferrara Candy Company. Brach's makes approximately 7 billion pieces of candy corn per year and possesses 85 percent of the total share of the candy corn industry during the Halloween season. \nAlong with other agriculture-inspired treats at the time in the late 19th century, America's confectioners sought to market candy corn to a largely rural society. During the late 1800s, \"butter cream\" candies molded into many types of nature inspired shapes, including chestnuts, turnips, and clover leaves were quite popular but what made candy corn stand out was its bright and iconic tri-color layering.\nAlthough it is currently most popular in the fall, candy corn was not always associated with the fall and Halloween season. For the first half of the 20th century, candy corn was a well known \"penny candy\" or bulk confectionery, and it was advertised as an affordable and popular treat that could be eaten year round. \nCandy corn developed into a fall and Halloween staple around the 1950s when people began to hand out individually wrapped candy to trick-or-treaters. The harvest-themed colors and increased advertising in the month of October also helped candy corn become a fall staple.\nThe National Confectioners Association has deemed October 30, the day before Halloween, as \"National Candy Corn Day.\"\nThe National Confectioners Association estimates that around 35 million pounds (over 15,000 metric tons) of candy corn are sold annually. As of 2016, annual production in the United States was 35 million pounds, or almost 9 billion pieces of candy. The majority of candy corn sales occur during the Halloween season.\nOriginally the candy was made by hand. Manufacturers first combined sugar, corn syrup, carnauba wax, and water and cooked them to form a slurry. Fondant was added for texture and marshmallows were added to provide a soft bite. The final mixture was then heated and poured into shaped molds. Three passes, one for each colored section, were required during the pouring process.\nThe recipe remains basically the same today. The production method, called \"corn starch modeling,\" likewise remains  the same, though tasks initially performed by hand were soon taken over by machines made for that purpose.\nA popular variation called \"harvest corn\" adds cocoa powder and features a chocolate brown wide end, orange center and pointed white tip, often available around Thanksgiving. During the Halloween season, blackberry cobbler candy corn can be found in Eastern Canada, as well as candy corn shaped like pumpkins. Confectioners have introduced additional color variations suited to other holidays. The Christmas variant (sometimes called \"reindeer corn\") typically has a red end and a green center; the Valentine's Day variant (sometimes called \"cupid corn\") typically has a red end and a pink center; In the United States during Independence Day celebrations, corn with a blue end, white center, and red tip (named \"freedom corn\") can be found at celebratory cook outs and patriotic celebrations; the Easter variant (sometimes called \"bunny corn\") is typically only a two-color candy, and comes with a variety of pastel bases (pink, green, yellow, and purple) with white tips all in one package. There have also been caramel apple and green apple, s'mores and pumpkin spice, carrot corn (green and orange, with a carrot cake flavor) and birthday cake candy corn flavors.\nCandy corn flavored snacks have become more widely available with candy corn flavored variants of snack foods and candy such as Oreos, M&M's, marshmallows, and more.\nCandy pumpkin\nFruitcake\nPai, Tanya (2015-10-29). \"Candy corn: Halloween's most contentious sweet, explained\".

In many English-speaking countries outside North America, including the United Kingdom, the most common word for a crisp cookie is biscuit. The term cookie is normally used to describe chewier ones. However, in many regions both terms are used. The container used to store cookies may be called a cookie jar.\nIn Scotland the term cookie is sometimes used to describe a plain bun.\nCookies that are baked as a solid layer on a sheet pan and then cut, rather than being baked as individual pieces, are called in British English bar cookies or traybakes.\nThe word dates from at least 1701 in Scottish usage where the word meant \"plain bun\", rather than thin baked good, and so it is not certain whether it is the same word. From 1808, the word \"cookie\" is attested \"...in the sense of \"small, flat, sweet cake\" in American English. The American use is derived from Dutch koekje \"little cake,\"  which is a diminutive of \"koek\" (\"cake\"), which came from the Middle Dutch word \"koke\". Another claim is that the American name derives from the Dutch word koekje or more precisely its informal, dialect variant koekie which means little cake, and arrived in American English with the Dutch settlement of New Netherland, in the early 1600s.\nAccording to the Scottish National Dictionary, its Scottish name derives from the diminutive form  (+ suffix -ie) of the word cook, giving the Middle Scots cookie, cooky or cu(c)kie. There was much trade and cultural contact across the North Sea between the Low Countries and Scotland during the Middle Ages, which can also be seen in the history of curling and, perhaps, golf.\nCookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft, but some kinds of cookies are not baked at all. Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an array of ingredients including sugars, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried fruits. The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked.\nA general theory of cookies may be formulated this way. Despite its descent from cakes and other sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in cakes serves to make the base (in the case of cakes called \"batter\") as thin as possible, which allows the bubbles \u2013 responsible for a cake's fluffiness \u2013 to better form. In the cookie, the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils, whether they be in the form of butter, vegetable oils, or lard, are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much higher temperature than water. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is far denser after removal from the oven.\nOils in baked cakes do not behave as baking soda tends to in the finished result. Rather than evaporating and thickening the mixture, they remain, saturating the bubbles of escaped gases from what little water there might have been in the eggs, if added, and the carbon dioxide released by heating the baking powder. This saturation produces the most texturally attractive feature of the cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a moisture (namely oil) that does not sink into it.\nCookie-like hard wafers have existed for as long as baking is documented, in part because they deal with travel very well, but they were usually not sweet enough to be considered cookies by modern standards.\nCookies appear to have their origins in 7th century AD Persia, shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region. They spread to Europe through the Muslim conquest of Spain. By the 14th century, they were common in all levels of society throughout Europe, from royal cuisine to street vendors. The first documented instance of the figure-shaped gingerbread man was at the court of Elizabeth I of England in the 16th century. She had the gingerbread figures made and presented in the likeness of some of her important guests.\nWith global travel becoming widespread at that time, cookies made a natural travel companion, a modernized equivalent of the travel cakes used throughout history. One of the most popular early cookies, which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names, was the jumble, a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts, sweetener, and water.\nCookies came to America through the Dutch in New Amsterdam in the late 1620s. The Dutch word \"koekje\" was Anglicized to \"cookie\" or cooky. The earliest reference to cookies in America is in 1703, when \"The Dutch in New York provided...'in 1703...at a funeral 800 cookies...'\"\nThe most common modern cookie, given its style by the creaming of butter and sugar, was not common until the 18th century.

The treats are often packaged in groups of five to represent happiness, health, longevity, wealth, and fertility.  At Italian and Greek weddings, the almonds are placed in groups of five, an odd number that is indivisible to symbolize the unity of husband and wife. In the Middle East, Jordan almonds are considered an aphrodisiac so there are always plenty on hand for the newlyweds and their guests.\nJordan almonds are thought to originate in ancient Rome, where honey-covered almonds were introduced by a Roman baker and confectioner named Julius Dragatus. His confections were called dragati and were served by nobility at weddings and births. When sugar became more readily available in the 15th century, the nuts were coated in sugar instead. In Sulmona, Italy, the technique of creating the drag\u00e9e almonds was perfected by the Pelino family.\nThe term Jordan is most likely a corrupted version of the French word jardin, meaning \"garden\", hence, a cultivated rather than wild almond. However, others suggest the term referred to a variety of almonds originally grown along the Jordan River characterized by long, thin, slender, rather smooth kernels in thick, heavy shells.\nStill others believe that Jordan is a corruption of the name of the town of Verdun in the northeast of France. In the 13th century, when the medieval crusaders brought sugar to Europe after their campaigns in the Holy Land, it was very valuable and considered medicinal. During that time, an apothecary in Verdun began coating other medicines with sugar (calling them drag\u00e9es) to make them easier to take. The town of Verdun became very well known for its drag\u00e9es de Verdun.\nOther chocolate drag\u00e9es with multi-colored candy shells are M&M's. Initially designed to allow easy transport and consumption of chocolate for the U.S. military, they have evolved into a popular candy, but are also sold as decorative drag\u00e9es in 25 different colors.\nUsed to increase tolerability of bitter medication or merely to compel consumption, medicated candies or sugar-coated pills can be referred to as drag\u00e9es.\nAnother form of drag\u00e9e is a small sphere of sugar, in the Commonwealth often called a cachou, used primarily in the decoration of cookies, cakes, and other forms of bakery. These are produced in various sizes, typically 3 to 4\u00a0mm (0.12 to 0.16\u00a0in) in diameter. This is larger than nonpareils and smaller than large pearl tapioca.\nSilver drag\u00e9es have long been used for both wedding and holiday food decoration. More recently, metallic gold, copper, rainbow colors (red, green, blue, etc.), and pearlescent colors have become available.\nIn most countries, including the United Kingdom and France, silver drag\u00e9es are classified as food items.  However, since 1906, US regulations have prohibited the manufacture or sale of any food that uses any metal or mineral substance, including silver, as a food coloring, coating, or additive.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers the silver and gold metallic-finish sugar drag\u00e9es to be inedible, and they may be sold only when accompanied with a notice that they are to be used for decorative purposes only.  Almonds that have been coated the same way are not permitted at all.  Although the metallic-finish drag\u00e9es can be purchased in 49 US states, they are no longer sold in California.\nComfit\nJawbreakers\nJelly bean\nList of almond dishes\nSprinkles\nSugar plum\nSuikerboon\nfrom Ancient Greek  \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 (trag\u1e17mata)\u00a0'sweets, treats' (cf. \u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03b3\u03c9 'to eat'), through Latin trag\u0113mata 'sweets' and French drag\u00e9e 'a sweet with almond filling'\nfrom Italian  confetto\u00a0'confectionary', through Latin c\u014dnfectus, perfect passive participle of c\u014dnfici\u014d 'prepare, bring about, finish, perform'\nfrom Arabic  \u0645\u0644\u0628\u0633 (malbas)\u00a0'coated, covered'\nChu, Anita.

                "description": "Mititei or mici (both Romanian words meaning \"little ones\", \"small ones\") is a dish from the Romanian cuisine, consisting of grilled ground meat rolls in cylindrical shape made from a mixture of beef, lamb with spices, such as  garlic, black pepper, thyme, coriander, anise, savory, and sometimes a touch of paprika. Sodium bicarbonate and broth or water are also added to the mixture. It is similar to evapi and other ground meat based dishes throughout the Balkans and Middle East. It is often served with french fries, mustard and murturi (pickled vegetables).",

A popular story claims that the mici were invented in the late 19th century by one Iordache Ionescu, a cook working in one of the many busy pubs in the Lipscani district of Bucharest, named \"La o idee\" (roughly \"The Idea\"). According to the legend, Ionescu was famous for his fresh sausages, but during a particularly busy day he ran out of casing and the idea of placing only the filling of the sausage on the grill came to him. The improvised new dish proved an instant hit and their popularity continued to grow ever since. The famous nearby restaurant Caru' cu Bere is also sometimes given as the birthplace of the mici. \nRegardless, the dish is first mentioned in 1870 by French-Romanian journalist Ulysse de Marsillac, and around 1872 they get their name from writer and humorist N. T. Or\u0103\u0219anu, who writes about eating them in Ionescu's pub. Similar varieties of skinless sausages appear in contemporary cooking books by Ecaterina Steriady (1871) and J.C. Hin\u021bescu (1877).\nThroughout the years, the recipe lost some of the original ingredients, such as caraway seeds and allspice, and began being made with pork, rather than beef and lamb. Sodium bicarbonate, a raising agent, is also commonly added to the modern Romanian recipe, which improves both the flavor and the texture.\nMici are very popular all across Romania, with an estimated 440 million mici consumed each year in Romania. They are eaten in homes, restaurants and pubs, but are probably most associated with outdoor grilling. As many Romanians celebrate International Workers' Day (1 May) by going to barbecues and picnics, mici have become strongly associated with the holiday in recent years, 30 million mititei being eaten in Romania on the first day of May in 2019. Mici are sometimes called the \"national dish of Romania\" in the media, despite lacking any such official designation.\nIn 2018, between 5% and 10% of all the mici produced in Romania were exported, mainly to countries with large Romanian diasporas, such as Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\u0106evapi, a Balkan dish\nDry meatballs\nKebapcheta\nKebab\nChiftele - another Romanian dish\nP\u00e2rjoale - another Romanian dish\nMarola, Eugen (29 March 2019). \"Locul \u00een care s-a n\u0103scut gloriosul mic rom\u00e2nesc: c\u00e2rciuma lui Iordache Ionescu de pe Covaci no.3\".

Traditionally served at breakfast on Easter morning, or as an appetizer during Easter lunch, it is accompanied by blessed boiled eggs, ciauscolo and red wine  or, again, served at the Easter Monday picnic.

The name pizza is here to be understood not in the recent meaning that has spread into Italian through the Neapolitan language, but in the original medieval Latin meaning of 'focaccia', thus suggesting an ancient origin of the dish. Similar preparations ('Pizza alla rustica', 'Pizza di Ricotta') can be found in cookery manuals from the early 19th century such as that of Vincenzo Agnoletti.\nAccording to tradition, the pizza di Pasqua was first made in the Middle Ages by the nuns of the Poor Clares monastery of Santa Maria Maddalena at Serra de' Conti near Ancona. The name crescia (by which it is known throughout the Marche region) refers to the \"growth\" (it. \"crescita\"), that is the dough growth due to the leavening process during baking. The first mention of the preparation of the crescia di Pasqua can be found in a cookbook written by the nuns and dating to 1848, entitled Memorie delle cresce di Pasqua fatte nel 1848 (\"Memories of the crescie di Pasqua made in 1848\") and, later, in an anonymous Loreto cookbook of 1864 entitled Il cuoco delle Marche (\"The Cook of Marche\").\n\nRecipe books dating back to the 1800s describe the recipe as follows: \"For 3 crescie, and one for the father confessor, it takes 16 pounds of flour, a half of milk, eggs 40, 3 ounces of salt, pepper, an ounce and half of lard, 3 pounds of dry cheese and 8 of fresh cheese, included with the eyes, 2 little fogliette of oil, and half paolo of good saffron, and this dose is enough for 24 people and father confessor\". The 40 eggs provided in this recipe had to remember the 40 days of Lent.\nAn alternative recipe described in the Memorie delle crescie di Pasqua fatte in 1848 requires \"flour 50 pounds, grated old cheese 10 pounds, fresh cheese in judgment, milk 3 and a half jug, oil 4 pounds and a half, or as many as necessary, salt 1 pound and 3 ounces, pepper 3 ounces\".\nThe main ingredients are wheat flour, eggs, grated pecorino, grated parmesan (or grana padano), chopped pecorino cheese, extra-virgin olive oil, salt, pepper, natural yeast and milk. Some recipes include the addition of other ingredients, such as saffron, or their substitution with similar ingredients, such as lard or butter instead of oil and emmental cheese instead of pecorino.\nThe dough must be worked for a long time to allow the formation of the gluten mesh and promote leavening. The dough is then divided and placed in special molds which, covered and kept in a damp place, are subjected to a long leavening process and then cooked, according to tradition, in a wood-fired oven (formerly they were brought to a nearby bakery to be cooked).\nAccording to religious tradition, the pizza di Pasqua should be prepared on Maundy Thursday or Good Friday to be eaten at Easter, following the period of fasting and abstinence dictated by Lent. Once ready, it was customary to bring the pizza di Pasqua to the church, so that it would be blessed together with the other foods to be consumed on Easter day.\nIn the Umbria-Marche areas there is also a sweet variant. This sweet pie, without cheese, with candied fruits or without, in addition to the presence of sugar has also a fiocca, that is a meringue glazed with sugar beads.\n\"Colazione di Pasqua in Umbria\" (in Italian).

Folar de Chaves, popular in the north-eastern Portuguese regions of Chaves and Valpaos, is stuffed with pork, ham, salpico and linguia.

Although b\u00e1nh t\u00e9t or b\u00e1nh t\u00e0y are made and consumed during T\u1ebft (the Vietnamese new year), the \"t\u00e9t\" in the food's name literally means \"sliced\" or \"split\", possibly referring to the fact that it is served in slices. \"B\u00e1nh\" is used to refer to various baked and grilled food including small packages or \"cakes\", sandwiches, crepes, and spring rolls.\nThe process of making b\u00e1nh t\u00e9t usually begins in preparation for T\u1ebft where the ingredients are prepared then cooked for at least six hours in a pot of boiling water. The first step is assembling the ingredients - glutinous rice, mung bean paste or soaked mung bean and pork belly. Next, the ingredients are layered on top of banana leaves before wrapped together tightly with strings.  To prevent the banana leaf from coming apart during cooking,  b\u00e1nh t\u00e9t are usually wrapped again several times with a length of plastic ribbon or rope before boiling in a large pot of water.\nB\u00e1nh t\u00e9t (or the original b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng) is a must-have traditional food in Vietnamese Lunar New Year. It demonstrates the importance of rice in the Vietnamese culture as well as historical value. During Vietnamese T\u1ebft, family members would gather together and enjoy feasting on b\u00e1nh t\u00e9t, the central food of this festive Vietnamese holiday to celebrate the coming of spring. The process of making b\u00e1nh t\u00e9t is time consuming, but a tradition that many families still practice even in this modern society where pre-made b\u00e1nh t\u00e9t and b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng are sold virtually in every Vietnamese store. It is the effort that counts and many choose to spend time with their family to create the holiday treat the traditional way. The process of making b\u00e1nh t\u00e9t is to provide an opportunity for family members to bond and come together to celebrate the holiday spirit.\nThe cake is eaten during the Vietnamese Lunar New Year holiday, dipped in fish sauce with or without chilli, and can be eaten together with pickled scallions. The cake can also be fried.\nB\u00e1nh t\u00e9t are traditional to and most popular in central and  southern Vietnam. A similar food (though rectangular in shape) is called b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng in the north.  According to historian Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c V\u01b0\u1ee3ng, b\u00e1nh t\u00e9t is a version of b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng derived during Vietnam's process of Nam ti\u1ebfn (southward expansion) in the 17th century. According to legend, b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng was first made 4,000 years ago by Prince Lang Lieu. The cakes were round and squared shapes, the round Day cake symbolizing the sky and the square Chung cake symbolizing the Earth.\nB\u00e1nh t\u00e9t chu\u1ed1i is a bundle of rice with banana and sweet red bean filling steamed in banana leaves. This is the typical sweet version of b\u00e1nh t\u00e9t.\nIn Cambodia, b\u00e1nh t\u00e9t are known as ansom or num ansom (\u1793\u17c6\u17a2\u1793\u17d2\u179f\u1798, num \u00e2ns\u00e2m).\nB\u00e1nh\nB\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng\nB\u00e1nh t\u1ebb\nHallaca\nList of stuffed dishes\nLo mai gai\nLotus leaf wrap\nMochi\nPamonha\nPasteles\nTamale\nZongzi\nCorunda\nBnh\nAvieli, Nir (2005-03-22). \"Vietnamese New Year rice cakes: iconic festive dishes and contested national identity\".

Chikki is a traditional Indian sweet (brittle) generally made from nuts and jaggery/sugar. There are several different varieties of chikki in addition to the most common groundnut (peanut) chikki. Each variety of chikki is named after the ingredients used, which include puffed or roasted Bengal gram, sesame, puffed rice, beaten rice, or khobra (desiccated coconut), and other nuts such as almonds, cashews and pistachios. \nIn regions of North India, especially Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, this sweet is called layiya patti. In Sindh and Sindhi regions of India, it is called layee or lai and in other north Indian states, it is also known as gajak or maroonda. In Bangladesh, West Bengal and other Bengali-speaking regions, it is known as gur badam. In the South Indian states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, it is called palli patti. In Kerala it is called Kappalandi muthai. In Tamil Nadu it is called kadalai mittai. Similar dishes are also very popular in Brazil, where it is known as p\u00e9-de-moleque, and in Paraguay, where it is called ka'i ladrillo.\nThe preparation of chikkis consists of first preparing the hot jaggery syrup with a minimum of water, adding nuts to the syrup to coat them (with the syrup) and then transferring the nuts to a wooden mould, then rolling them to a thickness of about 6\u20138\u00a0mm using a wooden roller, then placing into a steel plate for cooling, cutting into slabs, and packing. In homes, smaller quantities are hand rolled with wooden rollers.\nMost popular chikkis are sourced from the Indian towns of Bhuj in Gujarat;  Kovilpatti in Tamil Nadu; Standard Cold Pressed Oil Madurai, Palakkad , Central Travancore, Kannur, Cherthala in Kerala, Lonavala, Matheran, Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani, and Karjat in Maharashtra.\nGajak, a similar candy with sesame seeds\nKovilpatti\nLonavala chikki\nPeanut brittle, a similar candy with a lower proportion of nuts\nGozinaki\nList of peanut dishes\nTameletjie\nAlegr\u00eda (Mexican candy)\nP\u00e9-de-moleque\nChitrodia, Rucha Biju. \"A low-cal twist to sweet sensations\".

A bonbon is a small chocolate confection.

Its use originated in the seventeenth century within the French royal court, and spread to other European countries by the eighteenth century. Bonbons began to be served in ornate containers by the middle of the eighteenth century, which would be given as gifts at festivals and on holidays such as New Year's Day.\nInspired by bonbons, Johann Strauss II wrote the waltz Wiener Bonbons in 1866. Its title page shows the composition's name in the form of twisted bonbon wrappers.\nAccording to French law, a chocolate candy or bonbon de chocolat must be at least 25% chocolate and can come in several forms:\na bite-sized chocolate;\nan arrangement of different chocolates;\na mixture of chocolate and other edible ingredients.\nSpecifically in the United States, the phrase \"Bon Bon\" can also refer to The Hershey Company's trademarked name of a frozen confection made from vanilla ice cream and covered in chocolate.\nPralines\nBuckeye candy\n\"cioccolatino in Vocabolario\".

The type of sugar and whipping agent varies depending on desired characteristics. The marshmallow is a foam, consisting of an aqueous continuous phase and a gaseous dispersed phase (in other words, a liquid with gas bubbles spread throughout). In addition to being a foam, this also makes marshmallows an \"aerated\" confection because it is made up of 50% air. The goal of an aerated confection like a marshmallow is to incorporate gas into a sugar mixture, and stabilize the aerated product before the gas can escape. When the gas is introduced into the system, tiny air bubbles are created. ...",

Marshmallow (UK: /m\u0251\u02d0r\u0283\u02c8m\u00e6lo\u028a/, US: /\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0r\u0283m\u025blo\u028a, -m\u00e6l-/) is a type of confectionery that is typically made from sugar, water and gelatin whipped to a solid-but-soft consistency. It is used as a filling in baking or normally  molded into shapes and coated with corn starch. The sugar confection is inspired by a historical medicinal confection made from Althaea officinalis, the marsh-mallow plant.\nThe word \"marshmallow\" comes from the mallow plant species (Althaea officinalis), a herb native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and Asia which grows in marshes and other damp areas. The plant's stem and leaves are fleshy, and its white flower has five petals. It is not known exactly when marshmallows were invented, but their history goes back as early as 2000\u00a0BCE. Ancient Egyptians were said to be the first to make and use the root of the plant to soothe coughs and sore throats and to heal wounds. The first marshmallows were prepared by boiling pieces of root pulp with honey until thick. Once thickened, the mixture was strained, cooled, then used as intended.\nWhether used for candy or medicine, the manufacture of marshmallows was limited to a small scale. In the early- to mid-1800s, the marshmallow had made its way to France, where confectioners augmented the plant's traditional medicinal value with indulgent ingredients utilized by the Egyptians. Owners of small candy stores would whip the sap from the mallow root into a fluffy candy mold. This candy, called P\u00e2te de Guimauve, was a spongy-soft dessert made from whipping dried marshmallow roots with sugar, water, and egg whites. It was sold in bar form as a lozenge. Drying and preparation of the marshmallow took one-to-two days before the final product was produced. In the late 1800s, candy makers started looking for a new process and discovered the starch mogul system, in which trays of modified corn starch had a mold firmly pushed down in them to create cavities within the starch. The cavities were then filled with the whipped marshmallow sap mixture and allowed to cool or harden. At the same time, candy makers began to replace the mallow root with gelatin which created a stable form of marshmallow.\nBy the early 1900s, thanks to the starch mogul system, marshmallows were introduced to the United States and available for mass consumption. They were sold in tins as penny candy and were soon used in a variety of food recipes like banana fluff, lime mallow sponge, and tutti frutti. In 1956, Alex Doumak patented the extrusion process which involved running marshmallow ingredients through tubes. The tubes created a long rope of marshmallow mixture and were then set out to cool. The ingredients were then cut into equal pieces and packaged.\nModern marshmallow manufacturing is highly automated and has been since the early 1950s when the extrusion process was first developed. Numerous improvements and advancements allow for the production of thousands of pounds of marshmallow a day. Today, the marshmallow typically consists of four ingredients: sugar, water, air, and a whipping agent (usually a protein). The type of sugar and whipping agent varies depending on desired characteristics. Each ingredient plays a specific role in the final product.\nConfectioners in early 19th century France pioneered the innovation of whipping up the marshmallow sap and sweetening it to make a confection similar to modern marshmallow. The confection was made locally by the owners of small sweet shops. They would extract the sap from the mallow plant's root and whip it themselves. The candy was very popular, but its manufacture was labour-intensive. In the late 19th century, French manufacturers thought of using egg whites or gelatin, combined with modified corn starch, to create the chewy base. This avoided the labour-intensive extraction process, but it did require industrial methods to combine the gelatin and corn starch in the right way.\nAnother milestone in the production of marshmallows was the development of the extrusion process by the Greek American confectioner Alex Doumak, of Doumak Inc., in the late 1940s. In this process, which Doumak patented in 1956, marshmallow mixture is pumped through extrusion heads with numerous ports aligned next to each other which form continuous \"ropes\" of marshmallow. This invention allowed marshmallows to be manufactured in a fully automated way and gives us the familiar cylindrical shape of today's marshmallow. To make marshmallows in large quantities, industrial confectioners mix water, sugar, and corn syrup in massive kettles which are then heated to a precise temperature and cooked for a precise time. This mixture is then pumped into another kettle to cool. Once the mixture has cooled enough to not denature the gelatin, the re-hydrated gelatin",

In this state, sugars are unstable. In ring form, sugars are stable and therefore exist in this form in most foods, including lollipops. Sugar is a very versatile ingredient and is used in a wide variety of food products. Sugar interacts differently depending on the presence of other ingredients and on various treatments. ...",

A lollipop is a type of sugar candy usually consisting of hard candy mounted on a stick and intended for sucking or licking. Different informal terms are used in different places, including lolly, sucker, sticky-pop, etc. Lollipops are available in many flavors and shapes.\nLollipops are available in a number of colors and flavors, particularly fruit flavors. With numerous companies producing lollipops, the candy now comes in dozens of flavors and many different shapes. Lollipops can range from very small candies bought in bulk and given away as a courtesy at banks, barbershops, and other locations, to very large treats made from candy canes twisted into a spiral shape.\nMost lollipops are eaten at room temperature, but \"ice lollipops\", \"ice lollies\", or \"popsicles\" are frozen water-based lollipops. Similar confections on a stick made of ice cream, often with a flavored coating, are usually not called by this name.\nSome lollipops contain fillings, such as bubble gum or soft candy. Some novelty lollipops have more unusual items, such as mealworm larvae, embedded in the candy.\nOther novelty lollipops have non-edible centers, such as a flashing light embedded within the candy; there is also a trend, principally in North America, of lollipops with sticks attached to a motorized device that makes the candy spin around in one's mouth.\nIn the Nordic countries, Germany, and the Netherlands, some lollipops are flavored with salmiak.\nLollipops can be used to carry medicines.\nSome lollipops have been marketed for use as diet aids, although their effectiveness is untested, and anecdotal cases of weight loss may be due to the power of suggestion. Flavored lollipops containing medicine are intended to give children medicine without fuss.\nActiq is a powerful analgesic lollipop whose active ingredient is fentanyl. Often, patients utilizing large amounts of opioid pain medication take Actiq lozenges on a handle in order to control breakthrough cancer pain.\nThe idea of an edible candy on a stick is very simple, and it is probable that the lollipop has been invented and reinvented numerous times. The first confectioneries that closely resemble what we call lollipops date to the Middle Ages, when the nobility would often eat boiled sugar with the aid of sticks or handles.\nThe invention of the modern lollipop is still something of a mystery but a number of American companies in the early 20th century have laid claim to it. According to the book Food for Thought: Extraordinary Little Chronicles of the World, they were invented by George Smith of New Haven, Connecticut, who started making large hard candies mounted on sticks in 1908. He named them after a racehorse of the time, Lolly Pop - and trademarked the lollipop name in 1931.\nThe term 'lollipop' was recorded by English lexicographer Francis Grose in 1796. The term may have derived from the term \"lolly\" (tongue) and \"pop\" (slap). The first references to the lollipop in its modern context date to the 1920s. Alternatively, it may be a word of Romany origin being related to the Roma tradition of selling candy apples on a stick. Red apple in the Romany language is loli phaba.\nWhile the main functional ingredients of a lollipop are quite simple, the process of making such confections can be complex. The formation and physical state of the glassy amorphous structure used in the creation of the lollipop is an involved chemical process. The first step in making lollipops after mixing the main ingredients is the heating process. During heating, the molecules increase in their translational mobility and therefore begin to resemble liquids. Although many hard candies are heated to about 310\u02daF, the temperature that the solution is heated to is dependent on the specific volume and contents of the mixture. After heating is complete, the solution can then be cooled. The final cooled solution is a supersaturated due to the moisture content dropping below 2%. Supersaturated or supercooled liquids are also formed  due to inhibitors preventing crystallization. They are unstable because crystallization is a favored reaction in this case. During the cooling process, the most important physicochemical characteristic of lollipops, the glass transition process, occurs.\nGlass transition is the solid-liquid transformation of amorphous material. It is a reversible change of the solid and liquid states of supercooled liquids. Glass transition occurs approximately 100\u02daC-150\u02daC below the equilibrium melting temperature of a pure substance. This dynamic transition is not a change of state, but a change of phase. It can be looked at in terms of a change in the molecular motion of the liquid, not a change in the molecular order itself. This",

Although American, persimmon pudding is similar to traditional English dessert puddings, such as Christmas pudding (raisin or fig) or quince pudding. This style of pudding is generally either steamed or cooked in an oven with a water bath (also called a bain-marie). These methods of cooking ensure the pudding remains moist and does not dry out or form a crust unlike the sweet but crusted persimmon bread. The pudding is often served with ice cream, crme anglaise, whipped cream, apple sauce, or hard sauce, which is sometimes called brandy sauce. It is traditionally served warm, though it can be served cold as well. ...",

Furthermore, it closely resembles an English trifle in that it is assembled in layers and includes custard, fruit, sponge cake, and whipped cream.

Over time, the wafers will absorb the custard and the layers will press together causing the flavors to intermingle.\nThe National Banana Pudding Festival is held at the Centerville River Park in Centerville, Tennessee.

In contrast to the New York-style bagel, which also contains sourdough, the Montreal bagel is smaller, thinner, sweeter and denser, with a larger hole, and is always baked in a wood-fired oven. It contains malt, egg, and no salt, and is boiled in honey-sweetened water before being baked. In some Montreal establishments, bagels are still produced by hand and baked in full view of the patrons. There are two predominant varieties: black-seed (poppy seed), or white-seed (sesame seed).",

Montreal bagels, like the similarly shaped New York bagel, were brought to North America by Jewish immigrants from Poland and other Eastern European countries; the differences in texture and taste reflect the style of the particular area in Poland in which the immigrant bakers learned their trade. Minor controversy surrounds the question of who first brought the bagel to Montreal. They were (reportedly) first baked in Montreal by Chaim (Hyman) Seligman, as verified by Montreal historian Joe King, a historian of Montreal Jewry. Seligman first worked in the neighbourhood community of Lachine and later moved his bakery to the lane next door to Schwartz's Delicatessen on Boulevard St. Laurent in central Montreal. Seligman would string his bagels into dozens and patrol Jewish Main purveying his wares, originally with a pushcart, then a horse and wagon and still later from a converted taxi. Seligman went into partnership with Myer Lewkowicz and with Jack Shlafman but fell out with both of them. Seligman and Lewkowicz founded the St. Viateur Bagel Shop in 1957 and Shlafman established Fairmount Bagel in 1919, which both still exist in the present day.\nA substantial proportion of Montreal's English-speaking Jewish community gradually left for other locales. Catering to this population, Montreal-style bagel shops have opened in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton, Calgary, Whitehorse, and other Canadian, and even US cities, such as Burlington, Houston, Los Angeles, Oakland, Portland, and Seattle. For a time this style of bagel was almost completely unknown in the northeastern U.S. despite its proximity to Montreal, mainly due to the proximity of the rival New York City bagel. (with one exception having been in Burlington, Vermont, where Myer's Bagels boasts a Montreal-style wood-fired oven and Lloyd Squires, a former St-Viateur Bagel Shop baker). At one point in New York City there were two Montreal-style bagel locations in the borough of Brooklyn within four blocks of each other, but one is now closed and the other no longer offers Montreal-style bagels.\nMontreal-style bagels are currently the only style of bagel known to have ventured into space. Gregory Chamitoff, who grew up in Montreal, took three bags of sesame bagels with him on his assignments to STS-124 as passenger and ISS Expedition 17 as crewmember.\nMontreal-style bagels are, for the most part, manufactured by the same method used to produce a generic bagel.\nThe Montreal-style method of making bagels builds on the basic traditional method in the following ways:\nThe basic bagel dough recipe includes egg and honey.\nHoney is also added to the water used for poaching the bagels before baking.\nThe authentic Montreal-Style bagels are baked in a wood-fired oven.\nSeveral Montreal bagel factories produce authentic Montreal-style bagels. St-Viateur Bagel, at 263 av. St-Viateur West, and Fairmount Bagel, at 74 Avenue Fairmount Ouest are two notable bagel shops in Montreal. Both claim to be the oldest bagel shop in the city.\nCuisine of Quebec\nBublik\nDonald Bell\nKettleman's Bagel Co.\nMile End, Montreal\nMontreal-style smoked meat\nUrban culture\n\"Crusty Bran Bagels are an Ethnic Treat\".

Paling in 't groen is a Flemish regional dish, mainly from the area along the River Scheldt between Dendermonde and Antwerp. The Dutch language name (literally 'Eel in the Green')  refers to freshwater eel in a green herb sauce. The traditionally home-made meal is also sold fully prepared but still uncooked by some fishmongers' shops or market stalls, and can be enjoyed in specialty restaurants.\nThe local river eel has become rare or unwanted because of pollution. Since eel farms offer a very fat and gastronomically less desirable product, wild eel is usually imported. It has become a threatened and very expensive species.\nList of fish dishes\nPaling in 't groen Archived 2011-10-07 at the Wayback Machine, Visit Flanders US (Retrieved 30 June 2011)\nPaling in 't groen, een klassieker uit de Scheldestreek!

Coda alla vaccinara [\u02c8ko\u02d0da alla vatt\u0283i\u02c8na\u02d0ra] is an oxtail stew in modern Roman cuisine including various vegetables, notably celery. The tail is considered offal, nicknamed in Rome the quinto quarto 'the fifth fourth'.\nCoda alla vaccinara was originally the specialty of the vaccinari 'butchers' of the Rione Regola in Rome, to the point that the inhabitants of that rione were nicknamed in Romanesco dialect magnacode, 'tail-eaters'. It is often found in the trattorie of Testaccio and Trastevere.\nCoda is the favourite dish of the protagonist Giacinto Mazzatella (Nino Manfredi) in Down and Dirty.

Another method, invented in 1936 by Shield's Date Garden, involves the use of date crystals, dried \"nubbins\" of dates that are sweetened with date sugar. The crystals are then mixed with water to create a paste before being blended with other ingredients. An alternative method involves baking the dates, which are then blended to a paste-like consistency. Date shakes are high in fiber, iron, potassium, and niacin. They have a high sugar and calorific content.",

A date shake is a milkshake made with dates. The drink originated in, and is particularly associated with, the Coachella Valley in California.\nAt the end of the 19th century into the beginning of the 20th, plant explorers from the USDA were sent to search globally for new crops that could be farmed in North America. These explorers returned with date palms from North Africa and the Middle East. The explorer, Walter Swingle brought back six medjool date offshoots from a Moroccan oasis; these six offshoot specimens \"account for all the megool dates grown in the US.\"  \nIn 1928, Russ Nicholl (sometimes spelled Nichol) and his family built a roadside shack near Thermal, California. Another news source states that Nichol built his shack in 1919. A few years later, this shack was expanded and named Valerie Jean after Nicholl's daughter. With electricity and refrigeration, the Nicholls were able to offer variations of ingredients blended with their supply of dates. Nichol was reportedly inspired by stories of nomads in the Middle East who he heard \"lived entirely on dates and goat\u2019s milk\".\nIn 1924 Floyd and Bess Shields opened the Shields Date Garden in Indio to compete with the quickly growing date industry in Coachella Valley.\nThe Coachella Valley has numerous date shake shops, many of them are located on Highway 111. The small desert town of Westmoreland, where medjool dates are grown, and Indio, where Shields is located, are known for their date shakes. The drink has been called the \"unofficial drink of the Coachella Valley\" or the \"unofficial drink of Palm Springs.\"\nThey are a popular drink at the Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival and during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.\nBleiberg, Larry (2 May 2018). \"The Worlds Ultimate Milkshake?\".

Dodol is a sweet toffee-like sugar palm-based confection commonly found in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Originating from the culinary traditions of Indonesia, it is also popular in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, the Philippines, South India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma, where it is called mont kalama. It is made from coconut milk, jaggery, and rice flour, and is sticky, thick, and sweet.\nThe history of dodol production is closely related to one of its main ingredients, gula aren or palm sugar, a traditional sugar made from the sap of Arenga pinnata plant, and also rice flour. It is a popular sweet treat and one of the oldest indigenous sweets developed in the Maritime Southeast Asia. The exact origin of dodol is unclear; while there is a remarkable diversity in preparations of the product within the island communities of Java and Sumatra, the variants tend to be adaptations of post-colonial crops. \"Dodol\" is a word of Sundanese origin, whereas in Javanese it is called jenang.\nDodol is believed to have been introduced to Southern India and Sri Lanka by migrants from Indonesia. It has also been attributed to the Portuguese, who occupied parts of the country during the 16th and 17th centuries. Several dodol recipes have been developed in Sri Lanka, such as kalu dodol. Dodol is very famous recipe in kilakarai, Tamil Nadu.It was possibly believed to introduce by Sri Lankan Muslim immigrants.\nIn Muslim majority countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, dodol is commonly served during festivals, such as Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha as sweet treats for children. The Betawi people take pride in making homemade dodol during the Lebaran (Eid ul-Fitr), where family members will gather together to make dodol. Traditional home made dodol Betawi production center is located in Pasar Minggu area, South Jakarta.\nDodol is also popular among the Roman Catholics from the Indian west coast, also known as the former Estado da \u00cdndia Portuguesa, which includes East Indians from Mumbai, the state of Goa, and the city of Mangalore. Dodol Hj Ideris manufactures dodol and the company has now entered the Middle Eastern market, including Iran.\nA related dessert in the Philippines is known as kalamay (literally \"sugar\"), which is made from sugarcane sugar instead of palm sugar. It also has a liquid consistency unlike dodol, since it uses ground glutinous rice rather than rice flour. However, the basic ingredients and preparation is similar. In Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago of the southern Philippines, dodol is more similar to the Indonesian and Malaysian variants and is known by the same name. It is usually prepared into thick cylinders wrapped in corn husks or coloured cellophane that is then cut into disks before serving. Although, like the kalamay, Filipino dodol is made with ground glutinous rice paste and muscovado sugarcane sugar, not palm sugar.\n\nThere is a diverse variety of dodol recipes found in Indonesia. The town of Garut in West Java is the main production center of dodol in Indonesia. Many flavours of dodol are available, including a durian flavor called lempuk, which is popular in Medan and other Sumatran cities. A major producer of Garut-style dodol incorporates chocolate as an ingredient into a specialized variant product, with the intention of producing edible souvenirs from the city called 'chocodot' or chocolate dodol.\nOther variants include:\nDodol bengkoang contains jicama.\nDodol kacang hijau contains mung beans.\nDodol tape contains tapai, a fermented rice product\nDodol ubi talam contains yam.\nDodol sirsak contains soursop.\nDodol nangka contains jackfruit.\nDodol lidah buaya contains aloe vera.\nDodol apel Malang contains apple, and is a speciality of Malang city, East Java.\nDodol susu is from Pangalengan, Bandung, West Java. It contains milk.\nDodol tomat contains tomato.\nDodol salak contains salak.\nDodol rumput laut contains seaweed.\nDodol pisang contains banana.\nDodol nenas contains pineapple.\nDodol mangga contains mango.\nDodol China is an Indonesian Chinese version of sweet nian gao with rich coconut sugar.\nDodol Betawi is made by the Betawi people in Jakarta from a mixture of white and black glutinous rice.\nIn colloquial Indonesian, dodol can also be used as a slang term for the word 'bodoh' to refer a person as being 'stupid' or 'illogical'. It is impolite to refer a person as 'dodol'.\nMochi\nCaramel candy\nButterscotch\nKalamay\nNian gao\nKulolo\nWibisono Notodirdjo (7 August 2011). \"Sweet treats from the past\". The Jakarta Post.

Birnen, Bohnen und Speck (\"pears, beans and bacon\") is a North German dish which is especially popular in the states of Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Hamburg. It also goes under the names of Bohnen, Birnen und Speck and, locally, the Low German names of Gr\u00f6\u00f6ner Hein and Gr\u00f6nen Heini (lit: \"Green Harry\"). The ingredients required mean that the dish is mainly eaten in the months of August and September.\nThe dish is a type of stew, in which\u2014as the name indicates\u2014the main ingredients are pears, beans and bacon. In North German country kitchens, potatoes would also be added, even though they are not specifically mentioned.\nGenerally cut French beans (Brechbohnen) are used. In Hamburg on the markets occasionally \"Turkish peas\" may be found, despite its name a Vierlande bean variety that used to be frequently used for this dish. During preparation several sprigs of savory are added to the beans.\nThe pears used for this dish are cooking pears which would otherwise be inedible eaten as fruit in their own right. They are small, green, rock-hard and do not have the sweetness and juiciness of the popular eating varieties. These pears are mainly found at markets and in small vegetable shops. In the Hamburg area, other varieties are used: the Vierl\u00e4nder and the rather sweeter Finkenwerder cooking pears. The Vierl\u00e4nder sort have a slightly firmer consistency after cooking which is preferred by many.\nThese cooking pears are only available from July to September, subject to the weather. As a last resort for those who have missed the right season, B\u00fcrgermeisterbirne pears may be used. They are not as sweet when raw and are clearly sweeter.\nThe bacon used is streaky, smoky bacon. Here, too, it is important if the dish is to taste its best not to use 'any old bacon'. The origin\u2014whether from the Vierlande, the Black Forest or Tyrol\u2014is immaterial; all of them are suitable and offer a variety of interesting flavours. The deciding factor is the storage of the bacon. Only streaky bacon that has been air-dried and stored produces when cooked that pleasant taste of seasoned fat that melts in the mouth. Bacon, which\u2014as is common today\u2014has been stored hygienically in its vacuum wrapper, only produces a sort of fibrous stringiness after being cooked.\nThe Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein preference is to add potatoes to their Bohnen, Birnen und Speck that are still firm when cooked\u2014such as the Cilena or Linda varieties. In Land Hadeln beef or lamb can also be cooked along with the bacon.\nList of stews\n",

It is a salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, bottarga, and dried tuna dressed with olive oil.\nCappon magro means 'fast-day capon'. As the dish contains no ingredients considered meat under the rules of traditional Catholic fasting, it is a suitable meal for the traditional Catholic fast days, including Christmas Eve. 'Capon' may be a wry reference to the poultry capon, a traditional dish for Christmas.  Or it may refer to the biscuit base, comparable to the French 'chapon', a slice of bread rubbed with garlic which is placed in the bottom of a soup or salad bowl. It may also refer to one of the many fish called 'cappone' (perhaps a gurnard or red mullet).\nThe Naples dish called \"Caponata Estiva\" 'Summer Caponata', \"Caponata Napolitana\", or \"Caponata di Pesce\" consists of moistened ring-shaped rusks (friselle or gallette) dressed with oil, salt, garlic, oregano and basil, and topped with sliced tomatoes and possibly tuna. Any number of additional ingredients are optional, including smoked herring, pickled vegetables, olives, capers, anchovies, sardines, hard boiled eggs, very thinly sliced boiled beef, cucumber, carrot, celery.\nCappon magro is a traditional dish for Christmas Eve.\nList of Italian dishes\nList of salads\nCuisine of Liguria\nTouring Club Italiano, Guida all'Italia gastronomica, p. 192\nWaverly Root, The Food of Italy, 1971, ISBN\u00a00-394-72429-1, p. 362\nGillian Riley, The Oxford Companion to Italian Food, p. 290\nJeanne C.

It is a salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, bottarga, and dried tuna dressed with olive oil.\nCappon magro means 'fast-day capon'. As the dish contains no ingredients considered meat under the rules of traditional Catholic fasting, it is a suitable meal for the traditional Catholic fast days, including Christmas Eve. 'Capon' may be a wry reference to the poultry capon, a traditional dish for Christmas.  Or it may refer to the biscuit base, comparable to the French 'chapon', a slice of bread rubbed with garlic which is placed in the bottom of a soup or salad bowl. It may also refer to one of the many fish called 'cappone' (perhaps a gurnard or red mullet).\nThe Naples dish called \"Caponata Estiva\" 'Summer Caponata', \"Caponata Napolitana\", or \"Caponata di Pesce\" consists of moistened ring-shaped rusks (friselle or gallette) dressed with oil, salt, garlic, oregano and basil, and topped with sliced tomatoes and possibly tuna. Any number of additional ingredients are optional, including smoked herring, pickled vegetables, olives, capers, anchovies, sardines, hard boiled eggs, very thinly sliced boiled beef, cucumber, carrot, celery.\nCappon magro is a traditional dish for Christmas Eve.\nList of Italian dishes\nList of salads\nCuisine of Liguria\nTouring Club Italiano, Guida all'Italia gastronomica, p. 192\nWaverly Root, The Food of Italy, 1971, ISBN\u00a00-394-72429-1, p. 362\nGillian Riley, The Oxford Companion to Italian Food, p. 290\nJeanne C.

Poke /po\u028a\u02c8ke\u026a/ (Hawaiian for \"to slice\" or \"cut crosswise into pieces\"; sometimes stylized 'pok\u00e9' to aid pronunciation) is diced raw fish served either as an appetizer or a main course and is one of the main dishes of Native Hawaiian cuisine. Traditional forms are aku (skipjack tuna) and he\u02bbe (octopus). He\u02bbe (octopus) poke is usually called by its Japanese name tako pok\u00e9/poki, except in places like the island of Ni\u02bbihau where the Hawaiian language is spoken. Increasingly popular ahi poke is made with yellowfin tuna. Adaptations may feature raw salmon or various shellfish as a main ingredient served raw with the common poke seasonings. Poke differs from other raw fish dishes like ceviche, kinilaw or umai in that it does not use citrus fruits as a curing agent.\nThe traditional Hawaiian poke consists of fish that has been gutted, skinned, and deboned. It is served with traditional condiments such as sea salt, candlenut, seaweed, and limu.\nAccording to the food historian Rachel Laudan, the present form of poke became popular around the 1970s. It used skinned, deboned, and filleted raw fish served with Hawaiian salt, seaweed, and roasted, ground candlenut meat. This form of poke is still common in the Hawaiian islands.\nBeginning around 2012, poke became increasingly popular in North America. From 2014 to mid-2016, \"the number of Hawaiian restaurants on Foursquare, which includes those that serve poke,\" doubled, going from 342 to 700. These restaurants serve both traditional and modern versions of the dish. The modern version is sometimes called pok\u00e9 bowl, and has the ingredients arranged in a grouped way rather than mixed. Variations may include avocado, ponzu sauce, teriyaki sauce, mushrooms, crispy onions, pickled jalape\u00f1o, sriracha sauce, cilantro, pineapple, or cucumber. Unlike traditional Hawaiian poke, the mainland style is typically not pre-marinated, but is instead prepared with sauces on demand. Contemporary poke restaurants are mostly\u2014but not exclusively\u2014fast casual style restaurants where the dish is fully customizable from the base to the marinade on the fish. They may use other seafood but ahi tuna is the most popular.\nThere is a three-day \"I Love Poke\" festival to celebrate the dish and its many variations.\nPoke is similar to other Polynesian fish salads such as ika mata in the Cook Islands, kokoda in Fiji, oka in Samoa and 'ota 'ika in Tonga.\nA very similar dish is the kinilaw of the Philippines, known as the \"Philippine ceviche\". Kinilaw is usually raw diced fish marinated in citrus juice, sour fruits, or vinegar with extracts from mangrove bark or fruits (and sometimes coconut milk). It is indigenous to the islands, with traces recovered from archaeological sites dated to the 10th to 13th centuries AD. This process can also be applied to other seafood and lightly blanched or grilled meat (the latter being generally differentiated as kilawin). The dish was introduced to Guam during the Spanish colonial period, resulting in the derivative Chamorro dish of kelaguen.\nThe Ilocano dish poqui poqui of the Philippines also likely derived its name from poke, after the influx of Ilocano sugarcane workers to Hawaii during the American colonization of the Philippines. However, they are very different dishes, with poqui poqui being a scrambled egg dish with grilled eggplants and tomatoes.\nRaw fish dishes similar to poke that are often served in Europe are fish carpaccio and fish tartare. Also similar to poke are Korean hoe-deopbap, marinated raw tuna served over rice, and Peruvian ceviche. Japanese sashimi also consists of raw seafood; other similar Japanese dishes are zuke don, a donburi dish topped with cured fish (usually tuna or salmon) along with avocado topped with furikake, and kaisendon, a more elaborate version served with additional non-fish toppings.\nBuddha bowl\nSam Choy\nCuisine of Hawaii\nCrudo\nHoe\nKinilaw\nList of hors d'oeuvre\nList of raw fish dishes\nList of salads\n'Ota 'ika\nTataki\nSingju\nYusheng\nMatt Dean Pettit (10 April 2018).

Poke /po\u028a\u02c8ke\u026a/ (Hawaiian for \"to slice\" or \"cut crosswise into pieces\"; sometimes stylized 'pok\u00e9' to aid pronunciation) is diced raw fish served either as an appetizer or a main course and is one of the main dishes of Native Hawaiian cuisine. Traditional forms are aku (skipjack tuna) and he\u02bbe (octopus). He\u02bbe (octopus) poke is usually called by its Japanese name tako pok\u00e9/poki, except in places like the island of Ni\u02bbihau where the Hawaiian language is spoken. Increasingly popular ahi poke is made with yellowfin tuna. Adaptations may feature raw salmon or various shellfish as a main ingredient served raw with the common poke seasonings. Poke differs from other raw fish dishes like ceviche, kinilaw or umai in that it does not use citrus fruits as a curing agent.\nThe traditional Hawaiian poke consists of fish that has been gutted, skinned, and deboned. It is served with traditional condiments such as sea salt, candlenut, seaweed, and limu.\nAccording to the food historian Rachel Laudan, the present form of poke became popular around the 1970s. It used skinned, deboned, and filleted raw fish served with Hawaiian salt, seaweed, and roasted, ground candlenut meat. This form of poke is still common in the Hawaiian islands.\nBeginning around 2012, poke became increasingly popular in North America. From 2014 to mid-2016, \"the number of Hawaiian restaurants on Foursquare, which includes those that serve poke,\" doubled, going from 342 to 700. These restaurants serve both traditional and modern versions of the dish. The modern version is sometimes called pok\u00e9 bowl, and has the ingredients arranged in a grouped way rather than mixed. Variations may include avocado, ponzu sauce, teriyaki sauce, mushrooms, crispy onions, pickled jalape\u00f1o, sriracha sauce, cilantro, pineapple, or cucumber. Unlike traditional Hawaiian poke, the mainland style is typically not pre-marinated, but is instead prepared with sauces on demand. Contemporary poke restaurants are mostly\u2014but not exclusively\u2014fast casual style restaurants where the dish is fully customizable from the base to the marinade on the fish. They may use other seafood but ahi tuna is the most popular.\nThere is a three-day \"I Love Poke\" festival to celebrate the dish and its many variations.\nPoke is similar to other Polynesian fish salads such as ika mata in the Cook Islands, kokoda in Fiji, oka in Samoa and 'ota 'ika in Tonga.\nA very similar dish is the kinilaw of the Philippines, known as the \"Philippine ceviche\". Kinilaw is usually raw diced fish marinated in citrus juice, sour fruits, or vinegar with extracts from mangrove bark or fruits (and sometimes coconut milk). It is indigenous to the islands, with traces recovered from archaeological sites dated to the 10th to 13th centuries AD. This process can also be applied to other seafood and lightly blanched or grilled meat (the latter being generally differentiated as kilawin). The dish was introduced to Guam during the Spanish colonial period, resulting in the derivative Chamorro dish of kelaguen.\nThe Ilocano dish poqui poqui of the Philippines also likely derived its name from poke, after the influx of Ilocano sugarcane workers to Hawaii during the American colonization of the Philippines. However, they are very different dishes, with poqui poqui being a scrambled egg dish with grilled eggplants and tomatoes.\nRaw fish dishes similar to poke that are often served in Europe are fish carpaccio and fish tartare. Also similar to poke are Korean hoe-deopbap, marinated raw tuna served over rice, and Peruvian ceviche. Japanese sashimi also consists of raw seafood; other similar Japanese dishes are zuke don, a donburi dish topped with cured fish (usually tuna or salmon) along with avocado topped with furikake, and kaisendon, a more elaborate version served with additional non-fish toppings.\nBuddha bowl\nSam Choy\nCuisine of Hawaii\nCrudo\nHoe\nKinilaw\nList of hors d'oeuvre\nList of raw fish dishes\nList of salads\n'Ota 'ika\nTataki\nSingju\nYusheng\nMatt Dean Pettit (10 April 2018).

An Empire biscuit (Imperial biscuit, Imperial cookie, double biscuit, German biscuit, Belgian biscuit, double shortbread, Empire cookie or biscuit bun) is a sweet biscuit eaten in Scotland, and other Commonwealth countries. It is popular in Northern Ireland, and it is an iconic dish in Winnipeg,\nCanada.\nEmpire biscuit was originally known as the \"Linzer biscuit\", and later as the \"Deutsch biscuit\". With the outbreak of the First World War it was renamed:  in England to Empire biscuit, in Scotland to Belgian biscuit because Belgium had just been invaded, but in Northern Ireland it remains known as the German biscuit or biscuit bun. In Scotland the name now varies depending on the region, with the North-east typically calling it a double shortbread and the West an Empire biscuit. In Northern Ireland it is commonly found with a jam and coconut topping. It is also known as the \"Belgian biscuit\", due to being topped in a similar way to a Belgian bun, which is made of pastry or dough.\nThere also exists a biscuit similar to the Jammie Dodger which is referred to as a Linzer biscuit.\nEmpire biscuits are similar to Viennese whirls.\nKnown as a \"Belgium\" or as a \"Belgian biscuit\" in New Zealand, this type of biscuit gained popularity towards the end of the Great War and is now typically found either in biscuit or slice form. Typically, spiced biscuits are filled with raspberry jam and topped with pink or white icing, with raspberry jelly crystals scattered on top instead of the cherry. These are quite different to the Empire biscuit, which bears more similarity to a NZ 'Shrewsbury'.\nList of shortbread biscuits and cookies\nOther foods renamed for political reasons include:\nLiberty cabbage\nFreedom fries\n\"Traditional Scottish Recipes - Empire Biscuits\". www.rampantscotland.com.\nEdmonds Classics Hachette Livre, 2005. pg. 25\nReview of biscuit on Nice Cup of Tea and a Sit Down",

It has been popular worldwide since the early 20th century, and has been prepared and discussed by many chefs.

The version known in Nice in the late 19th century was a basic combination of tomatoes,  anchovies and olive oil, described as \"simple food for poor people\". Over time,  other fresh and mostly raw ingredients were added to the salad as served in Nice. A 1903 recipe by Henri Heyraud in a book called La Cuisine \u00e0 Nice included tomatoes, anchovies, artichokes, olive oil, red peppers and black olives, but excluded tuna and lettuce. The dressing included olive oil,  vinegar,  mustard and fines herbes.\nFormer Nice mayor and cookbook author Jacques M\u00e9decin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen called for the salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: \"never, never, I beg you, include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade ni\u00e7oise.\" M\u00e9decin wrote that the salad should be made \"predominantly of tomatoes\" which should be \"salted three times and moistened with olive oil\". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna,  but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, M\u00e9decin believed that salade ni\u00e7oise \"was a product of the sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi.\" M\u00e9decin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad,  commenting, \"As the various ingredients that go into salade ni\u00e7oise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl.\"\nAn organization called Cercle de la Capelina d\u2019Or, led for many years by Ren\u00e9e Graglia until her death in 2013, continues to protest against deviation from traditional local recipes. The group, which certifies restaurants in Nice, sticks with  M\u00e9decin's standards. They reject commonly included ingredients such as green beans and potatoes, as well as innovations such as including sweet corn, mayonnaise, shallots and lemon.\nIn 2016, French Michelin-starred chef H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze posted a salade ni\u00e7oise recipe on Facebook that included cooked potatoes and green beans. According to journalist Mathilde Fr\u00e9nois, the reaction on Facebook was quick and hostile from the \"purists\". Darroze's version was called \"a massacre of the recipe\", a \"sacrilege\", and a violation of the \"ancestral traditions\" of the salad. She was warned that it is \"dangerous to innovate\".\nThe question of the proper ingredients appropriate for a salade ni\u00e7oise has long been the subject of debate and even controversy. The British cook Nigella Lawson observed \"Everyone seems to have a very strong opinion as to what should or should not go into a Salade Ni\u00e7oise\". Chef and cookbook author Auguste Escoffier (1846\u20131935), born in Villeneuve-Loubet near Nice, added potatoes and green beans, an innovation that remains controversial as a \"questionable idea\" a century later.\nSalade ni\u00e7oise has been known in the United States since at least the 1920s, when a cookbook for hotel chefs included two variations. The first was vegetarian,  was dressed with mayonnaise, and included lettuce, tomatoes,  potatoes, stringless beans and pimento-stuffed olives, while the second version was a composed salad,  including the same ingredients, plus anchovies.\nThe dish was included in the 1936 cookbook L'Art culinaire moderne by Henri-Paul Pellaprat, which was first translated for American cooks in 1966 as Modern French Culinary Art. His version included cold cooked potatoes and cold cooked green beans.\nA 1941 U.S. version by chef Louis Diat of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel included the anchovies, was dressed with vinaigrette, and added capers.\nThe highly influential 1961 American cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, included a recipe that incorporated a potato salad, green beans, both tuna and anchovies and a vinaigrette dressing. Co-author Julia Child later demonstrated the recipe on her television show, The French Chef, in 1970.\nA recipe was included in Prosper Montagn\u00e9's Larousse Gastronomique in 1938. It called for \"equal parts diced potatoes and French beans. Season with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix with anchovy fillets, olives and capers. Garnish with quartered tomatoes.\"\nFrench chef Paul Bocuse included a vegetarian version of the salad, garnished with chopped onion and chervil, in the 1977 English translation of his cookbook.\nA 1979 variation by Pierre Franey is called Salade Ni\u00e7oise aux Poires d'Avocat.

It is served with traditional condiments such as sea salt, candlenut, seaweed, and limu.\nAccording to the food historian Rachel Laudan, the present form of poke became popular around the 1970s. It used skinned, deboned, and filleted raw fish served with Hawaiian salt, seaweed, and roasted, ground candlenut meat. This form of poke is still common in the Hawaiian islands.\nBeginning around 2012, poke became increasingly popular in North America. From 2014 to mid-2016, \"the number of Hawaiian restaurants on Foursquare, which includes those that serve poke,\" doubled, going from 342 to 700. These restaurants serve both traditional and modern versions of the dish. The modern version is sometimes called pok\u00e9 bowl, and has the ingredients arranged in a grouped way rather than mixed. Variations may include avocado, ponzu sauce, teriyaki sauce, mushrooms, crispy onions, pickled jalape\u00f1o, sriracha sauce, cilantro, pineapple, or cucumber. Unlike traditional Hawaiian poke, the mainland style is typically not pre-marinated, but is instead prepared with sauces on demand. Contemporary poke restaurants are mostly\u2014but not exclusively\u2014fast casual style restaurants where the dish is fully customizable from the base to the marinade on the fish. They may use other seafood but ahi tuna is the most popular.\nThere is a three-day \"I Love Poke\" festival to celebrate the dish and its many variations.\nPoke is similar to other Polynesian fish salads such as ika mata in the Cook Islands, kokoda in Fiji, oka in Samoa and 'ota 'ika in Tonga.\nA very similar dish is the kinilaw of the Philippines, known as the \"Philippine ceviche\". Kinilaw is usually raw diced fish marinated in citrus juice, sour fruits, or vinegar with extracts from mangrove bark or fruits (and sometimes coconut milk). It is indigenous to the islands, with traces recovered from archaeological sites dated to the 10th to 13th centuries AD. This process can also be applied to other seafood and lightly blanched or grilled meat (the latter being generally differentiated as kilawin). The dish was introduced to Guam during the Spanish colonial period, resulting in the derivative Chamorro dish of kelaguen.\nThe Ilocano dish poqui poqui of the Philippines also likely derived its name from poke, after the influx of Ilocano sugarcane workers to Hawaii during the American colonization of the Philippines. However, they are very different dishes, with poqui poqui being a scrambled egg dish with grilled eggplants and tomatoes.\nRaw fish dishes similar to poke that are often served in Europe are fish carpaccio and fish tartare. Also similar to poke are Korean hoe-deopbap, marinated raw tuna served over rice, and Peruvian ceviche. Japanese sashimi also consists of raw seafood; other similar Japanese dishes are zuke don, a donburi dish topped with cured fish (usually tuna or salmon) along with avocado topped with furikake, and kaisendon, a more elaborate version served with additional non-fish toppings.\nBuddha bowl\nSam Choy\nCuisine of Hawaii\nCrudo\nHoe\nKinilaw\nList of hors d'oeuvre\nList of raw fish dishes\nList of salads\n'Ota 'ika\nTataki\nSingju\nYusheng\nMatt Dean Pettit (10 April 2018).

Olivier salad (Russian: \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442 \u041e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044c\u0435, tr. salat Olivye) is a traditional salad dish in Russian cuisine, which is also popular in other post-Soviet countries and around the world. In different modern recipes, it is usually made with diced boiled potatoes, carrots, brined dill pickles (or cucumber), green peas, eggs, celeriac, onions, diced boiled chicken or bologna sausage (sometimes ham or hot dogs), and tart apples, with salt, pepper, and mustard added to enhance flavor, dressed with mayonnaise. In many countries, the dish is commonly referred to as Russian salad. A variation called Stolichny salad (Russian: \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442 \"\u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439\", \"capital city salad\") exists, and is also popular in the Russian cuisine.\nIn Russia and other post-Soviet states, as well as in Russophone communities worldwide, the salad has become one of the main dishes on zakuski tables served during New Year's Eve (\"Novy God\") celebrations.\nThe original version of the salad was invented in the 1860s by a cook of Belgian origin, Lucien Olivier, the chef of the Hermitage, one of Moscow's most celebrated restaurants. Olivier's salad quickly became immensely popular with Hermitage regulars, and became the restaurant's signature dish.\nThe exact recipe\u2014particularly that of the dressing\u2014was a zealously guarded secret, but it is known that the salad contained grouse, veal tongue, caviar, lettuce, crayfish tails, capers, and smoked duck, although it is possible that the recipe was varied seasonally. The original Olivier dressing was a type of mayonnaise, made with French wine vinegar, mustard, and Proven\u00e7al olive oil; its exact recipe, however, remains unknown.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, one of Olivier's sous-chefs, Ivan Ivanov, attempted to steal the recipe. While preparing the dressing one evening in solitude, as was his custom, Olivier was suddenly called away. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Ivanov sneaked into Olivier's private kitchen and observed his mise en place, which allowed him to make reasonable assumptions about the recipe of Olivier's famed dressing. Ivanov then left Olivier's employ and went to work as a chef for Moskva, a somewhat inferior restaurant, where he began to serve a suspiciously similar salad under the name \"metropolitan salad\" (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439, tr. Stolichny). It was reported by the gourmands of the time, however, that the dressing on the \"Stolichny\" salad was of a lower quality than Olivier's, meaning that it was \"missing something.\"\nLater, Ivanov sold the recipe for the salad to various publishing houses, which further contributed to its popularization. Due to the closure of the Hermitage restaurant in 1905, and the Olivier family's subsequent departure from Russia, the salad could now be referred to as \"Olivier.\"\nOne of the first printed recipes for Olivier salad, by Aleksandrova, appearing in 1894, called for half a hazel grouse, two potatoes, one small cucumber (or a large cornichon), 3\u20134 lettuce leaves, 3 large crayfish tails, 1/4 cup cubed aspic, 1 teaspoon of capers, 3\u20135 olives, and 11\u20442 tablespoon Proven\u00e7al dressing (mayonnaise).\nAs often happens with gourmet recipes which become popular, the ingredients which were rare, expensive, seasonal, or difficult to prepare were gradually replaced with cheaper and more readily available foods.\nToday's popular version of Olivier salad\u2014containing boiled potatoes, dill pickles, peas, eggs, carrots, and boiled beef/chicken or bologna, dressed with mayonnaise\u2014is a version of Ivanov's Stolichny salad, and only faintly resembles Olivier's original creation. This version was a staple of any Soviet holiday dinner, especially of a Novy God (New Year's Eve) dinner (to the extent that its presence was considered on a par with Soviet Champagne or mandarin oranges), due to availability of components in winter. Even though more exotic foods are widely available in Russia now, its popularity has hardly diminished: this salad was and maybe still is the most traditional dish for the home New Year celebration for Russian people.\nFestive Russian and post-Soviet states' homemade versions are traditionally at the cook's whim. While some of the ingredients are considered to be basic and essential, others are either favoured or dismissed as a threat to supposed authenticity.\nThe biggest Olivier salad, weighing 1841 kg, was prepared in December 2012 in Orenburg.\nEuropean cafes and delicatessens often provide an entire range of Olivier-style salads. Additionally, cafeterias, convenience stores, and truck stops sell a number of sub-par factory packaged or locally made versions, mostly extremely simple, using basic ingredients with cheap mayonnaise-like dressing.\nIn Serbia Olivier salad is called russian salad",

Seafood pizza is pizza prepared with seafood as a primary ingredient. Many types of seafood ingredients in fresh, frozen or canned forms may be used on seafood pizza. Some retail pizza chains, as well as smaller restaurants, offer seafood pizzas to consumers.\n\nFrutti di Mare is an Italian type of pizza that may be served with scampi, mussels or squid. It typically lacks cheese, with the seafood being served atop a tomato sauce.\nA variety of seafood pizza is pizza pescatore (fisherman's pizza), which is prepared with mussels and squid.\n\nDomino's Pizza offers a seafood pizza in Vietnam, which (as of December 2012) was the company's \"best-selling product in Vietnam\".\nPizza Hut has offered a seafood pizza in Malaysia and India called \"Seafood symphony\". The Indian Pizza Hut version was prepared with fresh seafood from the waters of Kochi, India.\nBarleycorn Pizza in Owego, New York, developed a specialty seafood pizza prepared with garlic, crab legs, shrimp and scallops.\nBenedetti's Pizza in Manzanillo, Mexico, specializes in seafood pizza, including those prepared with anchovy and smoked oysters.\nCiro's Restaurant & Lounge in Mahopac, New York, developed a seafood pizza prepared with clams, shrimp, mussels and scungilli.\nFrank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana in New Haven, Connecticut, is well known for its white clam pizza, featuring fresh littleneck clams.\nKo Olina's Pizza Corner restaurant in Kapolei, Hawaii, developed a pizza called \"Original Hawaiian Poke Pizza\", which uses poke, a raw seafood salad, on pizza. The poke is placed atop the pizza after the pizza has been cooked. Another dish the restaurant serves is a seafood pizza that includes lobster cream sauce in its preparation.\nThe world's most expensive pizza listed by Guinness World Records is a 12-inch (30\u00a0cm) seafood pizza called the \"C6\" that is prepared at Steveston Pizza Co. restaurant in Steveston, British Columbia (in the Metro Vancouver area) which costs C$850. The pizza includes lobster, caviar, tiger prawns and smoked salmon. Each slice is worth C$85, because it is divided into 10 slices. It has to be pre-ordered one day in advance. The title for world's most expensive pizza was previously held by a C$178 pizza prepared with white truffle by Gordon Ramsay. As of September 2014, Guinness World Records still lists the Gordon Ramsay pizza on their website.\nThere are several instances of more expensive pizzas, such as the US$4,200 \u201cPizza Royale 007\" at Haggis restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland, which has caviar, lobster and is topped with 24-carat gold leaf, and the US$1,000 caviar pizza made by Nino's Bellissima pizzeria in New York City, New York.

The Food Display Machine Corporation was located at 500 North Dearborn Street in Chicago. Its president was H. Adams. In the mid-1920s, through advertisements in Popular Mechanics magazine and perhaps other means as well, these machines were marketed as a way to start a small business. The machine\u2019s manual has 3 parts:\nSeven Proven Business Plans for Operating a Successful BROWN BOBBY Business\nHow to get the Best Results from your BROWN BOBBY Machine\nRecipes that Whet the Buying Appetite\nThe seven business plans described are:\nSelling Direct to Homes\nGetting the Restaurant and Drug Store Business\nGetting the Grocery Business\nWindow Demonstrating and Sampling\nGetting the Student Trade\nSelling Through Salesmen\nRunning a BROWN BOBBY Store of your own\nSome of the suggested locations for selling included candy stores, theatres, chain stores, bowling alleys, cigar stores, railway stations, dance halls, waiting rooms, garages, filling stations, general stores, and soft drink parlors.\nOne could also obtain boxes and bags from the company for packaging the doughnuts. The machines are no longer manufactured as the Food Display Machine Corporation has long been out of business. According to the Annual Report of the Federal Trade Commission for 1937 the company was issued a Cease and Desist order for misrepresenting possible or maximum earnings for its potato chip machines.\nThe Brown Bobby machine resembled and operated similar to a waffle iron. Its surfaces were made of aluminium and were prepared for baking by coating with paraffin, though users today would most often use cooking spray. The machine had a high (600 watt/surfaces connected in parallel) and a low (300 watt/surfaces connected in series) setting. Cooking was done on the high setting, the low setting was for allowing the machine to remain idle. Machines were available as either a single (aka Brown Bobby Junior) for US$52 or as two machines riveted together into a single unit for US$100. Since these machines are no longer manufactured they are prized by their owners and often handed down to subsequent generations to continue a tradition of Brown Bobby making, especially during the holidays.\nThe Brown Bobby manual included 10 recipes for doughnuts, 4 icing recipes and a number of prepared doughnut mixes were also available. Recipes included Plain, Wholewheat, Bran, Spice, Nut, Tutti-Frutti, Chocolate and Oatmeal. The doughnuts were touted as \u201cgreaseless\u201d because they were not deep-fried, but as the included recipe indicates, there was an amount of fat in the doughnut itself.\nList of doughnut varieties\nList of fried dough varieties\nList of breakfast foods\n\u00a0Food portal\n\"Annual Report of the Federal Trade Commission for 1937\" (PDF).

Bananas Foster is an American dessert that originated in New Orleans made with cooked bananas served in a butter, brown sugar and rum sauce. The caramelized liquor-based sauce is often prepared using a cooking technique called flamb\u00e9. This dessert can be served with vanilla ice cream or as a cr\u00eape filling, but it may also be eaten on its own. Cinnamon and nutmeg may be added as seasoning.\nThough many think the dish was created at the restaurant Brennan's in New Orleans, Louisiana, it actually got its start a few years earlier in Owen Brennan's Vieux Carr\u00e9 restaurant. In 1951, Ella Brennan and the restaurant's chef Paul Blang\u00e9 worked together to modify a dish made by Ella's mother in the Brennan family home. At this time New Orleans was a major hub for the import of bananas from South America.

There are many variations, but the classic banana split is made with three scoops of ice cream (one each of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry).

The original banana split was made with three scoops of different flavored ice creams, topped with fruits, and served over a banana that was split vertically down the middle. The original recipe used strawberries, raspberries and crushed pineapple with marshmallow syrup, chopped nuts, and pitted black cherries. The banana split is traditionally served in an elongated glass dish called a \"boat\".\nStrickler's marshmallow sauce is no longer used as a topping. The traditional toppings used in today's banana split include pineapple, strawberry and chocolate sauce, whipped cream, nuts, and cherries. Caramel sauce, on the other hand, is a non-traditional topping used in later variations of the classic banana split.\nVariations on the classic may use grilled bananas, experiment with different flavors of ice cream such as coconut or coffee, or sauces like salted caramel and warm butterscotch.\nCold beverages and ice cream were a novelty in the mid-1800s when soda fountains began selling ice cream concoctions. A popular recipe published in 1907 called for a lengthwise split banana, two scoops of ice cream at each end and a spoon of whipped cream in between with maraschino cherry on top, with one end covered with chopped mixed nuts and another with chopped mixed fruits. The Spatula Soda Water Guide published in 1919 contained recipes for 25 banana split varieties. \nThe origin of the banana split is controversial, but most historians believe it was first created in 1904 by an optometrist in Latrobe, Pennsylvania named David \"Doc\" Strickler. Strickler was inspired by the fruit laden sundaes he saw while vacationing in Atlantic City in the summer of 1904, and aspired to create something similar when he returned to Latrobe using the banana fruit, which, in those days, was shipped to Pennsylvania by way of New Orleans. The sundae he concocted originally cost 10 cents, twice the price of other sundaes, and caught on with students of nearby Saint Vincent College. News of a new variety of sundae quickly spread by word-of-mouth and through correspondence and soon progressed far beyond Latrobe. Strickler went on to buy the pharmacy, naming it Strickler's Pharmacy, while keeping his office on a top floor. \nWilmington, Ohio, also claims an early connection dating to 1907 when Ernest \"Doc\" Hazard created a dessert in hopes of attracting students from Wilmington College to his shop during the slow days of winter. The dessert he came up with was the banana split: three scoops of ice cream served between the two halves of a split banana, topped with chocolate, strawberry and pineapple sauces, whipped cream, maraschino cherries and nuts. \nHowever, most historians believe the evidence for Strickler's 1904 debut is more convincing, and, in 2004, the National Ice Cream Retailers Association (NICRA) certified the city of Latrobe, Pennsylvania as the birthplace of the banana split. Both towns hold an annual festival in honor of the dessert. \nLatrobe and Wilmington are not the only towns to claim the distinction of inventing the banana split. In Boston it is said the dessert was created at the Butler Department Store by the head soda jerk who, in 1905, served a banana split with two scoops of vanilla ice cream, topped with peaches, walnuts and pistachios. Davenport, Iowa claims it was invented by a local Davenport confectioner in 1906, and similar claims have been made by Columbus, Ohio, where the banana split is said to have been created by Letty Lally when a customer at Foeller's Drug Store asked for \"something different.\" (Food writer Mike Turback considers Lally's creation the first banana royale, a sundae made with banana slices.) The lack of evidence presents an obstacle to proving any of these claims.\nWalgreens is credited with spreading the popularity of the banana split. The early drug stores operated by Charles Rudolph Walgreen in the Chicago area adopted the banana split as a signature dessert. Fountains in the stores proved to be a draw, attracting customers who might otherwise have been just as satisfied having their prescriptions filled at some other drug store in the neighborhood.\nThe banana split pie was created by Janet Winquest, a 16-year-old resident of Holdrege, Nebraska. In 1952, she won a $3,000 prize in Pillsbury's Grand National Recipe and Baking Contest for the recipe.\nLouis Prima played a song called \"Banana Split for My Baby\" at the Casbar Lounge of the Sahara Hotel in 1956.\nList of banana dishes\n\"All-American Banana Split Recipe\".

Teh tarik (literally \"pulled tea\") is a popular hot milk tea beverage most commonly found in restaurants, outdoor stalls, mamaks and kopitiams within the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. Its name is derived from the pouring process of \"pulling\" the drink during preparation. It is made from a strong brew of black tea blended with condensed milk. It is the national drink of Malaysia.\nTeh tarik is formed by two languages: \"Teh\" which means \"tea\" and \"tarik\" which means \"pulled\". The word \"Teh\" for tea originates from Hokkien word \u8336 t\u00ea for tea, the word \"Tarik\" for pulled originates from Malay.\nThe origins of teh tarik can be traced to Indian Muslim immigrants in the Malay Peninsula who set up drink stalls at the entrance of rubber plantations after World War II to serve the workers there. Since colonial times, teh tarik has been a popular Malaysian Indian cuisine for many in British Malaya and Singapore. Traditionally, teh tarik has been seen served with the Roti canai which is a popular breakfast set among Malaysians.\nAn element of showmanship exists in the preparation of teh tarik. The ability to drag a long stream of tea above the heads of the patrons without giving them a shower is an amusing novelty for the locals and tourists alike. In Malaysia, there are occasions where teh tarik brewers gather for competitions and performances to show their skills. Teh tarik has become recognised along with nasi lemak as part of the food and beverage heritage of Malaysia by the Malaysian government ministry.\nTeh Ais is tea sweetened with condensed milk that is simply served in a glass with ice cubes. It may also be known as Teh Tarik Ping or Teh Tarik Ais with the tarik treatment.\nTeh Tarik Madu is teh tarik blended with honey as part of its preparation, which is usually served cold.\nTeh halia, teh tarik flavoured with ginger.\nTeh Madras, a variant popular in Sabah and Labuan, is made with frothed milky tea layered on top of hot milk.\nTeh-C is tea made with unsweetened evaporated milk, unlike the traditional teh tarik which is made with sweetened condensed milk. Vendors however will add sugar to Teh-C unless specifically asked not to. The Malay word for nil or zero, kosong, is used to indicate that the drinker does not want their beverage to be sweetened. The \u2018C\u2019 stands for \u2018Carnation\u2019, a popular brand of evaporated milk. A three layered tea variation of the drink called Teh C Peng Special are available and sold in most kopitiams, consisting of black tea, milk and palm sugar syrup from the top to bottom layer respectively. Teh C' Ais is the iced drink version of it with ice cubes.\nTeh-O refers to black tea without any addition of dairy products or creamers entirely, hence the \u2018O\u2019 stands for \"original\". Like Teh-C, sugar is usually added except when Teh-O kosong is specified, where once again sugar is omitted. Teh O' Ais is the iced drink version of it with ice cubes.\nKopi Tarik is local coffee, dark roasted with margarine and sugar, which is sweetened with condensed milk and pulled to froth it up. Drinks made with Milo and Nescafe may also be served with the tarik treatment by vendors which specialise in teh tarik.\nThai Tea\nHong Kong-style Milk Tea\nBubble Tea\nMasala Chai\nBonny Tan (2013). \"Teh tarik\".

Corzetti or Croxetti (Ligurian:\u00a0[kur'zet\u02d1i] or [kru'\u0292et\u02d1i]) are a kind of pasta typical of the Ligurian cuisine of north-west Italy, and traditional also in the area of Novi Ligure just across the border with Piedmont in the Province of Alessandria. Corzetti originated in Liguria, in Northern Italy along the border with France, during the middle ages. The name itself derives from a 14th century Genoan coin, the corzetto.\nThere are different kinds of corzetti. Those from the Val Polcevera, one of the principal valleys of the area of Genoa are made in \"figure of eight\" shape. Elsewhere  corzetti stamp\u00e6 ([kur'zet\u02d1i sta\u014b\u02c8p\u025b\u02d0], \"pressed\" or \"stamped\" corzetti) are found. These are small, thin rounds of pasta that are given an embossed decoration using a special wooden hand-tool. The embossing helps the pasta to hold its sauce better. A pasta with a similar name can also be found in neighbouring Piedmont, but its shape is more akin to that of orecchiette.\nCorzetti are still produced in small batches near Genoa. In the past they were made by local peasants and used by aristocratic families as a display of wealth and status.\nSheets of pasta are stamped and cut into circles approximately 4 centimetres (1+1\u20442 inches) in diameter from flat pasta sheets with a mold to create the distinctive patterns. The combination mold/cutter may be made of hand-carved wood or a bronze die.  The stamping may be done by hand or by machine, with the hand-stamped versions being more elaborate.  The detail forms ridges that allow sauce to cling and add flavor.\nThe pasta typically has patterns on both sides, with an intricate design on one side and a simpler pattern on the other. Whereas they once featured a family coat of arms, the fancier side now features a regional coat of arms or the maker's trademark.

It may also be prepared as a porridge which is called a \"jham-thoo\" which is usually sweet and nutty and prepared with tibetan cheese, butter, tea and sugar. Tsampa is also prepared in a congee with lamb or yak stock to make a congee which is called \"tsam-thug\".

Tsampa or Tsamba (Tibetan: \u0f62\u0fa9\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f0b, Wylie: rtsam pa; Nepali: \u0938\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092a\u093e; Chinese: \u7ccc\u7c91; pinyin: z\u0101nb\u0101) is a Tibetan and Himalayan staple foodstuff, particularly prominent in the central part of the region. It is glutinous meal made from roasted flour, usually barley flour and sometimes also wheat flour. It is usually mixed with the salty Tibetan butter tea. It is also eaten in Turkestan and Mongolia, where it is known as zamba.\nBesides constituting a substantial, arguably predominant part of the Tibetan diet, its prominence also derives from the tradition of throwing pinches of tsampa in the air during many Buddhist rituals. It is believed that tsampa-throwing actually predates Buddhist beliefs in the area and was originally used as an offering to animistic gods to request their protection. The tradition was consequently incorporated into Buddhism as a \"mark of joy and celebration\" used at celebratory occasions such as marriages and birthdays. Today it is particularly known in that regard for its use in New Year celebrations, where it is accompanied by chanted verses expressing the desire for good luck in the forthcoming year, for both oneself and others. Tsampa-throwing also occurs at most Buddhist funerals, where the action is intended to release the soul of the deceased.\nTsampa is used in a number of other ways. Mashes of tsampa and cumin are sometimes applied to toothaches or other sore spots. Tsampa is also known among Tibetan sportsmen for its ability to provide rapid energy boosts; the roasting of the flour breaks it down to an easily digestible state, allowing the calories therein to be quickly incorporated by the body.\nReflecting its foundational role in Tibetan culture, \"Tsampa\" is also the name of a Tibetan typeface.\nThe phrase \"tsampa-eater\" was used to promote a unified Tibetan identity. Whereas Tibetans speak various dialects, worship in different sects, and live in different regions, all Tibetans were thought to eat tsampa. In 1957, the India-based Tibet Mirror addressed a letter to \"all tsampa-eaters\", encouraging them to participate in what would become the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion. Recently, with the rise of the Tibetan diaspora, less emphasis has been placed on tsampa and more emphasis on Tibetan Buddhism in constructing a unified Tibetan identity.\nBrenntar\u00a0\u2013  Traditional Swabian staple foodstuff similar to Tsampa.\nBrose\nChatang\nGundain\nGyabrag\nGofio\nHardtack\nKama (food)\nMisutgaru\nParched grain\nTibetan cuisine\nList of porridges\nList of Tibetan dishes\nMigot, Andr\u00e9.

Beignet has been borrowed into English via French. \nOther cognates include Old High German bungo (\u201cswelling, tuber\u201d), German bunge, Dutch bonk (\u201clump, clump\u201d), Gaulish *bunia, Scottish Gaelic bonnach (\u201ccake, biscuit\u201d).\nDough fritters are known in Mediterranean cuisine from the work of Cato the Elder who included a recipe with the name \"balloons\" in his book De Agri Cultura, which was written in the second century BC. In that recipe, flour and cheese balls were fried and served with a spread made of honey and poppy seeds.\nThe society following the Roman one that consumed bu\u00f1uelos was the Moorish. Its citizens, people of humble means, who inhabited the southern territories of the Iberian Peninsula and occupied low-level jobs, also served as street vendors selling bu\u00f1uelos. In Seville and Granada, honey-fried bu\u00f1uelos covered in honey were typical dessert. On the other hand, this specialty was adopted by the gypsies after the Moorish expulsion and perpetuated until today.\nA 19th century recipe from California, described as pasta de freir (dough to fry), is made by folding whipped egg whites into a mixture of flour, water, sugar, oil and orange blossom water. This is used as a batter to fry apples or other fruit. A variation called suspiros de monjas (nun's sighs) includes butter and egg yolks. Bu\u00f1uelos de Valparaiso are garnished with walnuts and sherry or maraschino flavored simple syrup.\nIn Spain, the bu\u00f1uelos are a dessert and snack typical in many autonomous communities and, especially, during their regional holidays. Each territory incorporates its own ingredients and its own tradition. One of the best known is the wind bu\u00f1uelo, a species of fritter.\nIn Catalonia, they are consumed mostly during Lent. The most famous are those of wind, cream and Brunyols de l'Empord\u00e0. They are usually eaten as a snack or to accompany coffee after lunch.\nIn Valencia, the highest consumption is concentrated in festivities such as Fallas de Valencia, where pumpkin bu\u00f1uelos are made.\nIn the Balearic Islands, there are sweet fritters for different parties of the year (Las V\u00edrgenes, Todos los Santos, Lent, etc.) and, depending on the occasion, they can contain potato or sweet potato, Mah\u00f3n cheese, dried figs, etc.\nIn Madrid and Andalusia, they are consumed with special assiduity during the Festival of Saints, during which it was customary for women to prepare them in the houses and sell them or give them to neighbors, especially in the  villages.\nIn some regions of Spain, bu\u00f1uelos find a strong competitor in churros, which are increasingly widespread at parties normally associated with bu\u00f1uelos. On the other hand, in Catalonia, churros are primarily consumed by tourists; Catalans prefer the xuixos or chuchos in churrer\u00edas or the bu\u00f1uelos in their multiple forms in bakeries or in houses.\nIn Colombia they are made with a small curd white cheese and formed into doughy balls then fried golden brown. It is a traditional Christmas dish, served along with natillas and manjar blanco.\nIn Cuba they are traditionally twisted in a figure 8 and covered in an anise caramel. The dough contains cassava and malanga.\nIn the Dominican Republic, bu\u00f1uelos are rolled into balls from a dough made of cassava (called yuca) and eggs. They are then covered in a cinnamon sugar syrup, often using coconut milk instead of water.\nIn Nicaragua, bu\u00f1uelos are made from cassava, eggs, and white grating cheese. The bu\u00f1uelos are rolled into balls and deep fried. They are served alongside a syrup made of sugar, water, cinnamon sticks, and cloves. They are eaten year-round, and are a typical side dish or snack served during holidays.\nIn the Philippines, bu\u00f1uelos (also called bunwelos, bunuelos, binowilos, etc.) can be shaped like a ball, a pancake, a cylinder, or even a doughnut. They are commonly eaten with tsokolate, the local hot chocolate drink. There are also unique local variants of bu\u00f1uelos, the most common is cascaron (also bitsu-bitsu) which is made with ground glutinous rice (galapong) rather than regular flour. Another variant is bunwelos na saging, which is made with mashed bananas added into the mixture, similar to maruya, a",

                "description": "Zalabiyeh (Arabic: ) also known as Mutabaqa is a fritter or doughnut found in several cuisines across the Middle East and West Asia. The fritter version, similar to jalebi and funnel cake, is made from a semi-thin batter of wheat flour which is poured into hot oil and deep-fried. The earliest known recipe for the dish comes from a 10th-century Arabic cookbook and is made by pouring the batter through a coconut shell. Zalabiyeh is also the Arabic language term used by Mizrahi Jews for a deep-fried yeast dough, often topped with either honey or syrup, and known as burmuelos in Ladino.",

The earliest known recipes for zalabiya comes from the 10th century Arabic cookbook Kitab al-Tabikh. In the ancient Baghdadi recipe, the dough was poured through a coconut shell. This style of fritter is similar to the Indian jelabi and a 16th-century recipe from German cuisine for strauben made using a funnel. \nAmong Yemenite Jews, the zalabiyeh was a treat eaten especially during the winter months. In Yemen, the zalabiyeh was fried in a soapstone pot lined with oil about 1 cm. deep, in which oil and sometimes honey was mixed.\nZalabiyeh are commonly eaten by Muslims during the month of Ramadan, and during the Diwali celebrations for Hindus and Christian communities during Advent and Easter, and by Sephardic Jews for Hanukkah.\nAccording to 2 Samuel 13:8\u201310 King David's daughter prepared fritters (Hebrew: \u05dc\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea\u200e) for her step-brother Amnon. By the 2nd-century CE, the name of the fritter had taken on the name s\u016bf\u011fen\u012bn (Hebrew: \u05e1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e4\u05b0\u05d2\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df\u200e) in Mishnaic Hebrew, a word derived from its sponge-like texture with alveolar holes.\nZalabiyeh (or zelebi) are a traditional sufgan (\"spongy dough\") for Persian Jews.\nThe fritter is very common in the Indian subcontinent, in countries such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, although made differently to that of the Middle Eastern and North African variety. In many Middle Eastern and North African countries, such as Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia, Algeria, Ethiopia, Egypt and also in Israel, they resemble spongy-cakes fried in oil.\nIn Iran, where it is known as zolbiya, the sweet was traditionally given to the poor during Ramadan. There are several 13th century recipes of the sweet, the most accepted being mentioned in a cookbook by Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi. \nIn Iraq in the 20th-century, starch (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0634\u0627\u200e) was a basic ingredient in their zalabiyeh, topped with sugar. In North Africa, zalabiyeh was often made with yoghurt added to the dry ingredients.\nThey are known as zlebia in Tunisian cuisine, jalebie in the Philippines, z\u00fclbiya in Azerbaijan and jilapi in India.\nSufganiyah\nJalebi\nBrauer, E.

It is a sweetened condensed milk made by boiling milk on low heat until the milk is reduced by half. In North India, a similar dish goes by the name rabri.\nIt is often made on Hindu festivals such as Kali Chaudas and Bhaubeej (Bhai Dooj).\nDifferent styles of basundi are also prepared, such as sitaphal (custard apple) basundi and angoor basundi (basundi with smaller kinds of rasgullas).\nBasundi can be served hot, warm or chilled. It is often served with puris (fried Indian flatbread).\nThis milk that is flavored with cardamom powder and saffron basundi varies as per the quantity of saffron. Add less for mild colour. The addition of condensed milk gives a nice flavour and wealth to basundi.\nMilk - Milk provides daily allowance of Calcium. The calcium in milk protects teeth and bones.Protein is another key nutrient which milk is rich in - 8.6g.\nAlmonds - Almonds are rich in B complex vitamins such as Vitamin B1, Vitamin B3, Thiamine, Niacine and Folate which plays an important role in brain development.\n\nNarsobawadi Basundi is a variant from Narsobawadi, Maharashtra.

The milk becomes thick and changes colour becomes off white. The sugar is added to get the taste and it is then packed and dispatched to the various dairy and milk product centers for sale. Basundi is an perishable item so needs to be preserved carefully. This item needs to be consumed with in 2\u20133 days from the date of manufacturing.\nHeavy cream may be added during the boiling process to hasten the thickening process.

Mote con huesillo is a traditional Chilean summer-time drink often sold in street stands or vendor carts. It is a non-alcoholic beverage consisting of a sweet clear nectar-like liquid made with dried peaches (huesillo) cooked in sugar, water and cinnamon, and then once cooled, mixed with fresh cooked husked wheat (mote). The sweet clear nectar is usually made with sugar, but can also be supplemented or replaced with molasses.\nWhen the drink is served without the dried peaches, it is called a \"descarozados\". On occasion, it may also be served with dried prunes, however this is less common.  Another modern option is to use peach preserves in place of the dried peaches.  Both the mote and huesillo correspond to Mediterranean climates, like that of central Chile. This drink is very popular during summer months and is sold by street vendors on rolling carts or stands. It is also a very popular homemade recipe, for which the ingredients are readily available in supermarkets, small grocery stores and farmers' markets. Bottled, canned or store packaged versions of mote con huesillo are limited and thus, not common.\n\"Cuisine of Chile, Desserts\". Archived from the original on 2008-12-08.

Original name: Baba au rhum. country: France. image: BabaRum.jpg. image_size: 250px. main_ingredient: Eggs, milk, butter, rum. name: Rum baba. region: Lorraine. type: Cake. The original form of the baba was similar to the baba or babka, a tall, cylindrical yeast cake (babka is still baked in Lithuania, Poland and Polish-influenced western Ukraine as well as in Polish communities over the world). The name means \"old woman\" or \"grandmother\" in most Slavic languages; babka is a diminutive of baba.\nThe modern baba au rhum (rum baba), with dried fruit and soaked in rum, was invented in the rue Montorgueil in Paris, France, in 1835 or before. Today, the word \"baba\" in France and almost everywhere else outside eastern Europe usually refers specifically to the rum baba.\nThe original baba was introduced into France in the 18th century via Lorraine. This is attributed to Stanislaus I, the exiled king of Poland. The Larousse Gastronomique has reported that Stanislaus had the idea of soaking a dried Gugelhupf (a cake roughly similar to the baba and common in Alsace-Lorraine when he arrived there) or a baba with alcoholic spirit. Another version is that when Stanislaus brought back a baba from one of his voyages it had dried up. Nicolas Stohrer, one of his p\u00e2tissiers (or possibly just apprentice p\u00e2tissiers at the time), solved the problem by adding Malaga wine, saffron, dried and fresh raisin and cr\u00eame p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re. The writer Courchamps stated in 1839 that the descendants of Stanislaus served the baba with a sauci\u00e8re containing sweet Malaga wine mixed with one sixth of Tanaisie liqueur.\nStohrer followed Stanislaus's daughter Marie Leszczy\u0144ska to Versailles as her p\u00e2tissier in 1725 when she married King Louis XV, and founded his p\u00e2tisserie in Paris in 1730. One of his descendants allegedly had the idea of using rum in 1835. While he is believed to have done so on the fresh cakes (right out of the mold), it is a common practice today to let the baba dry a little so that it soaks up the rum better. Later, the recipe was refined by mixing the rum with aromatized sugar syrup.\nThe baba is also popular in Naples, and became a popular Neapolitan specialty under the name bab\u00e0 or babb\u00e0.\nThe pastry has appeared on restaurant menus in the United States at least since 1899.\nIn 1844, the Julien Brothers, Parisian p\u00e2tissiers, invented the Savarin, which is strongly inspired by the baba au rhum but is soaked with a different alcoholic mixture and uses a circular (ring) cake mould instead of the simple round (cylindrical) form. The ring form is nowadays often associated with the baba au rhum as well, and the name Savarin is also sometimes given to the rum-soaked circular cake.\nBabka\nG\u00e2teau nantais\nRum cake\nGugelhupf\nList of cakes\nCourchamps, Dictionnaire G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Cuisine Fran\u00e7aise, 1839\nGrimod de La Reyni\u00e8re, \"Almanach des gourmands\", 1806\nHistory of the baba according to the P\u00e2tisserie Stohrer (possibly biased).\nMangoni, Fabrizio (23 September 2011). \"I viaggi del bab\u00e0\" (in Italian).\n\"Haan's Ladies' and Gentlemen's Restaurant,\" New York,  menu dated December 9, 1899: \"Dessert ...

The term is often used to just refer to the Gudbrandsdalsost (\"Gudbrandsdal Cheese\") type, which is the most popular variety. Brunost is primarily produced in Norway and is popular in both Norway and South Korea. It is regarded as one of the country's most iconic foodstuffs, and is considered an important part of Norwegian gastronomical and cultural identity and heritage.",

Boiling down whey 10:1 to create a brown, cheesy spread (such as the Norwegian prim and Swedish messm\u00f6r) has been common in the Scandinavian countries since time immemorial. An archeological find from September 2016 in central Jutland has determined that a cheese residue on pottery from circa 650 B.C.E. is a type of cheese, probably brunost.\nHowever, the creation of the modern, firm, fatty brunost is commonly attributed to the milkmaid Anne Hov from the rural valley of Gudbrandsdalen. In the second half of the 1800s,  Gudbrandsdalen was suffering economically due to falling profits from grain and butter sales. While working at the Valseter mountain farm near G\u00e5l\u00e5 in 1863, Anne Hov (sometimes named Anne Haav) came up with the idea of adding cream to the whey when boiling, and to boil it down in an iron pot until the fluid content was reduced to less than 80 percent, creating a firmer, fattier, more cheese-like product. She originally called it feitost (\"fat cheese\"). The name later changed into fl\u00f8temysost (\"cream whey cheese\"). The product immediately caught on, and was soon commonly produced and consumed in the area. This variety is currently the second most popular type in Norway. \nWhen Hov married and moved to Rusth\u00e5g\u00e5 farm in Nord-Fron, she started larger-scale production and invented a variety where she added goat's milk to the mix for a more pronounced taste. The local trader Ole Kongsli liked it so much he thought there might be a market for the product in the capital, Oslo. He started exporting it to his business contacts in Oslo under the name Gudbrandsdalsost (\"Gudbrand Valley Cheese\"), and it became so successful that it contributed significantly to the economy of the region, thus helping Gudbrandsdalen out of recession. In 1933, at age 87, Hov received the King's Medal of Merit (Kongens fortjenstmedalje) for her contributions to Norwegian cuisine and economy.\nIn modern times, the world's largest producer of brunost is the Norwegian dairy co-operative Tine, who market a total of 13 varieties, as well as three types of prim and three types of pultost. The second-largest is Norwegian dairy company Synn\u00f8ve Finden, which market two varieties of brunost, as well as two varieties of prim. There are also a number of smaller, artisanal producers, mainly in Norway and in the US.\nMysost are a family of cheese-related foods made with whey and milk and/or cream. The main ingredient, whey, is a byproduct of the cheese making process, it is what is left when the cheese is removed from the milk. Therefore, brunost is not technically cheese, and it does not taste like cheese. However, it is produced by cheese makers, and is sold, handled and consumed in the same way as cheese. Therefore, it is generally regarded as a cheese. The texture is firm, but slightly softer than Gouda cheese, for example, and lends itself well to cutting and shaping. It does not crumble like hard cheeses. The taste is sweet, and best described as caramel-like, but with a tang that is more noticeable in the variants that contain goat's milk. The variant Ekte Geitost (\"true goat's cheese\") contains only whey and goat's milk, and has an intense, Ch\u00e8vre-like taste that cuts the sweetness.\nBrunost is made by boiling a mixture of milk, cream, and whey carefully for several hours so that the water evaporates. The heat turns the milk sugars into caramel, which gives the cheese its characteristic brown colour and sweetness. It is ready for consumption as soon as it is packed and refrigerated. Low-fat varieties are made by increasing the proportion of whey to milk and cream.\nIn Norway, Brunost is commonly divided into two types: those that contain only cow's cream and/or milk, and the ones that contain some proportion of goat's milk. The latter type is commonly called Geitost or Gjetost (\"goat's cheese\"). Varieties that do not contain any cow's milk are called Ekte Geitost (\"true goat's cheese\"). Technically, the name \"true goat's cheese\" is misleading, since goat cheese (such as the French ch\u00e8vre) is relatively uncommon in Norway, and is commonly called Hvit geitost (\"white goat's cheese\") to avoid confusion.\nBy far the most popular variety is the Gudbrandsdalsost, which contains a mixture of cow and goat milk, cream, and whey. Heidal cheese is a type of Gudbrandsdalsost. In Norway it is so common that people just refer to it as \"Brunost\" or \"Geitost\", assuming that unless otherwise specified, Gudbrandsdalsost will be provided. This variety is also the most popular internationally, and in the US it is commonly",

In Sweden it is most commonly known as just semla (plural: semlor), but is also known as fettisdagsbulle (lit. \"fat tuesday roll\").

The name semla  (plural, semlor) is a loan word from German Semmel, originally deriving from the Latin simila, meaning 'flour', itself a borrowing from Greek \u03c3\u03b5\u03bc\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 (semidalis), \"groats\", which was the name used for the finest quality wheat flour or semolina.  In the southernmost part of Sweden (Scania) and by the Swedish-speaking population in Finland, they are known as fastlagsbulle. In Denmark and Norway they are known as fastelavnsbolle (fastlagen and fastelavn being the equivalent of Shrove Tuesday). In Scanian, the feast is also called fastelann. In Finnish they are known as laskiaispulla (which refers to the Finnish laskiainen), in Latvian as v\u0113ja k\u016bkas, and in Estonian as vastlakukkel.\nToday, the Swedish-Finnish semla consists of a cardamom-spiced wheat bun which has its top cut off, and is then filled with a mix of milk and almond paste, topped with whipped cream. The cut-off top serves as a lid and is dusted with powdered sugar. Today it is often eaten on its own, with coffee or tea. Some prefer to eat it in a bowl of hot milk. In Finland, the bun is often filled with strawberry or raspberry jam instead of almond paste, and bakeries in Finland usually offer both versions. (Many bakeries distinguish between the two by decorating the traditional bun with almonds on top, whereas the jam-filled version has powdered sugar on top). In Finland-Swedish, semla means a plain wheat bun, used for bread and butter, and not a sweet bun. At some point Swedes grew tired of the strict observance of Lent, added cream and almond paste to the mix and started eating semla every Tuesday between Shrove Tuesday and Easter. Every year, at around the same time that the bakeries fill with semlor, the Swedish newspapers start to fill with semla taste tests. Panels of 'experts' dissect and inspect tables full of semlor to find the best in town.\nSome bakeries have created alternative forms of the pastry, such as the \"semmelwrap\" formed as a wrap rather than the traditional bun, while others have added e.g. chocolate, marzipan, or pistachios to the recipe.\nIn Finland and Estonia the traditional dessert predates Christian influences. Laskiaissunnuntai and laskiaistiistai, both days included in laskiainen, were festivals when children and youth would go sledding or downhill sliding on a hill or a slope to determine how the crop would yield in the coming year. Those who slid the farthest were going to get the best crop. Hence the festival is named after the act of sliding or sledding downhill, laskea. Nowadays laskiainen has been integrated into Christian customs as the beginning of lent before Easter.\nFastelavnsbolle consists of a cardamom-spiced wheat bun which has its top cut off, and is then filled with whipped cream, topped with jam. The cut-off top serves as a lid and is dusted with powdered sugar. The buns are served at Sunday of Fastelavn (Shrove Sunday), but were previously associated with Shrove Tuesday.\nThe version sold in Danish bakeries on or around Shrove Monday is rather different, made from puff pastry and filled with whipped cream, a bit of jam and often with icing on top. At home people may bake a version more similar to a usual wheat roll, mixing plain yeast dough with raisins, succade and sometimes candied bitter orange peel.\nIn Iceland it is done in a similar way but in place of puff pastry more common is the choux pastry version.\nIn Icelandic, Shrove Monday is called bolludagur (bun day), named after the pastry.\nIn the Faroe Islands, it is done with choux pastry, and filled with vanilla cream, whipped cream and jam, and topped with chocolate icing.\nThe oldest version of the semla was a plain bread bun, eaten in a bowl of warm milk. In Swedish this is known as hetv\u00e4gg, from Middle Low German hete Weggen (hot wedges) or German heisse Wecken (hot buns) and falsely interpreted as \"hotwall\".\nThe semla was originally eaten only on Shrove Tuesday, or all of the three days before Lent, as the last festive food before Lent. However, with the arrival of the Protestant Reformation, the Swedes stopped observing a strict fasting for Lent.  The semla in its bowl of warm milk became a traditional dessert every Tuesday between Shrove Tuesday and Easter. Today, semlor are available in shops and bakeries every day from shortly after Christmas until Easter. Each Swede consumes on average four to five bakery-produced semlor each year, in addition to any that are homemade.\nKing Adolf Frederick of Sweden died of",

                "description": "Onions, carrots, bell peppers and tomatoes are fried together in a pan before adding the fish and shellfish (with their shells kept on) and frying altogether until juices begin to run. Some recipes then add a further selection of shellfish, sometimes canned, with the shells removed, and extras like paprika and white wine. Fish stock is poured over the fried ingredients and the soup is left to simmer until rich and flavorsome. Salt can be added to taste, though it is not always required, as the reduction of the liquid and the presence of the shellfish increase the saltiness of the dish. The soup can be served with a garnish of herbs, such as parsley.",

Paila marina is a traditional Chilean seafood soup or light stew usually served in a paila (earthenware bowl). It usually contains a shellfish stock base cooked with different kinds of shellfish and fish. These are complemented with a variety of herbs and spices such as paprika and parsley.\nClams\nChilean mussels\nEels\nMachas (from the Pharidae family of mussels)\nTunica rocks\nGiant barnacles\nShrimp\nRed bell peppers\nOnions\nTomato\nFish stock\nParsley\nPaprika\nSalt and pepper if required\nHabanero Peppers (optional and sparingly)\nLemon (on side)\nIt is traditional for groups of friends or family to go to the local seafood market and enjoy a paila marina, especially the morning after a party, when it is believed to aid recovery from a hangover. On January 1, the historic seafood market Mercado Central de Santiago is one of the busiest places in Santiago; Chilean national newspaper La Naci\u00f3n reported that 28,000 people were expected to visit the market on January 1, 2010. Popular belief also ascribes aphrodisiac properties to paila marina.\nIn the episode \"Abiquiu\" of the US TV series Breaking Bad, the character Gus Fring, a prominent Chilean methamphetamine distributor in the southwest of the United States, prepares a paila marina for Walter White while explaining the origin of this typical Chilean dish.

                "description": "The first rule when buying snails is generally to choose alive snails. Dead snails have scales (flakes) that have already been indented, and alive snails only retract when touched. In addition, dead snails often smell. If we drop snails into a basin full of water, dead snails will rotate the bottom up, picking them up, they will be light. Snail after buying is not cooked immediately. To clean snails thoroughly, you should soak them overnight in rice water, after that, rubbing snail's shell by a brush under the water flow. Or you can drop a small iron knife into a pot of water soaked in snails. The smell of iron in water will stimulate snails to release mud and dirt faster and more thoroughly. ...",

B\u00fan \u1ed1c (\"snail vermicelli soup\") is a Vietnamese dish originating from Hanoi, Vietnam. Roasted or boiled snails (\u1ed1c lu\u1ed9c), may be eaten first as an appetizer. Snail congee is called ch\u00e1o \u1ed1c, and canh \u1ed1c chu\u1ed1i \u0111\u1eadu, is a thin snail soup with green banana, fried tofu and t\u00eda t\u00f4.\nThough it isn't known when this dish was first created, it is certainly one of the most typical dishes of Vietnamese cuisine.  It's speculated to have  come from a certain countryside, then followed the footsteps of immigrants to Thang Long citadel and became a specialty there.  A related dish called luosifen (snail noodles) is popular across the border in Guangxi, China.\nThe Hanoian often choose snails which are smaller and chewier than their land-based cousins. Fat and fresh snails are preferable, with rice noodles that were not soaked in water for too long. Cooks choose the best bun (rice noodle), which means thin and clear noodles. Bun oc not only contains broth, snails, and tofu as its basic characteristics but it can also contain green bananas, some fresh vegetables or chopped water spinach, bean sprouts, water dropwort, tomatoes, and other ingredients.\n\"gi\u1ea5m b\u1ed7ng\", a Vietnamese vinegar, is added for acidity and to highlight the taste, as well as a sweeter tomato broth. The ingredients are tangled white rice vermicelli noodles (similar to regular white rice vermicelli noodles but thinner) and boiled snails. B\u00fan \u1ed1c can be served in two different ways: in its broth (called \"hot snail noodles\") or with broth in a separate bowl (called \"cold snail noodles\") with vegetables. The broth is made from stewed bones, tomatoes, and other ingredients. Cold snail noodles,  which are eaten by dipping the noodles in the broth, are a popular meal during the summer.\nShrimp paste and chili are optional, although purists like Vietnamese writer Vu Bang insist on adding those for a more piquant flavor. In Mon ngon Ha Noi by Vu Bang said \"It is a gift, which can be said to have achieved the goal of culinary art of Hanoians.\"\n\nThanh Nien Slimy scrumptious snails June 17, 2011 \"\u1ed0c lu\u1ed9c is a simple snack and can be considered the appetizer for a series of snail courses. After \u1ed1c lu\u1ed9c, my mother would cook snail and noodle soup, b\u00fan \u1ed1c, or a sort of snail porridge called ch\u00e1o \u1ed1c, or canh \u1ed1c chu\u1ed1i \u0111\u1eadu, which is a snail soup with green banana, fried tofu and t\u00eda t\u00f4 (perilla leaves)\"\nAnthony Bourdain No Reservations: Around the World on an Empty Stomach  2007\n\"B\u00fan \u1ed1c - a tasty destination for Hanoi people\".

Hainanese curry rice developed during British colonial rule in Singapore. It was started by Hainanese living in Singapore, who were often employed by the British as well as the wealthy Peranakans (Straits-Chinese) as chefs in their homes. Pork chop was adapted from British cuisine and the rest of the ingredients, such as curry chicken, babi pongteh and chap chye, were from Peranakan cuisine. These were adapted for Hainanese curry rice. Loo's, one of the most well-known and popular Hainanese curry rice vendors in Singapore, started operations in 1946 and is situated opposite Tiong Bahru Market.\n\nTraditionally, steamed white rice forms the base of this dish. In recent years, some outlets, for example Jin Soon Fa Curry Rice, offer brown rice as an option.\nThe curry is milder and gloopier than its South Asian variant.\nTeochew porridge\nList of rice dishes\nChen, Evelyn (14 April 2011). \"Singapore hawker hunting with food blogger Leslie Tay\".

It can be served for breakfast or as a dessert item. The basic recipe is made with just semolina (farina), sugar or honey, ghee, and sometimes milk.

In Medieval Arabic cuisine semolina halvah was made by roasting the milled wheat in butter and adding honey or sugar syrup to moisten the dessert. One recipe for hulwa a'jamiyya is made by boiling honey to create the syrup (diluted with water if needed) and garnished with pistachio and poppyseed.  Milk can be added, as well as toppings like almonds, pistachios and pine nuts. Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th-century cookbook includes varieties made with carrots, apple and dates. According to some scholars, this dish was introduced to India by the Mughals, but it is already listed as shali-anna, present-day Kesari bat, in Manasollasa, a 12th-century work by a south Indian Chalukyan king, Someshvara III.\nIn 14th-century Spain, semolina was cooked with almond milk, oil and optionally saffron for coloring. In India, sheera is made from common-wheat semolina (farina), ghee, and sugar; cardamom and milk, almonds and cashew-nuts are added.\nIn Marathi, the halwa made with semolina is called rawa sheera (\u0930\u0935\u093e \u0936\u0940\u0930\u093e). When the similar halwa is prepared with wheat flour it's called gavhacya pithaca sheera (\u0917\u0935\u094d\u0939\u093e\u091a\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092a\u0940\u0920\u093e\u091a\u093e \u0936\u0940\u0930\u093e).\nIn Hindi, it is sooji ka halwa (\u0938\u0942\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u093e \u0939\u0932\u0935\u093e).\nIn south India, the dish is currently called Kesari Bat.\nIn Myanmar (Burma), the dish is called sanwin makin.\nIn the Caribbean, it is known by Indo-Caribbeans as Mohan bhog or simply just as parsad, as it is a common sweet that Hindu Indo-Caribbeans charhaway or offer as prasad in pujas. It is called Sajjige in parts of Tulunadu.\nKesari bhath\nGoldstein, Darra (2015). The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets. Oxford University Press.\nRondinson, Maxime;  et\u00a0al. (1998).

They are made of small  lumps of dough composed of semolina, ordinary wheat flour, egg, cheese, potato, breadcrumbs, cornmeal or similar ingredients, and possibly including herbs, vegetables, and other ingredients. The dough for gnocchi is most often rolled out before it is cut into small pieces about the size of a wine cork. The dumplings may be pressed with a fork or a cheese grater to make ridges or cut into little lumps. Gnocchi are usually eaten as a first course, but they can also be served as a contorno (side dish) to some main courses. ...",

The word gnocchi may be derived from the Italian word nocchio, meaning a knot in wood, or from nocca, meaning knuckle. It has been a traditional type of Italian pasta since Roman times. It was introduced by the Roman legions during the expansion of the empire into the countries of the European continent. One ancient Roman recipe consists of a semolina porridge-like dough mixed with eggs; similar modern dishes include the baked gnocchi alla romana and Sardinian malloreddus which do not contain eggs.\nAfter potatoes were introduced to Europe, they were eventually incorporated into gnocchi recipes. Potato gnocchi are particularly popular in Abruzzo, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, and Lazio.\n\nGnocchi that are home-made are usually consumed on the same day that they are made.\nCommercial gnocchi are often sold under modified atmospheric packaging, and may achieve a shelf life of two weeks or more under refrigeration.\nGnocchi di pane (literally \"bread lumps\"), derived from the Semmelkn\u00f6del, is made from breadcrumbs and is popular in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol. Another variety from the latter region is spinach gnocchi.\nIn Austria, gnocchi are a common main or side dish, known by the original name and Austrian variant, nockerl (pl. nockerln). As a side dish, they may accompany main dishes like goulash.\nGnocchi are a very popular and often served as a dish in coastal Croatia, typically being served as a first course or a side dish with Dalmatinska pa\u0161ticada. The Croatian name for Gnocchi is 'njoki'.\nGnocchi, known locally as \"njoki,\" are common in Slovenia's Primorska region, which shares many of its culinary traditions with neighboring Italy.\nAn almost identical creation are 'kluski leniwe' (\"lazy dumplings\"), but do not contain egg. Often they are spiced with various herbs like pepper, cinnamon or allspice. Similar in shape are kopytka (\"hooves\"), simple dough dumplings in the shape of a diamond, which do not contain cheese. Both are often served with sour cream, butter, caramelized onion, mushroom sauce, or gravy.\nThe name is also used in France in the dish known as gnocchis \u00e0 la parisienne, a hot dish comprising gnocchi formed of choux pastry served with B\u00e9chamel sauce. A specialty of Nice, the gnocchi de tantifla a la nissarda, is made with potatoes, wheat flour, eggs and blette (Swiss chard), which is also used for the tourte de blette. La merda d\u00e9 can is longer than the original gnocchi.\nDue to the significant number of Italian immigrants who arrived in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, gnocchi, \u00f1oqui (Spanish, [\u02c8\u0272oki]) or nhoque (Portuguese, pronounced\u00a0[\u02c8\u0272\u0254ki]) is a popular dish, even in areas with few Italian immigrants. In Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina there is a tradition of eating gnocchi on the 29th of each month, with some people putting money beneath their plates to bring prosperity. Indeed, in Argentina and Uruguay \u00f1oqui is slang for a bogus employee (according to corrupt accountancy practices, or, in the public sector, the distribution of political patronage), who only turns up at the end of the month to receive their salary.\n\nList of dumplings\nList of pastas\nSchupfnudel\n\"gnocchi\".

In the Vietnamese language, b\u00e1nh means \"cake\", and b\u00f2 can either mean \"cow\" or \"to crawl\". According to Paulus Hu\u1ef3nh T\u1ecbnh C\u1ee7a's 1895 dictionary \u0110\u1ea1i Nam qu\u1ed1c \u00e2m t\u1ef1 v\u1ecb, the dessert is named for its resemblance to a cow's udder, implying that the name was shortened from b\u00e1nh v\u00fa b\u00f2. However, according to a popular folk etymology, b\u00f2 refers to how the cake \"crawls\" up to the rim of the bowl when steamed to completion.\nB\u00e1nh b\u00f2 is to be distinguished from the less common b\u00e1nh b\u00f3 (\"pressed cake\"), a fruit cake found in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province; b\u00f2 (\"cow\", \"beef\") is pronounced with a falling tone, whereas b\u00f3 (\"pressed\") has a rising tone.\nThere are varieties of b\u00e1nh b\u00f2:\nB\u00e1nh b\u00f2 n\u01b0\u1edbng (lit.\u2009'baked b\u00e1nh b\u00f2') - This variety of b\u00e1nh b\u00f2 is cooked by baking in a pan in an oven. It is generally off-white or yellowish-white in color on the inside and golden on the outside by caramelized coconut milk. Individual cakes are often large in size, in which case a serving will consist of a slice rather than the whole cake. This variety is definitely served alone.\nB\u00e1nh b\u00f2 h\u1ea5p (lit.\u2009'steamed b\u00e1nh b\u00f2') is similar in appearance to the baked version. These cakes are often small in size, ball-shaped and cooked from the liquid. B\u00e1nh b\u00f2 h\u1ea5p may be white in color, green (by Pandanus amaryllifolius extract), pink or pale purple (by magenta plant extract). There are three ways to serve this variety. Like b\u00e1nh b\u00f2 n\u01b0\u1edbng, it can be used alone. It can be put in the middle of b\u00e1nh ti\u00eau (Chinese hollow doughnuts) and served. Also, people enjoy them in a small dish with coconut milk sauce including tapioca starch on top and a little bit mu\u1ed1i m\u00e8 or mu\u1ed1i \u0111\u1eadu ph\u1ed9ng (literally: sesame salt and peanut salt, respectively).\nBoth traditional varieties are available in Vietnam as well as in Asian grocery stores in countries with substantial overseas Vietnamese populations, such as the United States and France.\nB\u00e1nh b\u00f2 s\u1eefa (n\u01b0\u1edbng) (lit.\u2009'(baked) milk b\u00e1nh b\u00f2') is a brand new variety of b\u00e1nh b\u00f2 appearing in the mid-2000s. Coconut milk, the official traditional ingredient is replaced by condensed milk or milk powder. The variety is cooked in a small pan.\nB\u00e1nh b\u00f2 d\u1eeba (lit.\u2009'coconut b\u00e1nh b\u00f2') is the latest variety of b\u00e1nh b\u00f2 appearing in the late 2000s. It is not generally recognized because it seems totally different from three above mainly from core ingredients. Core ingredients are wheat powder, hen eggs, baking soda, and obviously sweetened coconut. It tastes much leathery, seldom hard crispy and silky in the skin as opposed three above. In the middle, there is sweetened coconut with cooked mung bean.\nThe Indian steamed rice cake called idli is similar in texture, although idli are never sweet. However, the dish is quite similar to the Vattayappam (a type of appam from Kerala, India).\nWhite sugar sponge cake\nIdli\nBika ambon\nThanh Nien Weekly print edition August 26, 2011 Rural cakes awaken the child within \"B\u00e1nh b\u00f2 (literally \"cow cake\") is a sweet and chewy sponge cake.

B\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi originated from the B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Province of Vietnam's South Central Coast region. People in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh eat b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi for almost any meal during the day, instead of rice or noodle soups.\nMaking b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi is a multistep process. First, good rice is soaked in water overnight, then washed with water again three or four times until the water comes out clean. Then the rice is either ground with water into a mixture, or ground without water, but mixed into the water three or four times afterwards to leaven it without using any additional agent. The flour mixture is then either steamed and kneaded, or cooked in a pan, stirred continuously until it starts to coagulate, but no flour gets stuck on the stirring tool. This step is crucial in making b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi soft, light, and not sticky, but the strings of noodles will still have a firm texture. When the experienced b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi maker feels the dough is done, it is ready for pressing.\nSpecial copper or aluminium cylinders, with several small holes (the size of a needle eye), shape the cooked dough into noodle form. Pressing the dough requires great strength, as the dough is hard and the holes are small, so it is usually done with leverage. When one person presses the dough, another \"catches\" the noodles coming out on the other side, presses them together and cuts them off every 10\u00a0cm or so, creating a kind of mesh of noodle, which is then laid onto a flat surface, but not in layers. Finally, the sheets are steamed one last time for about five minutes.\nLike b\u00fan (rice vermicelli) dishes, b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi is served cold. Traditionally b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh is rolled into bundles and always served with chopped garlic chives. The garlic chives are quickly stir-fried with oil, its aroma and taste go well with b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi, which makes the dish enjoyable by itself and without any other kinds of herbs.\nIn central Vietnam, such as Hu\u1ebf, b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi is eaten with dried prawns and n\u01b0\u1edbc ch\u1ea5m. In southern Vietnam, b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi is eaten with a variety of meats, especially roast pork or duck. There are also b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi ch\u1ea3 gi\u00f2, b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi with shrimp paste on sugar cane stick, and b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi with grilled pork, chicken, or beef. At the G\u00f2 Du\u1ed1i market in Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c commune, S\u00f4ng C\u1ea7u district, Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean Province, one also finds b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi l\u00f2ng heo G\u00f2 Du\u1ed1i, which is b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi with boiled pig offal.\nSince making b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi is a skilful process, the dish is highly regarded, and is served at ceremonial parties, such as wedding and ancestor memorial days.\nCovering b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi tightly reduces surface drying, which can make it sour, so market sellers put fresh b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi in bamboo baskets with banana leaves, and usually leave it open to the air. For convenience or sanitary reasons, there are dried, packaged b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi, similar to dried, packaged rice vermicelli, for people who want to cook it themselves instead of buying fresh b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi from the markets.\nVietnamese noodles\n\"B\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi \u0111\u1ea5t v\u00f5\". 2 September 2009.\nhttp://phuyennet.vn/khcndp/index.php?menu=detail&mid=54&nid=365 Trang Th\u00f4ng tin KHCN Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean\nvietbao.vn. \"V\u1ec1 B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh \u0103n b\u00e1nh h\u1ecfi\". vietbao.vn.",

When bought in supermarkets in the UK (under several brands, all very similar), Garibaldi biscuits usually come in four strips of five biscuits each. They have a golden brown, glazed exterior and a moderately sweet pastry, but their defining characteristic is the layer of squashed fruit which gives rise to the colloquial names fly sandwiches, flies' graveyards, dead fly biscuits, or squashed fly biscuits, because the squashed fruit resemble squashed flies.\nThe Garibaldi biscuit was named after Giuseppe Garibaldi, an Italian general and leader of the struggle to unify the Kingdom of Italy.  Garibaldi made a popular visit to South Shields in England in 1854. The biscuit was first manufactured by the Bermondsey biscuit company Peek Freans in 1861 following the recruitment of Jonathan Carr, one of the great biscuit makers of Carlisle. In the United States, the Sunshine Biscuit Company for many years made a popular version of the Garibaldi with raisins which it called \"Golden Fruit\". Sunshine was bought out by the Keebler Company which briefly expanded the line to include versions filled with other fruits. The entire Golden Fruit product line was discontinued when the Keebler company became a division of Kellogg's in 2001.\nVarieties covered with plain or milk chocolate have also been marketed in the past, but appear not to have been available for many years.\nFlies' graveyard\n\"FullO'Fruit\".

The term pindang refer to the cooking process of boiling the ingredients in salt together with certain spices that contains tannin, usually soy sauce, shallot skin, guava leaves, teak leaves, tea or other spices common in Southeast Asia. This gives the food a dark brown color and lasts longer compared to plainly boiled eggs, thus pindang is an Indonesian traditional method to preserve food, usually employed for fish and eggs. The technique is native to Java and Sumatra. Other preserving method includes asin or cured and dried in salt, and dendeng which is cured and dried in sugar, acar (pickling), and also asap (smoked).\n\nToday, the telur pindang is widely spread throughout Indonesian archipelago, however it is found more prevalent in Javanese cuisine of Central and East Java, and also South Sumatra. Despite sharing similarities with Chinese tea eggs that employs tea leaves, this Indonesian version favours the use of teak leaves, guava leaves or spared shallots skin instead. The use of teak leaf as coloring agent might suggest its Javanese origin, since Java is famous for its teak wood for centuries. The teak leaf is also used to give reddish color in Yogyakarta's gudeg, or even as dyeing material in traditional Javanese batik-making. Indonesian cuisine favour the use of shallots than common onion, and subsequently the peeled shallot skins are usually collected and spared as key ingredient to make pindang eggs later.\nThe telur pindang is often served as part of tumpeng, nasi kuning or nasi campur. In Yogyakarta, telur pindang often served with gudeg or just steamed rice. It is also part of Chinese Indonesian lontong cap go meh. Those dishes, the tumpeng, nasi kuning, and lontong cap go meh, are important ceremonial dishes for each respective cultures, since eggs are traditionally symbolize fertility, regeneration and luck.\nTelur pindang in Malaysia is most popular in Johor, the southern-most state in Peninsular Malaysia. The true origins of the dish is unclear, however the cuisine most likely originated from Chinese merchants and settlers who came to the country in the 19th century through the once independent sultanate, having significant similarities to tea eggs. \nAnother possible theory suggests that it was probably brought by Javanese immigrants instead, that settled in Johor about a century ago. The recipe might have caught on due to its preserved nature. With Johor being a hub of international trade, it would be useful to the many merchants at sea who can benefit from such an easily stored food item that lasted for weeks.\nThe common ingredients of telur pindang are shallot skins, tamarind, fennel, coriander, soysauce, and various leaves such as guava leaves or mangosteen leaves, although different recipes have different mixes of these ingredients or even additional ingredients, giving it a unique flavor. The notable difference between Malaysian and Indonesian telur pindang is the use of teak leaves, which are replaced with other leaves in most traditional Malaysian telur pindang recipes.\nTelur pindang has a deep cultural heritage within Johorean, and in turn Malaysian, society. However, the daily use of telur pindang is now far more uncommon today due to its complicated and time-consuming method of cooking, restricted to mostly festivities or commercial sale. In turn, this creates an appreciation for the cuisine, regarded as an important part of Malay tradition.\nJavanese cuisine\nNasi ambeng\nBalado\n\"Indonesian Marbled Hard Boiled Eggs or Telur Pindang\".

Then a layer of shredded iceberg lettuce is added, dressed with garlic sauce and sambal, a hot sauce from  Indonesia, a former Dutch Colony. The term kapsalon is Dutch for \"hairdressing salon\", alluding to one of the inventors of the dish who worked as a hairdresser. The dish is a product of Dutch multiculturalism, combining elements of dishes from multiple cultures. The dish has spread internationally in a relatively short time.",

The dish was conceived in 2003 by Nathani\u00ebl Gomes, a Cabo Verdean hairdresser in the Rotterdam district of Delfshaven, who one day at the neighboring shawarma store \"El Aviva\" asked to combine all his favorite ingredients into one dish. He began regularly to request what the restaurant called \"the usual order for the kapsalon\". Other customers noticed and started to order the kapsalon too, and it became a \"hit\", soon being demanded in nearby snack bars. The dish has since spread around the Netherlands into Belgium, among other countries. In some places the shawarma meat may be replaced with chicken, or doner kebab meat. The kapsalon has been described as \"a typical example of contemporary cultural heritage\", and \"representative of the transnational nature of the city\". It has also been described as a \"calorie bomb\" and \"culinary lethal weapon\", with high fat content and up to 1,800 kilocalories (7,500\u00a0kJ) in a large serving.\nThe kapsalon reached the Nepalese capital city of Kathmandu in 2017, when a chef returning from a visit to the Netherlands was asked to prepare a \"typically Dutch\" meal. Now chicken or fish replace the shawarma meat, and a porcelain plate substitutes for the metal tray, but the kapsalon has become fashionable, with many people posting photos and a prominent food blogger describing the dish as \"a party in her mouth with her favorite tastes\". The dish can be found in other cities throughout Europe as well, such as Riga, Latvia or Oulu, Finland.\nCarne asada fries\nChorrillana\nGyros\nHalal snack pack\nMitraillette\nPoutine\nSterre Lindhout (14 September 2011). \"Culinair moordwapen\" [Culinary lethal weapon].

Paneer tikka is an Indian dish made from chunks of paneer marinated in spices and grilled in a tandoor. It is a vegetarian alternative to chicken tikka and other meat dishes. It is a popular dish that is widely available in India and countries with an Indian diaspora.\nWhen paneer tikka is served with a sauce, it is called paneer tikka masala. It is also served as with a wrap, paneer tikka roll, where the paneer tikka is wrapped into an Indian bread and served. A variant of paneer tikka is also made as a kebab.\nOver the years, there have been several variations, such as Kashmiri paneer tikka, where the paneer is stuffed with chopped almonds and grilled, a variety of Chinese food, paneer tikka masala chow mein, and dosa stuffed with paneer tikka.\nInternational fast food chains in India have also incorporated paneer tikka into their menus, such as Pizza Hut and Domino's which offer a paneer tikka topping on their pizzas, whereas Subway offers a paneer tikka sandwich and McDonald's has a paneer tikka wrap on its menu. ITC's Bingo brand of potato chips has experimented with a paneer tikka flavour of chips. Prior to that, in 2003, Nestle's Maggi experimented with a ready to cook variety of paneer tikka.

Palak paneer ([pa\u02d0l\u0259k p\u0259ni\u02d0\u027e]) is a vegetarian dish, consisting of paneer (a type of cottage cheese) in a thick paste made from pur\u00e9ed spinach, called palak in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and other Indian languages.\nThe terms palak paneer and saag paneer are sometimes used interchangeably in restaurants in the United States and Canada. However, saag paneer is different from traditional palak paneer in that it contains other green leafy vegetables, such as mustard greens, whereas palak paneer only contains spinach. Dhaba restaurants often specialize in palak paneer.\nPalak paneer is served hot with a side such as roti, naan, paranthas, makki di roti, or boiled rice. It can also be served with onions on the side for a more traditional approach.\nIn recent years, there have been fusion variations of palak paneer. In July 2020, a Bangalore-based food blogger posted her variation of palak paneer idli. The dish sparked conversation on Twitter and Instagram about the unusual combination of these two North and South Indian dishes. In September 2020, Vietnam-based Pizza 4P's created unique fusion pizzas in honor of the International Day of Peace. One of these variations was a palak paneer-chapli kebab pizza to symbolize peace between India and Pakistan.\nSaag paneer\nSarson ka saag\n\u00a0Food portal\nPastime, Palatable. \"PALAK PANEER (INDIAN FRESH SPINACH WITH PANEER CHEESE)\".\n\"spinach - Meaning in hindi - Shabdkosh\". www.shabdkosh.com.

The name literally means \"apple slices\" in Danish, although apples are not usually an ingredient in present-day versions. The crust is similar in texture to European pancakes, but with a light and fluffy innard like a Yorkshire pudding. The English language spelling is usually aebleskiver or ebleskiver.\n\u00c6bleskiver are cooked on the stove top by baking in a special pan with several hemispherical indentations. The pan exists in versions for gas and electrical stoves (the latter with a plain bottom). Pans are usually made of cast iron, allowing good heat retention. Traditional models in hammered copper plate exist but are today used primarily for decoration.\nIn Denmark, \u00e6bleskiver are less common in restaurants than they are at casual family gatherings. They can also be found being sold by street vendors in the winter. They are traditionally served with jam and powdered sugar and three are placed on a plate at a time. They are traditionally eaten during the Christmas season and are often served with gl\u00f8gg (Scandinavian mulled wine) or Scandinavian coffee. They are often sold at Christmas markets, charity markets, open-air events, Scouting functions, local sports gatherings and similar venues. They are also served at children's birthday parties, due to their popularity and easy preparation. Voluntary associations gain profit from preparing them from the pre-fried, frozen stage and selling them, usually three at a time, with the usual condiments.\nIn North America there are several annual events that celebrate \u00e6bleskiver and Danish culture, with churches and museums holding \"\u00c6bleskiver Suppers\" and similar events.\nThe exact origin of \u00e6bleskiver is unknown. One popular speculation is that a band of Vikings were part of a difficult battle. When they returned to their ship, they wished to cook a meal similar to pancakes. However, since they lacked regular pans, they instead used their shields or helmets, resulting in a cake with a spherical shape.\nAccording to another explanation, the custom of making a special sliced-apple dish originated in the Middle Ages when it was impossible to store raw apples beyond a certain date. The last apples of the year's harvest were sliced, used to flavor gl\u00f8gg, scooped out of the gl\u00f8gg, wrapped in dough, and fried in fat or butter like a Berliner. This is the origin of the name, which means \"apple slices\". In the 17th century, as cast iron pans with hemispherical concavities became available, \u00e6bleskiver could be easily made throughout the year, and the variety of fruit and other fillings expanded.\nThe first appearance of the word \"\u00e6bleskiver\" occurs in Peters Jul (1866), a book of Yule poems by Johan Krohn (1841\u20131925; son of Frederik Christopher Krohn and brother of Pietro Krohn). \"Apple-filled \u00e6bleskiver\" are also mentioned in the 1872 story \"The Cripple\" (Kr\u00f8blingen) by Hans Christian Andersen.\nIn the United States, pans were manufactured by Griswold Manufacturing.\nPuff Puff (food)\nList of doughnut varieties\nDanish cuisine\u00a0\u2013 Culinary traditions of Denmark\nEgg waffle\u00a0\u2013 Small spherical pancakes\nGai daan jai, a similar Chinese dish.\nJemput-jemput\u00a0\u2013 Indonesian and Malaysian fritter, similar Malaysian snack.\nKue cucur\u00a0\u2013 Indonesian traditional snack, similar Indonesian snack.\nList of pancakes\nMunker, the Norwegian version.\nPaniyaram, a similar dish from the south of India that comes in sweet and savoury varieties.\nPoffertjes\u00a0\u2013 Traditional Dutch batter treat, a similar Dutch dish that is sweet.\nPopover\u00a0\u2013 Light, hollow roll made from an egg batter\nTakoyaki\u00a0\u2013 Japanese appetizer, a savoury Japanese version that features octopus.\nUnni Appam, a similar dish from Kerala that is made in both sweet and spicy styles.\n\u00a0Food portal\n\"History\".

F\u0151zel\u00e9k is a type of thick Hungarian vegetable stew or soup, similar to pottage. F\u0151zel\u00e9k is a special category in Hungarian cuisine, not  quite like a soup, and thinner than a stew. It is simply cooked, typically by simmering, not mashing. It is usually not cooked with meat, but bacon and spicy sausage may be added for flavor. F\u0151zel\u00e9k is often eaten as the main course for lunch or like a garnish for different meat courses. F\u0151zel\u00e9k was typically a home-made food, and was considered as an ordinary type of meal so traditionally it seldom appeared on restaurant menus but in recent years, as part of the culinary revolution in Hungary, f\u0151zel\u00e9k enjoys a revival and it is much more common to be found on menus, there are even places dedicated to offering various f\u0151zel\u00e9k as main course.\nIts name roots in the verb f\u0151z (\"cook\"), modified by the -(a/e)l\u00e9k suffix which renders the meaning to the results of the verb. Thus the word f\u0151zel\u00e9k approximately means \"[something] created by cooking\". Hence in Hungarian a prefix is always used to make clear what the given f\u0151zel\u00e9k is actually made of, e.g.: t\u00f6kf\u0151zel\u00e9k (traditionally made of marrow but zucchini or other type of squash is also becoming popular), babf\u0151zel\u00e9k (made of beans) etc.\nList of stews\nEmperor's Crumbs, The culinary crossroads of Central Europe Archived 2010-07-09 at the Wayback Machine.\nJune Meyers Authentic Hungarian Heirloon Recipes Cookbook\nGundel's Hungarian Cookbook, Karoly Gundel.",

The origin of the dish is claimed by both the Southern regions of Campania and Sicily. Other variations found outside Italy may include chicken, veal, or another type of meat cutlet or vegetable filling.\nThere are several theories about the origin of the dish. Most frequently its invention is attributed to either Parma, Sicily or Naples. The case for Parma is that Parmigiana refers to Parma and because Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese is produced there. Sicilian food writers have several different explanations for a Sicilian origin. According to author Pino Correnti the word parmigiana derives from the Sicilian word for damigiana, a wicker sleeve used both for wine bottles and the hot casserole in which the dish would be prepared and served. Authors Mary Taylor Simeti, Vincent Schiavelli, and several others write that the name derives from the Sicilian word for louver, palmigiana. The angled horizontal slats of a louver would resemble the layering of eggplant slices in the dish. Writer Franca Colonna Romano Apostolo suggests that the name is parmiciana, which means Persian in Sicilian.\nAuthor Clifford Wright argues that the case for Parma is not convincing because Parmigiano-Reggiano was already widely traded since the 14th century. Parmigiano-Reggiano also was not an important ingredient in the original dish. Because eggplant was first introduced to Sicily and the other southern regions, it is more likely that an eggplant dish was invented there. Finally, the dish is popular in Campania in general, Naples in particular, as well as Sicily and Calabria, but not in Parma. Wright considers the case for a Sicilian origin speculative because there is no evidence to support it.\nWright traces the origin of parmigiana to Naples. The ancestor of the modern dish appears in Vincenzo Corrado's cookbook Il cuoco galante from 1786. His recipe described eggplant seasoned with butter, herbs, cinnamon, other spices and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, which was then covered with a cream sauce of egg yolks before being baked in an oven. The modern version with Parmigiano-Reggiano and tomato rag\u00f9 as key ingredients appears several years later in Ippolito Cavalcanti's cookbook Cucina teorico-pratica which was published in Naples in 1837. According to Wright this suggests that the dish evolved in Naples during this time frame, which coincided with the increasing popularity of the tomato in Italian cuisine. Author Marlena Spieler agrees with a Neapolitan origin of the dish for the same reasons.\nIn Naples, Parmigiana is also prepared using zucchini or artichokes in place of eggplants.\nIn Apulia, Parmigiana is prepared not only frying eggplants but also breading them\nVariations made with breaded meat cutlets, such as veal and chicken, have been popularized in other countries, usually in areas of Italian immigration. In such areas the original dish may be called eggplant parmigiana to distinguish it from the meat versions.\nIn the United States and Canada, chicken parmigiana and veal parmigiana are often served as a main course often with a side of pasta. Chicken parmigiana is also served as the filling of a submarine sandwich. The alternative anglicization Parmesan is sometimes used instead, and the abbreviated form parm is common. The use of meats as an alternate to eggplant originated in the United States, where it was influenced by similar Italian dishes. A similar veal dish is known in Italian as Cotoletta alla bolognese, which excludes tomato sauce but includes melted Parmesan cheese and prosciutto. Costolette Parmigiana is another similar veal dish, but in Italy it is generally served without sauce or cheese. \nChicken parmigiana is also a common dish in Australia and is often served with a side of chips or salad. In Australia, where the name is often shortened to parma or parmi, it may also contain a variety of toppings, including sliced ham or bacon.\nIn Argentina and in other neighboring South American countries, veal or chicken parmigiana is topped with ham and served with french fries. It is known as milanesa a la napolitana. If the dish is topped with a fried egg, it is known as Milanesa a caballo, but omits the tomato sauce.\nIn England, the parmo uses either pork or chicken topped with b\u00e9chamel sauce instead of tomato sauce.\nList of eggplant dishes\nList of veal dishes\nCarne pizzaiola\nWright, Clifford A. \"A History of Eggplant Parmesan\".

Fettuccine Alfredo ([fettut't\u0283i\u02d0ne al\u02c8fre\u02d0do]) or fettuccine al burro (\"fettuccine with butter\") is an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan cheese (Italian: pasta al burro e parmigiano). As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the pasta. The dish is named after Alfredo di Lelio, who featured the dish at his restaurant in Rome in the early to mid-20th century; the \"ceremony\" of preparing it tableside was an integral part of the dish.\nThe dish became widespread and eventually spread to the United States, where it remains popular. The recipe has evolved, and its commercialized version\u2014with heavy cream and other ingredients\u2014is now ubiquitous. In the U.S., it is often served as a main course, sometimes garnished with chicken or other ingredients. In Italy, meanwhile, fettuccine al burro is generally considered home cooking, and fettuccine Alfredo is generally scoffed at by Italian writers.\nServing fettuccine with butter and cheese was first mentioned in a 15th-century recipe for maccaroni romaneschi (\"Roman pasta\") by Martino da Como, a northern Italian cook active in Rome; the recipe cooks the pasta in broth or water and adds butter, \"good cheese\" (the variety is not specified) and \"sweet spices\".\nModern fettuccine Alfredo was invented by Alfredo di Lelio in Rome. According to family accounts, in 1892 Alfredo di Lelio began to work in a restaurant that was located in piazza Rosa and run by his mother Angelina. Di Lelio invented \"fettuccine al triplo burro\" (later named \"fettuccine all'Alfredo\" or \"fettuccine Alfredo\") in 1907 or 1908 in an effort to entice his wife, Ines, to eat after giving birth to their first child Armando. Alfredo added extra butter or \"triplo burro\" to the fettuccine when mixing it together for her. Piazza Rosa disappeared in 1910 following the construction of the Galleria Colonna/Sordi, and the restaurant was forced to close. Di Lelio later opened his own restaurant, Alfredo alla Scrofa, then called \"Alfredo\", in 1914 on the via della Scrofa in central Rome.\nThe fame of Alfredo's fettuccine spread, first in Rome and then to other countries. Di Lelio was made a Cavaliere dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia.\nIn 1943, during the war, di Lelio sold the restaurant to two of his waiters. In 1950, with his son Armando, Alfredo di Lelio opened a new restaurant in piazza Augusto Imperatore, Alfredo all'Augusteo, now managed by his niece Ines Di Lelio, bringing along the famous \"gold cutlery\" said to have been donated in 1927 by the American actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks in gratitude for Alfredo's hospitality. The two restaurants competed vigorously, with escalating puffery: \"the king of fettuccine\", \"the real king of fettuccine\", \"the magician of fettuccine\", \"the emperor of fettuccine\", \"the real Alfredo\", etc.\nAlfredo's fettuccine has long been popular with Americans. By 1922, it was already being reported on by American travelers. Multiple magazine articles and guidebooks in the 1920s and 1930s extolled Alfredo's noodles. In 1927, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks supposedly dined at Alfredo's and gave him the famous gold fork and spoon. Also in 1927, the American restaurateur and writer George Rector wrote up Alfredo's fettuccine and described the ceremony of its tableside preparation, accompanied by violin music, in detail; he did not give it a specific name, nor mention golden tableware.\nIn the 1950s, di Lelio promoted the dish and his restaurant by creating a photo gallery of visiting celebrities with his noodles, including Jimmy Stewart, Bob Hope, Anthony Quinn, Bing Crosby, Gary Cooper, Jack Lemmon, Ava Gardner, Tyrone Power, Sophia Loren, Cantinflas, and many others.\nIn 1966, the Pennsylvania Dutch Noodle Company started marketing their dried \"Fettuccine Egg Noodles\", which included a recipe on the package for an Alfredo sauce including cream and Swiss cheese as well as Parmesan and butter.\nThe American restaurant casual dining chain Olive Garden has popularized its versions of fettuccine alfredo, which may be combined with chicken, shrimp, or other foods to make main courses called \"chicken alfredo\", \"seafood alfredo\", etc. Given the strict separation of pasta and meat dishes in the usual Italian restaurant cuisine, this was never done by di Lelio. Olive Garden's recipe also includes cream and garlic.\nAlfredo sauce is often sold as a convenience food in grocery stores in many countries.

Stromboli is a type of turnover filled with various Italian cheeses (typically mozzarella) and usually Italian cold cuts (typically Italian meats such as salami, capocollo and bresaola) or vegetables. The dough used is either Italian bread dough or pizza dough. Stromboli was invented by Italian-Americans in the United States in suburban Philadelphia. The name of the dish is taken from the 1950 film Stromboli, which in turn is named after a volcanic island off the coast of Sicily.\nA stromboli is similar to a calzone, and the two are sometimes confused. Unlike calzones, which are always stuffed and folded into a crescent shape, a stromboli is typically rolled or folded into a cylinder, and may sometimes contain a thin layer of tomato sauce on the inside.\nThere are several claims regarding the origin of the usage of the name stromboli for food in the United States.\nRomano's Italian Restaurant & Pizzeria claims to have first used the name in 1950 in Essington, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, courtesy of Nazzareno Romano, an Italian immigrant. The pizzeria owner had experimented with \"pizza imbottita\", or \"stuffed pizza\", and added ham, cotechino sausage, cheese and peppers into a pocket of bread dough. His future brother-in-law suggested he name it after the recently released movie Stromboli, notorious for an off-screen affair between married actress, Ingrid Bergman, and married director, Roberto Rossellini, resulting in a love child.\nIn 1954, Mike Aquino of Mike's Burger Royal in Spokane, Washington, says he also named a turnover after the same movie. However, Aquino's version appears to only share the same name as the commonly accepted version of the stromboli and is significantly different from the Philadelphia turnover version that is usually defined as a \"stromboli\". Aquino's \"stromboli\" consists of capicola ham and provolone cheese covered in an Italian chili sauce on a French bread roll.

U' pastizz 'rtunnar, commonly known as pastizz, is a baked turnover with a savoury filling, typical of the Italian Basilicata region.\nIt is a Lucanian dialect noun, roughly translated in \"The pastry of Rotondella\", where the product originated from. It should not be confused with the Maltese pastizz.\nIt is a type of calzone, originated between the 18th and 19th century. It has felt the influence of other cultures over the time such as Albanians, who enriched the local cuisine with their flavors and elements. By tradition, pastizz was prepared in particular events of the year (pig slaughter, Easter and the celebration of Saint Mary of Anglona), when the availability of meat was increased. The half-moon shape is linked to a symbolism that refers to the concepts of female fertility and prosperity and recalls that of a large womb that holds nutritious elements. Today it can be found at bakeries, restaurants, and pizzerias, although homemade tradition is still common.\nCalzone\nCuisine of Basilicata\nPanzerotti\n\"U' Pastizz 'Rtunnar Calzone\". fondazioneslowfood.com.

Haggis pakora is a Scottish snack food that combines traditional Scottish haggis ingredients with the spices, batter and preparation method of Indian pakoras. It has become a popular food in Indian restaurants in Scotland, and is also available in prepared form in supermarkets.\nHaggis pakora has been described as a \"highly improbable Indo-Caledonian alliance making use of the Scots' most potent culinary weapons: sheep pluck (heart, liver and lungs) and deep-fat frying\" It has more fondly been called \"an inspired example of Indo-Gael fusion\". Haggis pakoras are just one of the many haggis fusion foods that have arisen in recent years. Others include haggis samosas, haggis spring rolls, haggis lasagne and haggis quesadillas. Often these use vegetarian haggis rather than the traditional haggis made from a sheep's stomach stuffed with the chopped up lung, heart and liver of the sheep mixed with oatmeal.\nThe dish appears to have been the creation of the Sikh community during a Scottish Mela held at the SEC in 1992-3, where with collaboration with the Exec. Chef at the time Bill McMeekin, he was asked for ideas on how to combine Scottish produce and Indian culinary influences. During some practical experiments, it was found that haggis could be used in the same way as other pakora ingredients. Haggis pakoras have become popular appetizers in Indian restaurants in Scotland, where they appeal to the national predilection for deep-fried food. In 2013 it was reported that a Greenock meat products company had launched prepared haggis pakoras. The product had won the  Best Innovative Product prize at the BPEX Foodservice Awards 2013. The Scottish celebrity chef Tony Singh served haggis pakora at a pop-up restaurant during the 2015 Edinburgh Festival.\nCalories for a prepared brand, consisting of protein 16.4g, carbohydrates 17.5g, fat 2.1g. \nA haggis, neeps and tatties pasty was submitted for the 2016 World Pasty Championships. \nBPEX, the British Pig Executive, is now AHDB Pork, a division of the UK's Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.\nList of deep fried foods\nList of Indian dishes\nBhaji\nBread pakora\u00a0\u2013 An Indian fried snack\nPakora\u00a0\u2013 Fritter from the Indian subcontinent\nSamosa\u00a0\u2013 Fried or baked pastry with a savory filling\nVada\u00a0\u2013 Category of savoury fried snacks from India\nCalories in Mrs Unis Haggis Pakora.\nEyewitness Travel 2011, p.\u00a023.\nMcGovern 2012, PT85.\nLester Haines 2012.\nIain Banks 2013, p.\u00a0265.\nShaheen 2010.\nNeil Shaw 2016.\nFelicity Cloake 2014.\nAbout AHDB Pork.\nEric Baxter 2013.\nThe Boys Eat Scotland 2015.\nPhilip Allan 2014.\nGeoff Matthews 2015.\n\"About AHDB Pork\".
