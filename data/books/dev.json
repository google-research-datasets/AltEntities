After the Second Civil War was fought over abortion, a compromise was reached, allowing parents to sign an order for their children between the ages of 13 and 18 to be \"unwound\"  taken to \"harvest camps\" and dissected into their body parts for later use. The reasoning is that, since 99.44% of the body is used, unwinds do not technically die because their individual body parts live on. Unwind received positive reviews upon release, with praise focusing on the novel's immersive environment and sociological implications. It received the Best Book for Young Adults award. ...",

In response, the government fought against both sides to stop the war from escalating and closed down schools and other services for children in order to do so. Children, teenagers, and young adults began protesting and rioting against the actions and nearly toppled the government in an event known as the Teen Uprising. At the same time, technology in organ transplants advanced into a process known as \"unwinding\"; organs and body parts can be harvested from any acceptable body and used by other bodies without rejection.\nAs a way to end the war, the government passed a set of amendments known as The Bill of Life. Abortion is banned, \"storking\" (the act of abandoning newborn babies to be left in someone else's care) becomes an accepted practice, and the Unwind Accord allows families to have their children between ages of 13 and 18 undergo unwinding as an option. Unwinding is justified as legal because the patient is kept alive during the entire process and roughly 99% of the body is harvested. Many parents use it to get rid of unwanted children who have reached their teenage years.\nThe story centers around three teenagers who have been scheduled to be unwound: Connor Lassiter, Risa Ward, and Levi \"Lev\" Jedediah Calder.\nConnor is a sixteen-year-old delinquent who discovers his parents signed an order to get him unwound. When his attempt at running away gets him cornered by a Juvey-cop, a law-enforcement officer who serves to round up teenagers signed to be unwound, he holds another teenager hostage, shoots the cop with his own tranquilizer gun, and causes a massive pile up. Connor's action gave him the name \"Akron AWOL\" and earns him the reputation of being the runaway who took down a police officer. At the same time, Risa, a fifteen-year-old orphan on her way to becoming unwound in order to cut her orphanage's costs, uses the jam to escape from the bus she was traveling on. Lev, a thirteen-year-old who was raised to believe it was his duty to be a \"tithe\" (chosen member to be unwound as an act of charity or service to a religion) for his family, is also on his way to be unwound and is the teenager who was held hostage. He is then abducted after being tranquilized. Connor and Risa escape the scene with Lev being forced to follow.\nConnor picks up a storked newborn girl after remembering a past experience his family had with storking. Risa grudgingly agrees to take the baby in with the group after they are caught holding her. The three enter a nearby high school to hide, and Lev attempts to escape by turning himself and the other two in to the school authorities. Feeling guilty about his actions, Lev decides to escape and pulls the fire alarm to help the other two escape as the police begin to arrive. Risa and Connor are found by a school teacher named Hannah, who helps them escape and tells them to find an antique store owner named Sonia. Sonia runs a safe house for runaway teenagers signed to be unwound. There, Connor and Risa meet Hayden Upchurch, a teen whose parents decided to have him unwound rather than choose who can have custody over him; Mai, a girl whose parents signed her due to the excess of girls in her family; Zachary, who is nicknamed \"Mouth Breather\" due to his asthma; and Roland Taggart, a bully with a tiger shark tattoo. Before the group is to be shuttled to the next safe house, Sonia has each teenager write a letter to someone they love. The letters would be sent a year after their eighteenth birthday if they were not picked up. Hannah decides to adopt the newborn girl, and the group was sent to a warehouse that serves as another safe house.\nMeanwhile, Lev encounters another teenager named Cyrus \"CyFi\" Finch, who teaches Lev street smarts. Lev learns that CyFi struggles to find closure with his actions, which has caused him to run away and engage in delinquent activities such as stealing. The struggle comes from Tyler Walker, an unwound teenager who has part of his brain in CyFi and is unaware that he has been unwound. As a result, CyFi constantly engages in Tyler's old habits and experiences Tyler's emotions sporadically. Lev helps CyFi and Tyler find peace by"

Azalea, the Princess Royale, is tasked with hosting the annual Yuletide ball the royal family holds on Christmas Eve. The Queen, who is heavily pregnant and ill, summons Azalea to her room to give her a silver handkerchief and make her swear on it to take care of her sisters. At the ball, Azalea meets a young Lord Bradford and quickly warms up to him. Her ten sisters, who are all too young to attend, sneak in and watch the event, a sisterly tradition. The ball is abruptly ended by Prime Minister Fairweller, without explanation, and the girls are sent to their room.\nThe next morning Fairweller informs the princesses their mother died in the night, giving birth to their twelfth sister, Lily. As per tradition, the entire royal family are to go into mourning for a year. The princesses feel suffocated by all the restrictions, especially the one on dancing, which was their favorite pastime. The King goes off to war right after the funeral, leading the girls to wonder if he even loves them.\nMonths later, Azalea discovers a D'Eathe mark, a remnant of when the kingdom was ruled by the insane High King of D'Eathe, which can reveal secret rooms and passageways when rubbed with something silver, in the girls' bedroom. She rubs the handkerchief on it, revealing a passage with a staircase leading downwards. She wakes the other girls and they all descend. At the bottom they find a forest of silver trees and a pavilion full of enchanted dancers. They interrupt the party and the dancers disappear. The owner of the pavilion introduces himself as the Keeper, and explains he was part of the legendary High King's court, but rebelled and was trapped within the castle as punishment. He allows the princesses to dance to their hearts' content, and invites them to return every night until mourning is over.\nEvery night the girls dance so much that they wear through their slippers. They're often tired in the morning and late to lessons and breakfast, and constantly stitching up their tattered shoes. When the King returns from war he discovers the girls have been dancing at night, although he doesn't know where. Remembering the Queen's handkerchief and how magical it felt, Azalea makes her sisters all promise on it to never tell anyone about the pavilion. With no other choice, the King allows the girls to continue dancing, provided they don't speak about it in front of him.\nOne night, the Keeper tells the princesses a story about the High King drinking a goblet of blood and swearing an oath on it to not die until he's killed the Captain General. In the morning Azalea realizes that their watch is missing and goes back to retrieve it. Keeper reveals he's been stealing from them, and refuses to give their things back until they find the magic object that's keeping him confined within the walls of the castle. Azalea suspects the castle's magic sugar teeth, which have been around since The High King was alive.\nThe princesses start a castle-wide hunt for them, which proves fruitless. Meanwhile, the King puts an advertisement in the newspaper inviting gentlemen to stay at the castle for two days to try and solve the riddle of where the princesses dance at night. The girls are furious, but quickly realize it's only an attempt to skirt around mourning rules and get them meeting potential suitors. All of which prove to be stuck up, boring, or obnoxious.\nKeeper once again steals from the girls, this time their mother's brooch. Azalea storms down to the pavilion upon discovering this, and tells him they're never going to come again, having realized Keeper is not as charming as he first appeared. The exit is magically blocked and the pavilion erupts into a wild and violent masquerade ball. As Azalea is being thrown about she sees the soul of her dead mother, leading her to realize Keeper is the High King. He tells her that he'll only release her mother if she finds the object trapping him, and then produces the sugar teeth. Azalea decides not to tell her sisters, suspecting Keeper can spy on them somehow.\nAzalea Kathryn Wentworth: Azalea is the main protagonist of the book and the eldest of the twelve sisters, at sixteen, and the Princess Royale. As eldest, she steps into the role as leader and surrogate-parent to the girls after their mother dies. She is fiercely protective of her family and naturally takes on responsibility. She's a talented dancer and loves dancing the most out of all of them, frequently using it as a way to make herself feel better. As Princess Royale, she's resigned to having an arranged marriage, since her choice is limited by the approval of both her father and parliament. Over the course of the book she"

The Children of H\u00farin is an epic fantasy novel which forms the completion of a tale by J. R. R. Tolkien. He wrote the original version of the story in the late 1910s, revised it several times later, but did not complete it before his death in 1973. His son, Christopher Tolkien, edited the manuscripts to form a consistent narrative, and published it in 2007 as an independent work. The book contains 33 illustrations by Alan Lee, eight of which are full-page and in colour.  The story is one of three \"great tales\" set in the First Age of Tolkien's Middle-earth, the other two being Beren and L\u00fathien and The Fall of Gondolin.\nThe history and descent of the main characters are given as the leading paragraphs of the book, and the back story is elaborated upon in The Silmarillion. It begins five hundred years before the action of the book, when Morgoth, a Vala and the prime evil power, escapes from the Blessed Realm of Valinor to the north-west of Middle-earth. From his fortress of Angband he endeavours to gain control of the whole of Middle-earth, unleashing a war with the Elves that dwell in the land of Beleriand to the south.\nHowever, the Elves manage to stay his assault, and most of their realms remain unconquered; one of the most powerful of these is Doriath, ruled by Thingol. In addition, after some time the Noldorin Elves forsake Valinor and pursue Morgoth to Middle-earth in order to take vengeance upon him. Together with the Sindar of Beleriand, they proceed to lay siege to Angband, and establish new strongholds and realms in Middle-earth, including Hithlum ruled by Fingon, Nargothrond by Finrod Felagund and Gondolin by Turgon.\n\nThree centuries pass, during which the first Men appear in Beleriand. These are the Edain, descendants of those Men who have rebelled against the rule of Morgoth's servants and journeyed westward. Most of the Elves welcome them, and they are given fiefs throughout Beleriand. The House of B\u00ebor rules over the land of Ladros, the Folk of Haleth retreat to the forest of Brethil, and the lordship of Dor-l\u00f3min is granted to the House of Hador. Later, other Men enter Beleriand, the Easterlings, many of whom are in secret league with Morgoth.\nEventually Morgoth manages to break the Siege of Angband in the Battle of Sudden Flame. The House of B\u00ebor is destroyed and the Elves and Edain suffer heavy losses; however, many realms remain unconquered, including Dor-l\u00f3min, where the lordship has passed to H\u00farin Thalion.\nThe Children of H\u00farin was published on 17 April 2007, by HarperCollins in the United Kingdom and Canada, and by Houghton Mifflin in the United States. Alan Lee, illustrator of other fantasy works by J. R. R. Tolkien (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings) created the jacket painting, as well as the illustrations within the book. Christopher Tolkien also included an excursus on the evolution of the tale, several genealogical tables, and a redrawn map of Beleriand.\nJ.R.R. Tolkien wrote that the setting is intended to be our Earth several thousand years ago, although the geographical and historical correspondence with the real world is tenuous. The lands of Middle-earth were populated by Men and other humanoid races: Elves, Dwarves, and Orcs, as well as divine beings, Valar and  Maiar. The story concentrates on a man of the House of Hador, T\u00farin Turambar, and his sister Ni\u00ebnor N\u00edniel, who are cursed along with their father H\u00farin by the Dark Lord Morgoth. The events take place more than 6,500 years before the War of the Ring.\nAccording to the Tolkien Estate:\nThe Children of H\u00farin takes the reader back to a time long before The Lord of the Rings, in an area of Middle-earth that was to be drowned before Hobbits appeared, and when the great enemy was still the fallen Vala, Morgoth, and Sauron was only Morgoth's lieutenant. This heroic romance is the tale of the Man, H\u00farin, who dared to defy Morgoth, and his family's tragic destiny, as it follows his son T\u00farin Turambar's travels through the lost world of Beleriand...\nThe story is mainly based on the legend of Kullervo, a character from the Finnish folklore poems known as Kalevala. Tolkien drew inspiration from the Kalevala for \"The Story of Kullervo\" in 1914, which was to become the model for his tale of T\u00farin. T\u00farin also resembles Sigmund, the father of Sigurd in the Volsunga saga, in the incestuous"

Original Sin is a 1994 detective novel in the Adam Dalgliesh series by P. D. James. It is set in London, mainly in Wapping in the Borough of Tower Hamlets, and centers on the city's oldest publishing house, Peverell Press, headquartered in a mock-Venetian palace on the River Thames.\nIn a 1995 book review for The New York Times, Michael Malone wrote \"Lady James, a novelist of broad gifts and great skill, here is writing in full mastery of her craft and in full indulgence of her predilections. The staples to which we have become accustomed are all present in force, including the textually rich details of architecture and furnishings that at times work in support of the story, and at other times seem to emerge from the author's compulsion to describe all that her eye has seen, whether that is an Anglo-Celtic church on Blackwater estuary or the cool bare lines of a modern flat in the Barbican. As ever, Lady James, the grande dame of fictional forensic pathology, vividly renders the ugly reality of violent death: the smell of a corpse, the look of an autopsy in a sterile post-mortem room, the random residue of lives abruptly stopped.\" Conversely, Iain Sinclair reviewed the book for the London Review of Books and wrote \"This is an empty set, a set defined by its architecture... An increasingly silly catalogue of deaths and suicides announces the final surrender of the Golden Age Murder Mystery: Agatha Christie force-fed on Pevsner and the humbug of Kenneth Baker\u2019s latest flag-waving anthology.

Evelina, or the History of a Young Lady's Entrance into the World  is a novel written by English author Fanny Burney and first published in 1778. Although published anonymously, its authorship was revealed by the poet George Huddesford in what Burney called a \"vile poem\".\nIn this 3-volume epistolary novel, title character Evelina is the unacknowledged but legitimate daughter of a dissipated English aristocrat, and thusly raised in rural seclusion until her 17th year. Through a series of humorous events that take place in London and the resort town of Hotwells, near Bristol, Evelina learns to navigate the complex layers of 18th-century society and come under the eye of a distinguished nobleman with whom a romantic relationship is formed in the latter part of the novel. This sentimental novel, which has notions of sensibility and early romanticism, satirizes the society in which it is set and is a significant precursor to the work of Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth, whose novels explore many of the same issues.\nMiss Evelina Anville, the novel's main character, is the daughter of Lady Caroline Belmont (born Caroline Evelyn) and Sir John Belmont. A series of letters convey the story, and she summarizes specific experiences of her life, mainly to her guardian/pseudo-father Reverend Villars. She embodies the desirable traits for women at the time. Although she is called a social \"nobody\" by the fop Mr. Lovel, other characters have high opinions of her. She is deemed \"a very pretty modest-looking girl\" by Lord Orville and an \"angel\" by Sir Clement in the first volume. The novel traces her trials and tribulations and growing confidence in her own abilities and discernment.\nReverend Arthur Villars is the man who raised Evelina as his own and refers to her as the \"child of his heart.\" He is her tutor and guardian, as well as Evelina's father figure in the novel. Taking in the disgraced Lady Belmont (Caroline), he vowed to be the protector of her child. He is Evelina's moral guide and confidant throughout the novel.\nSir Clement Willoughby is a minor nobleman (baronet). Evelina meets him at the infamous Ridotto during her first visit to London. A steadfast pursuer of Evelina's good favour, he courts her very forwardly with flamboyant proclamations and flattering speeches. Evelina dislikes him, only tolerating him because he curries favour with Captain Mirvan and Mrs. Selwyn. He also accompanies Captain Mirvan whenever he assaults, provokes, or teases Madame Duval.\nLord Orville is a  fine gentleman and earl who rescues Evelina on several occasions, including from the advances of Sir Clement. He falls into her good graces simply by conducting himself in a manner befitting his rank and person. He is open, engaging, gentle, attentive, and expressive.\nCaptain Mirvan is a retired navy captain who despises foreigners and constantly annoys Madame Duval. Husband of Mrs. Mirvan and father of Maria, he sometimes greatly embarrasses his family (or so Evelina perceives).\nMrs. Mirvan is a woman who shows much compassion and concern for Evelina. She looks after her during her visits to London and Howard Grove, treating Evelina as her second child.\nMiss Maria Mirvan is a childhood friend of Evelina's, her true companion and confidante.\nMme Duval is Evelina's English grandmother, who pretends to be French. She wants to take Evelina to France, away from English influence in general and Rev. Villars in particular. She is stubborn and ignorant; therefore, she is repugnant to Evelina.\nM. Dubois is Madame Duval's companion. He speaks only French and some broken English. Evelina bonds with him during her second residence in London because comparisons to her lowly Branghton cousins elevate her opinion of him. Unfortunately, this encourages him to make unwanted advances that infuriate Mme Duval. Captain Mirvan nicknames him \"Monseer Slippery\" because he once slipped in mud while carrying Mme Duval.\nThe Branghtons are Evelina's London relations, a mercantile family who own a silversmith's shop in High Holborn. Evelina must associate with them on her second visit to London; she grows impatient with their crass behaviour and is embarrassed to be thought of as in their party, especially when she meets Lord Orville in their company. The Misses Branghton are jealous of the attention their own beaux give Evelina; their brother eventually attempts, unsuccessfully, to propose to Evelina through Mme Duval.\nMr. Macartney is an impoverished Scottish poet who boards with the Branghtons and is the butt of many of their contemptuous jokes. Evelina rescues him during what she perceives to be a suicide attempt; he later"

Shadow is an ex-convict who is released from prison three days early when his wife Laura is killed in a car accident. Shadow is devastated by her death, and is distraught to learn that she died alongside his best friend Robbie, with whom she had been having an affair. He takes a job as a bodyguard for a mysterious con man, Mr. Wednesday, and travels with him across America, visiting Wednesday's acquaintances. Shadow learns that Wednesday is an incarnation of Odin the All-Father, and that he is recruiting American manifestations of the Old Gods, whose powers have waned as their believers have decreased in number, to participate in a battle against the New American Gods \u2013 manifestations of modern life and technology, such as the Internet, media, and modern means of transport. Shadow meets a leprechaun named Mad Sweeney, who gives Shadow a magical gold coin after Shadow beats him in a fight. Shadow later tosses the coin into his wife's grave at her funeral, inadvertently bringing her back from the dead as a semi-living revenant.\nThe New Gods abduct Shadow (utilizing a group of shadowy Men in Black, led by the mysterious Mr. World), but Laura rescues him, killing several Men in Black in the process. Wednesday hides Shadow, first with Mr. Ibis (Thoth) and Mr. Jacquel (Anubis), who run a funeral parlor in Cairo, Illinois, and then in the Wisconsin community of Lakeside. They are pursued all the while by the Men in Black, particularly Mr. Town, who blames Shadow for the death of his friends.\nThe New Gods seek to parley with Wednesday, but murder him at the meeting. This act galvanizes the Old Gods, and they rally to face their enemies in battle at Rock City. While retrieving Wednesday's body, Shadow is surprised to discover his old prison cellmate and mentor, Low Key Lyesmith, is working as a driver for the New Gods. Shadow is bound by his contract with Wednesday to hold his vigil by re-enacting Odin's time hanging from a \"World Tree\" while pierced by a spear for nine days. During these nine days, he is visited by Horus, who has become mad from living too long as a hawk. Shadow dies and visits the land of the dead, where he is judged by Anubis. Shadow learns that he is Wednesday's (Odin's) son, conceived as part of the deity's plans. During this time, Mr. Town arrives at the World Tree, ordered by Mr. World to cut a branch from it.\nHorus finds Easter and convinces her to bring Shadow back to life. Shadow realizes Mr. World is actually Low Key (Loki) Lyesmith, and that Odin and Loki have been working a \"two-man con\". They orchestrated Shadow's birth, his meeting of Loki in disguise in prison, and even Laura's death. Loki had arranged for Odin's murder, thus making the battle between the New and Old Gods a sacrifice to Odin, restoring Odin's power, while also allowing Loki to feed on the chaos of the battle.\nLaura chooses to hitchhike to Rock City and meets Mr. Town, who does not realize who she is, and they agree to travel together. During their travels, Laura learns who Mr. Town is and, once they arrive at their destination, kills him and takes the branch he took from the World Tree. She then meets with Loki and manages to stab him with the World Tree branch, which turns into a spear as she stabs.\nShadow arrives at Rock City and confronts Loki, now gravely wounded, and the ghost of Odin, who reveal their plans. Shadow travels to the site of the battle and explains that both sides have nothing to gain and everything to lose, with Odin and Loki as the only true winners. Shadow tells them the United States is a bad place for Gods, and he recommends they return home. The gods depart, Loki dies, and Odin's ghost fades. Laura asks Shadow to take the coin from her, which he does, and she finally dies.\nIn Iceland, Shadow meets another incarnation of Odin (created by the belief of the original settlers of Iceland), who is much closer than Wednesday to the Odin of mythology. Shadow accuses Odin of Wednesday's actions, but Odin retorts: \"He was me, yes. But I am not him.\" Shadow gives Wednesday's glass eye to Odin, which Odin places in a leather bag as a keepsake. Shadow performs a simple sleight-of-hand coin trick, which delights Odin, who asks for a repeat performance. Shadow then performs a small piece of real magic, pulling a golden coin from nowhere, before walking away from the god and out into the world.\n\"Shadow\" Moon \u2013 an ex-convict who becomes the reluctant"

Though the New York City Office of Emergency Management was responsible for coordinating the city's overall response in the aftermath of the World Trade Center collapse, the cleanup and recovery efforts at Ground Zero were quickly placed in the purview of the New York City Department of Design and Construction, a then-obscure Queens-based city agency that handled civic construction and permitting. From an elementary school in Battery Park City, DDC commissioner Ken Holden and deputy commissioner Mike Burton managed most of the day-to-day aspects of the site, along with an inner circle of consultants from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Leslie E. Robertson Associates (founded by the lead structural engineer of the Twin Towers), LZA/Thornton Tomasetti, Mueser Rutledge Consulting Engineers, and D.H. Griffin Companies, as well as representatives from the Fire Department of New York, New York Police Department, the Port Authority Police Department, and various other state, federal, and nonprofit organizations.\nUsing established contacts in the city's construction industry, the DDC split Ground Zero into four quadrants and assigned AMEC, Bovis Lend Lease, Tully Construction Company, and Turner Construction to oversee the cleanup of each quadrant, though the demarcation of the quadrants blurred as the removal process accelerated. Langewiesche details the demands and dangers of the work and its managerial challenges, as decisions were mostly made on the fly, particularly by Burton, due to the unprecedented and immense scale of the cleanup effort. Ultimately, 1.5 million tons of debris was removed from the site and barged by Weeks Marine or trucked to the recently-closed Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island, where it was searched for human remains or personal effects (such as the intact, expired identification card of Port Authority lead engineer and frequent DDC consultant Peter Rinaldi, which had been stored in his office on the 72nd floor of the North Tower and was found among rubble in Fresh Kills).\nThe book recounts the moments leading up to the crash of American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 into the Twin Towers, the factors that led to each building's collapse, and the key issues that arose during the cleanup effort, including fears that the site's slurry wall would fail and flood the 17-acre site to the possibility of industrial accident from excavators working atop the unstable debris pile. Langewiesche himself joined several excursions beneath The Pile where the management team assessed potential concerns, relating the journey to a ruined industrial chiller plant thought to contain a lethal amount of Freon at risk of escaping upward and quickly suffocating rescue workers as well as a search for leaks in the slurry wall. He also chronicles the tensions that arose around the site, from clashes between firefighters insistent on a methodical search of the ruins for their fallen brothers and the construction management teams who hoped to clear the site as fast as possible to the irreparable strain the cleanup effort put on Holden and Burton's professional relationship. By the end of the cleanup effort in mid-2002, several of the key players Langewiesche interviewed related a feeling of emptiness over the completion of the insular work at the site, having felt it was the most important of their lives. At the book's close, Langewiesche describes the fate of the 200,000 tons of structural steel used in the buildings, which was cut into blocks and shipped to China and India to be melted down for reuse.\nPraised for its matter-of-fact tone and detailed thoroughness, American Ground was listed as an essential book about the September 11 attacks and was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award. However, a passage about evidence of possible looting by firefighters prior to the collapse that was unearthed during the recovery effort was met with criticism and angry rebuttals upon the book's publication.

The book delves into the history of gardens at the White House, including First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's victory garden and Thomas Jefferson's attempts to grow a four-foot-long cucumber. Obama describes how the Kitchen Garden's Jefferson beds include a quote from the former president that is also a guiding principle for the garden: \"the failure of one thing repaired by the success of another; and instead of one harvest, a continued one throughout the year.\"\nAmerican Grown blends the first lady's personal gardening experiences with stories from the White House Kitchen Garden. Obama writes about the time in her life when she had \"no idea that tomatoes didn\u2019t come in green plastic trays, covered by cellophane, and that they could be any color other than pale red.\" The portion of the book devoted to the White House beehive describes how an apple tree in the Children's Garden produced fruit for the first time in 25 years after the introduction of bees. Through her research for the book, Obama discovered that her maternal grandmother tended a community victory garden in Chicago.\nA review in The New York Times to Obama's book \"charming and thought-provoking\", writer Dominique Browning also stating that the garden serves as a good example to call the country's attention to the connection between food quality and health.\nBurros, Marian (May 29, 2012). \"Michelle Obama Reveals How Her White House Garden Grows\".

Tom Swift and His Aerial Warship, or, The Naval Terror of the Seas, is Volume 18 in the original Tom Swift novel series published by Grosset & Dunlap.\nTom creates two new inventions for this story: a huge airship for military use, and a method of dealing with recoil on the weapons to be used.\nThe airship is built on a similar model as the German-built zeppelins. These are huge craft, Tom's measuring at 600 feet in length and 60 feet in diameter. It is built of a semi-rigid airbag with several separated gas compartments, which would permit lift even if one or more of the gas compartments was damaged. Three cabins are hung below the airship: at the front is the pilot house, in the middle is the general quarters, and at the rear is the engine. A non-flammable gas is used for lift, and a single gas-powered engine provides forward momentum. Storage batteries, coupled with an electric motor, are used as backup power in the event of main engine failure. Tom hoped to sell this to the United States government, with an eye on the hostilities occurring in Europe at the time of the story.\nSecondary to the airship, Tom needs to conceive of a way to neutralize recoil from the guns which he plans to mount: two 4-inch cannon, and several unspecified machine-guns. When fired, the cannon would generate enough recoil to rip the ship apart, but Tom is inspired by Ned's observation of how an automatic door closer operates. Tom's invention is similar to the recoil system used in the French 75mm field gun.\nTom Swift and His Aerial Warship e-text at Project Gutenberg\n Tom Swift public domain audiobook at LibriVox"

It is widely considered to be one of the most influential works of twentieth-century German literature.\nMann started writing what was to become The Magic Mountain in 1912. It began as a much shorter narrative which revisited in a comic manner aspects of Death in Venice, a novella that he was preparing for publication. The newer work reflected his experiences and impressions during a period when his wife, who was suffering from a lung complaint, resided at Dr. Friedrich Jessen's Waldsanatorium in Davos, Switzerland for several months. In May and June 1912, Mann visited her and became acquainted with the team of doctors and patients in this cosmopolitan institution. According to Mann, in the afterword that was later included in the English translation of his novel, this stay inspired his opening chapter (\"Arrival\").\nThe outbreak of World War I interrupted his work on the book. The savage conflict and its aftermath led the author to undertake a major re-examination of European bourgeois society. He explored the sources of the destructiveness displayed by much of civilised humanity. He was also drawn to speculate about more general questions related to personal attitudes to life, health, illness, sexuality and mortality. His political stance also changed during this period, from anti-republican to supporting Weimar republic. Given this, Mann felt compelled to radically revise and expand the pre-war text before completing it in 1924. Der Zauberberg was eventually published in two volumes by S. Fischer Verlag in Berlin.\nMann's vast composition is erudite, subtle, ambitious, but, most of all, ambiguous; since its original publication it has been subject to a variety of critical assessments. For example, the book blends a scrupulous realism with deeper symbolic undertones. Given this complexity, each reader is obliged to interpret the significance of the pattern of events in the narrative, a task made more difficult by the author's irony. Mann was well aware of his book's elusiveness, but offered few clues about approaches to the text. He later compared it to a symphonic work orchestrated with a number of themes. In a playful commentary on the problems of interpretation\u2014\"The Making of The Magic Mountain,\" written 25 years after the novel's original publication\u2014he recommended that those who wished to understand it should read it twice.\nThe Magic Mountain can be read both as a classic example of the European Bildungsroman \u2013 a \"novel of education\" or \"novel of formation\" \u2013 and as a sly parody of this genre. Many formal elements of this type of fiction are present: like the protagonist of a typical Bildungsroman, the immature Castorp leaves his home and learns about art, culture, politics, human frailty and love. Also embedded within this vast novel are extended reflections on the experience of time, music, nationalism, sociological issues and changes in the natural world. Castorp\u2019s stay in the rarefied air of The Magic Mountain provides him with a panoramic view of pre-war European civilization and its discontents.\nMann describes the subjective experience of serious illness and the gradual process of medical institutionalization. He also alludes to the irrational forces within the human psyche, at a time when Freudian psychoanalysis was becoming a prominent type of treatment. These themes relate to the development of Castorp's character over the time span covered by the novel. In his discussion of the work, written in English and published in The Atlantic January 1953, Mann states that \"what [Hans] came to understand is that one must go through the deep experience of sickness and death to arrive at a higher sanity and health . . . .\"\nMann acknowledged his debt to the skeptical insights of Friedrich Nietzsche concerning modern humanity, and he drew from these in creating discussion between the characters. Throughout the book the author employs the discussion with and between Settembrini, Naphta and the medical staff to introduce the young Castorp to a wide spectrum of competing ideologies about responses to the Age of Enlightenment. However, whereas the classical Bildungsroman would conclude by Castorp having formed into a mature member of society, with his own world view and greater self-knowledge, The Magic Mountain ends with Castorp becoming an anonymous conscript, one of millions, under fire on some battlefield of World War I.\n\nAccording to the author, he originally planned The"

An effective translation of a series that gives eye-opening glimpses into the lives of the comfortable middle-class in Germany between the world wars.\" Kirkus Review\nElse Ury (November 1, 1877 in Berlin; January 13, 1943 in the Auschwitz concentration camp) was a German writer and children's book author. Her best-known character is the blonde doctor's daughter Annemarie Braun, whose life from childhood to old age is told in the ten volumes of the highly successful Nesth\u00e4kchen series. The books, the six-part TV series Nesth\u00e4kchen (1983), based on the first three volumes, as well as the new DVD edition (2005) caught the attention of millions of readers and viewers.\nThe Nesth\u00e4kchen books represent a German literary genre, the Backfischroman, a girls' novel that describes maturation and was intended for readers 12\u201316 years old. A Backfisch (\u201cteenage girl\u201d, literally \u201cfish for frying\u201d) is a young girl between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The Backfischroman was in fashion between 1850 and 1950. It dealt overwhelmingly with stereotypes, traditional social images of growing girls absorbing societal norms. The stories ended in marriage, with the heroine becoming a Hausfrau. Among the most successful Backfischroman authors, beside Else Ury, were Magda Trott, Emmy von Rhoden with her Der Trotzkopf and Henny Koch. Ury intended to end the Nesth\u00e4kchen series with volume 6, Nesth\u00e4kchen Flies From the Nest, describing Nesth\u00e4kchen's marriage. Meidingers Jugendschriften Verlag, her Berlin publisher, was inundated with a flood of letters from Ury's young fans, begging for more Nesth\u00e4kchen stories. After some hesitation, Ury wrote four more Nesth\u00e4kchen volumes, and included comments about her initial doubts in an epilogue to volume 7, Nesth\u00e4kchen and Her Chicks.\nNesth\u00e4kchen Flies from the Nest on Google Books\nJennifer Redmann.

It established him as a major fantasy novelist and created the character of Druss, who would appear in several subsequent books. It was the first novel by Gemmell, and in The Drenai saga. Gemmell got the idea for the book in 1976. He was being tested for cancer, and to take his mind off it he tried writing a book, which he called \"Against the Hordes\". The fortress and its attackers, the Nadir, were metaphors for him and the cancer. In the end, he was found not to have cancer after all and he forgot about the book, which he claims wasn't very good anyway. However, in 1980, a friend of Gemmell's read the manuscript and told him that the story had potential. ...",

The Drenai Empire is under threat.  The tribal Nadir people have been united for the first time by the great warleader Ulric, who has forged a massive empire in the North.  The Drenai leader Abalayn is trying to negotiate new treaties with Ulric, but war is brewing and an over 500,000 strong Nadir army marches on the fortress of Dros Delnoch, gateway to the Drenai heartlands.  Dros Delnoch is the greatest fortress in the world, a narrow pass guarded by six high walls and a great keep, but under Abalayn its complement of defenders has been reduced to less than 10,000 men under the leadership of an unfit General.\nThe fate of the Drenai hinges on the defence of Dros Delnoch. If the fortress can hold the Nadir horde for three months, the Drenai general Magnus Woundweaver might be able to gather and train a Drenai army.  However, given the odds, no-one truly believes that Delnoch can be held.\nThe novel follows the stories of two men who find their destiny at Dros Delnoch.  Regnak Wanderer (Rek for short) an ex-army officer and natural 'baresark', seeing a war brewing, resigned his commission because he lacked the courage to risk his life and took to a life of wandering. Rek is an idealist and eventually he returns to Delnoch at the persuasion of the woman he falls in love with and finds his destiny as the Earl of Bronze. The other man is the greatest hero of the Drenai people - Druss the Legend. His death was foretold defending Delnoch and while given the choice to avoid it and fall into senility Druss (and his once possessed axe Snaga) marched to the great fortress to defend his people one last time. In this story Druss is in his sixties and much weaker than his prime but still a formidable warrior and an inspirational leader to the Drenai.\nThe story also flicks into the perspective of several defenders during different stages of the siege as time goes on. It also follows The Thirty, a group of 30 warrior priests of the light whose purpose is to fight and die (except for one priest that leaves to continue the order at the end of each great battle) for the greater good and their people, the Drenai.\nDruss the Legend is a hero embodying virtue, courage, honour, chivalry and strength of character. Druss is the grandson of Bardan the Slayer, a psychotic madman driven insane by the demon residing within his rune covered enchanted axe, Snaga the Sender (Druss later exorcised the demon while looking for his wife Rowena). Druss is described as a physically imposing man, immensely strong but also possessing great speed and dexterity. He has a hard, flat face, black hair and a thick, black beard and pale blue eyes. Despite his initial lack of formal combat training, he becomes known as a fearsome warrior who has never been bested in single combat. He wears the armour and weapons of his grandfather, which includes a black leather jerkin with silver steel pauldrons, black leather gauntlets with reinforced steel plates covering the knuckles and forearms, black leather boots and a black pot helmet with a silver axe motif on the brow flanked by small silver skulls. Druss was the main protagonist in Gemmell's first novel, Legend, however chronologically his story begins in The First Chronicles of Druss the Legend and is continued in The Legend of Deathwalker. Having died in Legend, Druss reappears in The Swords of Night and Day, both as a spirit wandering in the darkness, and in physical form by possessing his clone. In October 2000 at the World Fantasy Convention in Texas, David Gemmell gave an interview in which he revealed that Druss was based on his stepfather, Bill. \"Years later, when I wrote my first novel, I used Bill as the model for a character. His name was Druss the Legend. Bill re-appeared in many novels thereafter, in many guises.\"\nhttps://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/6571/ZX-Spectrum/Legend\n\"Archived copy\".

P. Putnam's Sons, Penguin Books. series: Legend series. Legend is set in a future flooded, fortified Los Angeles, ruled by the totalitarian Republic of America. The novel centers around Day (Daniel Altan Wing) and June Iparis, two 15-year-olds on opposite sides of the economic spectrum. June Iparis is a military prodigy, born into an elite family, and groomed for success in the Republic's highest circles. She is the only person to have ever scored full marks on the Trial, a comprehensive test administered at age 10 to determine the child's future role in society. Her parents died several years before the start of the story, so she is raised by her older brother Metias. Daniel \"Day\" Wing is an infamous wanted criminal, born in the impoverished slums of the Republic. His family believes he is dead, apart from his older brother John.\nDay learns that his younger brother, Eden, is infected with the Plague, a disease that periodically ravages sectors of the Republic. Day breaks into the city hospital to steal medicine and escapes after a confrontation with Metias. Later that night, June is informed by Thomas, an officer in the Republic and Metias's childhood friend, that her brother is dead and that Day is the killer. June graduates early from her military university and sets out to catch Day. Using the promise of a cure for Eden's infection, she lures Day to the site of one of his previous heist locations, and they converse, albeit not face-to-face before Day realizes she is a Republic agent and June infers his home sector by recognizing his accent.\nJune watches the interrogation of a spy from the Colonies, another North American country in perpetual war with the Republic. She is appalled by the violent beating delivered by Thomas. June poses as a street urchin and goes searching for Day. She gets in a street fight, stepping in for a young girl named Tess, and beats the previous champion, Kaede. June is stabbed in the process. Day rescues June, unaware of her identity, and Tess, a friend of Day's, sets about healing June. Day and June begin to develop romantic feelings for each other, but June realizes who he is and reports his family's location to Thomas and the Republic. Day attempts to defend his family's house from Republic soldiers, but Thomas kills his mother and Day is captured by June's commanding officer, Commander Jameson. Thomas congratulates a horrified June on a job well done.\nJune questions Day on his long list of crimes; Day insists he is innocent of Metias's murder. June reviews Day's files and discovers he got a perfect score on the Trial, like June herself. However, instead of Day being celebrated as a prodigy, the Republic falsified records to indicate Day failed his Trial and died in a labor camp. While Day is being moved to a new cell, he sees evidence that the Republic is intentionally spreading the Plague. Day is further tortured by Commander Jameson and sentenced to death.\nJune informs Day that John is in a cell and Eden has been sent to labs on the war front. Day tells June about painful tests inflicted on him after supposedly failing the Trial. Children sent to \"work camps\" are actually killed or used for experimentation in laboratories; Day escaped after being left for dead. Day tells June his theory about the origins of the Plague. Later, protestors gather in support of Day; June watches Thomas order his soldiers to fire on the protestors.\nDay is interrogated by Thomas and learns that Kaede, the girl beaten in a street fight by June, is a Patriot spy; the Patriots are a rebel group connected with the Colonies. That night, June determines that Metias was actually murdered by Thomas, under the orders of Commander Jameson. Metias left a coded message for June, revealing that their parents were murdered for discovering the true purposes of the Plague: a method of culling the weaker Republic populations, and a biological weapon against the Colonies. Day learns that Eden was the index case for a new Plague strain. June decides to break Day and John out, and she goes to meet with Kaede to strike a deal with the Patriots.\nJune and the Patriots plot an escape plan, but Jameson moves up the execution date. June attempts to rescue Day and John on her own but is arrested by Thomas. Their confrontation is halted by attacking Patriots, and June escapes with Day in the chaos; John sacrifices himself to allow June and Day to escape, and the Republic, having mistaken John for Day, claims that Day has been executed.

The novel opens as the family is ordering at the drive-through of a fictional Double-Back Burger (the colors and logos of which are based on In-N-Out Burger) before leaving southern California for Bah\u00eda de la Luna.\nAs the sisters are exploring Bah\u00eda de la Luna, they are surprised by a boy named Carlos Calaveras, who turns out to be one of their new neighbors. Catrina and Maya explore their Mexican heritage with the help of Carlos, culminating in a Dia de los Muertos celebration in November.\nThe magical realism of Ghosts marks a sharp change from Telgemeier's earlier works, which have been autobiographical (Smile [2010]; Sisters [2014]) or realistic fiction (Drama [2012]). Instead, Telgemeier depicts the titular ghosts as real but benevolent presences to help Catrina understand death and deal with Maya's terminal illness.\nTelgemeier stated she was inspired to write Ghosts in part by the death of her young cousin Sabina, who died from cancer at the age of 13. The scenes from the Day of the Dead celebration were left blank in the initial manuscript submitted to Scholastic. Telgemeier waited until she had attended a Day of the Dead celebration in San Francisco to accurately express her experience in the story, which she later called \"one of the most moving nights of my life.\"\nAspects of the town of Bah\u00eda de la Luna are inspired by Half Moon Bay, Moss Beach, Monterey, Morro Bay, and Santa Cruz.\nThe panels were colored by Braden Lamb.\nThe book received positive reviews. Dan Kois, reviewing for The New York Times called it \"a typically empathetic and complex work from a gifted comics creator\". Kirkus Reviews said Telgemeier showed \"superior visual storytelling\" in keeping readers \"emotinally [sic] engaged and unable to put down this compelling tale\". According to School Library Journal, it is a \"can't miss-addition to middle grade graphic novel shelves\".\nIn 2017, Ghosts won an Eisner Award for Best Publication for Kids (ages 9\u201312) and the Dwayne McDuffie Award for Kids' Comics.\nAs of 2017 the paperback version had spent several weeks on The New York Times Best Sellers list under the category \"Paperback Graphic Books.\"\nAfter the novel was published, several readers pointed out the cultural appropriation of Dia de los Muertos as well as the problematic sanitized portrayal of the history of Spanish missions in California. Telgemeier responded by posting a short essay acknowledging the critical viewpoints on her website.\nLarson, Sarah (13 September 2016). \"\"Ghosts\": Raina Telegemeier returns\". The New Yorker.

H. Allen & Co.. The World Is Full of Married Men is the debut novel of British author Jackie Collins, first published in 1968 by W. H. Allen & Co..\nWithout a literary agent but with the strong support and encouragement of her husband, Collins sent off the manuscript to a publisher. By this time, Jacqueline Susann's similarly themed novel Valley of the Dolls (1966) had already become a huge bestseller and a hit film, and Collins' novel was accepted. Within a week of its publication, The World Is Full of Married Men made the best-seller list. \nThe book was banned in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, but the scandal bolstered sales in the United Kingdom and the US.  Collins' publishers at the time, W. H. Allen & Co., told her that unless she took the \"four-letter words\" out, the book would be banned in Australia. Collins proceeded in taking the four-letter words out and it was still banned in Australia. In reaction, Collins quipped, \"What's the matter? Don't you have married men there?\"\nRomantic novelist Barbara Cartland called the book \"nasty, filthy and disgusting\", and charged Collins with \"creating every pervert in Britain\". When Collins sent a signed copy of the book to her father, Joe Collins, he stopped reading it after the first few pages. \"Jackie's racy style was altogether too much for me\", he later said and for the rest of his life he was never to read more than just a few pages of his daughter's racy pot-boilers. \"I am not a prude\", he said. \"I'm thick skinned and broad-minded and hard to shock (but it is) distasteful for a father to read his daughter's descriptions of sex.\"\nA film version of the novel was made in 1979, eleven years after the novel's publication. With a screenplay written by Collins herself, and co-produced by her husband Oscar Lerman, the film was made to capitalize on the success of The Stud and The Bitch, two of Collins' other novels made into films in 1978 and 1979. The film version was set in the late 1970s (as opposed to the novel's 1960s setting) and featured American stars Anthony Franciosa and Carroll Baker as David and Linda Cooper, and included Gareth Hunt, Anthony Steel, Paul Nicholas, Georgina Hale, John Nolan, Jean Gilpin, Alison Elliott, and Stephanie Marrian, the Sun Newspaper's first page 3 girl in supporting roles. Newcomer Sherri Lee Cronn was cast (as Claudia Parker) in her first and only role.\nDue to its setting, the film made much use of disco music and even featured an appearance by famed dance troupe Hot Gossip. The Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler had a UK Top 40 hit with the title track to the film, and also appeared in the film, performing the song during the opening credits. The song was also recorded by the American singer Bette Midler the same year.\nThe film version grossed $977,326 in the US.\nRoberts, Oliver (18 November 2007). \"Mistress of fiction\".

The book was dedicated to the Swiss journalist, travel writer and novelist Annemarie Schwarzenbach (1908\u20131942), whom McCullers had met and befriended in the summer of 1940 (after the book was finished).\nIt was adapted as a 1967 film of the same name, featuring Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando.\nMcCullers wrote the book in 1939, originally using the title \"Army Post\". She said the story had germinated when, as an adolescent, she had first stepped into the alien territory of Fort Benning in Georgia. A more direct inspiration came from a chance remark which her husband Reeves (an ex-soldier) made to her about a voyeur who had been arrested at Fort Bragg; a young soldier had been caught peeping inside the married officers' quarters.\nMcCullers wrote the novel while in Fayetteville, North Carolina, near Fort Bragg. After two months of arduous writing, she finished her manuscript and put it away in a dresser. She later said of it:\nI am so immersed in my characters that their motives are my own. When I write about a thief, I become one; when I write about Captain Penderton, I become a homosexual man. I become the characters I write about and I bless the Latin poet Terence who said 'Nothing human is alien to me.'\nAfter its publication in 1941, the novel caused some consternation in Columbus, Georgia and at Fort Benning, where people speculated about the source of McCullers' tale.\nAccording to author Michael Bronski, McCullers tackled the topics of \"homosexuality, sadism, voyeurism, and fetishism while exploring the boundaries of eroticism, outsider status and the fragility of normal in the novel.\"\nAnthony Slide, another 21st-century scholar, considers Reflections in a Golden Eye to be one of only four well-known gay novels in the English language in the first half of the 20th century. The other three are Djuna Barnes' Nightwood, Truman Capote's Other Voices, Other Rooms, and Gore Vidal's The City and the Pillar.\nA 1967 film adaptation of Reflections in a Golden Eye was directed by John Huston. It stars Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Julie Harris, Brian Keith and Robert Forster.\nNotes\nMcCullers, Carson (2005-04-05). The Mortgaged Heart: Selected Writings.

Trevor J. Constable and Raymond Toliver are American authors who produced 10 non-fiction books on the fighter aces of World War II. Toliver is a former U.S. Air Force pilot and official historian of the American Fighter Aces Association.\nThe Blond Knight of Germany was criticised by historians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies in their work The Myth of the Eastern Front as one of the key works that promoted the myth of the \"clean Wehrmacht\". They described the book as a \"hallmark of romanticization\", with its \"insidious\" title that suggested medieval chivalry that \"not only fails to characterize the conduct of the Wehrmacht during the Soviet-German war, but, indeed, marks its opposite\".  \nThe historian Klaus Schmider notes that the authors are \"sympathetic\" to Hartmann, and that the book \"tip[s] over into out-and-out hero worship\".\nThe historian Jens Wehner notes that the German-language version of the book, released in 1971 as Holt Hartmann vom Himmel! Die Geschichte des erfolgreichsten Jagdfliegers der Welt, was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in terms of presentation of historical realities. These included the uncritical borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the Fliegerasse (\"aces\") and stereotypes about the Soviet Union. According to Wehner, the latter could be traced to the prevailing attitudes during the Cold War. Further, the political and social consequences of World War II were completely ignored.\n\nParkinson 1966.\nSmelser & Davies 2008, pp.\u00a0170\u2013173.\nSchmider 2009.\nNotheisen 2017.\nLaura Notheisen (31 January 2017). \"So war der deutsche Landser.

The novella reflects Dostoevsky's own addiction to roulette, which was in more ways than one the inspiration for the book: Dostoevsky completed the novella in 1866 under a strict deadline to pay off gambling debts.\nThe Gambler treated a subject Fyodor Dostoevsky himself was familiar with: gambling. Fyodor Dostoevsky gambled for the first time at the tables at Wiesbaden in 1863. From that time till 1871, when his passion for gambling subsided, he played at Baden-Baden, Homburg, and Saxon-les-Bains frequently, often beginning by winning a small amount of money and losing far more in the end. He first mentions his interest in gambling in a letter he sent to his first wife's sister on 1 September 1863 describing his initial success:\nPlease do not think that, in my joy over not having lost, I am showing off by saying that I possess the secret of how to win instead of losing. I really do know the secret \u2014 it is terribly silly and simple, merely a matter of keeping oneself under constant control and never getting excited, no matter how the game shifts. That's all there is to it \u2014 you just can't lose that way and are sure to win.\nWithin a week he lost his winnings and was forced to beg his family for money. He wrote to his brother Mikhail on 8 September 1863:\nAnd I believed in my system\u00a0... within a quarter of an hour I won 600 francs. This whetted my appetite. Suddenly I started to lose, couldn't control myself and lost everything. After that I ... took my last money, and went to play ... I was carried away by this unusual good fortune and I risked all 35 napoleons and lost them all. I had 6 napoleons d'or left to pay the landlady and for the journey. In Geneva I pawned my watch.\nFyodor Dostoevsky then agreed to a hazardous contract with F. T. Stellovsky that if he did not deliver a novel of 12 or more signatures by 1 November 1866, Stellovsky would acquire the right to publish Dostoevsky's works for nine years, until 1 November 1875, without any compensation to the writer. He noted down parts of his story, then dictated them to one of the first stenographers in Russia and his wife-to-be, young Anna Grigorevna, who transcribed them and copied it neatly out for him. With her help, he was able to finish the book in time.\nIn order of appearance:\nChapter 1\nAlexei Ivanovich \u2013 The narrator of the story; nobleman, wiseacre. Tutor of The General's young children Nadjenka and Misha. Pathologically in love with Polina Alexandrovna: \"...two days ago on the Schlangenberg you challenged me, and I whispered: say the word and I'll jump into this abyss. If you had said the word then I would have jumped.\"\nThe General \u2013 Sagorjanski, 55, a widower, in love with Mlle Blanche. In thrall to the Marquis Des Grieux since the latter made up a shortfall in public funds that the general had to cover before he could hand over his government post.\nPolina Alexandrovna Praskovja \u2013 The General's stepdaughter. Spitefully manipulates the smitten narrator. Cares nothing for gambling.\nMaria Filippovna \u2013 The General's sister\nMarquis des Grieux \u2013 The \"little Frenchman\", called \"Monsieur le Comte\" by the servants. Pompous, holds forth about finance at the dinner table. Deeply concerned that The General receive his inheritance so that des Grieux can be repaid.\nMr. Astley \u2013 Englishman, nephew of Lord Piebrook, serves as a steadying influence on Alexei Ivanovich. \"I have never met a shyer man ... very nice and quiet\". Far wealthier than des Grieux.\nChapter 3\nMademoiselle Blanche de Cominges \u2013 The General's fianc\u00e9e, assumed to be a French noblewoman. About 25, \"tall and well built, with shapely shoulders ... her hair is black as ink, and there is a terrible amount of it, enough for two coiffures ... She dresses showily, richly, with chic, but with great taste\". Returns the attentions of The General only insofar as she is interested in his prospective inheritance.\nChapter 6\nBaroness Wurmerhelm \u2013 \"...short and extraordinarily fat, with a terribly fat, pendulous chin, so that her neck couldn't be seen at all.

Brewster's Millions is a comedic novel written by George Barr McCutcheon in 1902, originally under the pseudonym of Richard Greaves.\nThe plot concerns a young man whose grandfather leaves him $1 million in a will, but a competing will from another relative requires he must spend the $1 million in the first year or forfeit a $7 million inheritance from the other relative.\nIt was adapted into a play in 1906, which opened at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway, and the novel or play has been adapted into films thirteen times, four of which were produced in India.\n\nThe novel was adapted into a Broadway play of the same name by Winchell Smith and Byron Ongley. The play debuted at the New Amsterdam Theatre on December 31, 1906.\nOpening night principal cast:\nEdward Abeles \u2013 \tMontgomery Brewster\nLeslie Bassett \u2013\t \t Fred Gardner\nGaston Bell \u2013\t \t Horace Pettingill\nCecile Breton \u2013\t \t Trixie Clayton\nGeorge Clare \u2013\t \t Rawles\nJack Devereaux \u2013\tSubway Smith\nSumner Gard \u2013\t \t Archibald Vanderpool\nWillard Howe \u2013\t \t Frank Bragdon\nNestor Lennon \u2013  Colonel Drew\nEmily Lytton \u2013\t \t Mrs. Dan De Mille\nArthur Morris \u2013 \t Thomas\nOlive Murray \u2013\t \t Barbara Drew\nJosephine Park \u2013\t Janice Armstrong\nGeorge Probert \u2013\t Nopper Harrison\nEugene Redding \u2013\t Monsieur Bargie\nAlbert Sackett \u2013 \t Mr. Grant\nJoseph Woodburn \u2013\t Joseph MacCloud\nThe play was later adapted into a musical, Zip Goes a Million.\nThe novel Brewster's Millions has been adapted into many films:\nIn the TV episode \"Punky's Millions\", from the animated version of Punky Brewster, Punky and her father Henry appear on a TV show trying to win the $40 million prize. In order to claim the grand prize, they must spend one million dollars in 48 hours. To make sure that the money would not be spent all at once on something very expensive (e.g., a villa as suggested by one of Punky's friends), a rule states the money cannot be used to buy any single item for more than $10,000. Also, every single item purchased must be donated. When the deadline passes, Punky and Henry seem to have won, but one of Punky's friends, Allen, forgot to spend the 98 cents he got as change when he bought chocolate, so they lose the game. Fortunately, they had been donating their purchases to a local orphanage, and one of the dollars they spent was on a lottery ticket, which wins $100,000 for the orphanage.\nOn February 15, 1937, the Lux Radio Theatre presented a one-hour version of the play starring Jack Benny. The show was modified for Benny: the title character in this version is named Jack Benjamin Brewster; and the character opens the play's first scene by playing Benny's theme song, \"Love in Bloom\", on the violin.\nPlaying opposite Benny is his real-life wife and the co-star of his long-running radio show, Mary Livingstone. Livingstone plays Brewster's girlfriend, here called Mary Gray.\nThe casting of Benny as a character who must spend money was considered humorous in itself, as it contrasted sharply with Benny's well-known radio persona as a miser.\n\"The Million Pound Bank Note\", an 1893 short story with a similar premise, written by Mark Twain.\nAdjusting for inflation, this is roughly the equivalent of spending $29,910,000 in one year.\n\"IBDB.com: Brewster's Millions\".\nThe Theatre Magazine; January, 1907; pg. 31 accessed August 22, 2012\n\"Tonight (Lux Radio advertisement)\".

                "description": "The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal Worldand Us   is a 2017 book by the ornithologist and evolutionary biologist Richard O. Prum about the power of aesthetic mate choice, arguing it to be an important independent agent in evolution. Prum indicates that while Charles Darwin made this argument in The Descent of Man, published in 1871, the concept was sidelined and forgotten and the notion of natural selection being the sole driver of evolution took over. As an ornithologist, Prum describes many examples in avian evolution where aesthetics are preeminent. Prum proceeds to apply the principle of aesthetic evolution as an independent force in human evolution.",

Prum indicates that Darwin recognizing difficulties in the theory of natural selection advanced the view that sexual selection is an additional force in evolution and presented this argument in The Descent of Man. Alfred Russel Wallace, St. George Mivart and other early evolutionists helped to elevate natural selection as the only force in evolution and delegated sexual selection to a subsidiary role. It was argued that sexual selection was based on recognition of markers of survival fitness, so that, for instance in birds, male ornamentation advertises superior health. \nPrum describes numerous examples in avian evolution where evolved traits seem to contradict selection of individual fitness. Examples are the decorative feathers of the male great argus, the dances of the male red-capped manakin, and the flight patterns of the male golden-winged manakin. The wing structure of the male club-winged manakin demonstrates \"decadence\" as the wing is modulated for singing and less well adapted for flight. In all these examples female mate choice is at work. Prum follows Darwin in seeing sexual mate choice as being grounded in aesthetics; it is not linked to functionality. \nIn Prum's \"Beauty Happens\" hypothesis, mates may have arbitrary preferences for certain traits and their offspring inherit not only the traits but also the preference for them leading to a runaway co-evolution, a concept envisioned by Ronald Fisher a century ago. This self-organizing process will lead to a standard of beauty by itself without any adaptive benefit. \nMate choice can lead to sexual conflict when female sexual autonomy and male sexual control collide. Prum's chapter on duck sex shows how female ducks evolved having convoluted vaginas to protect themselves against effects of forced copulation. A description of bowerbird courtship demonstrates complex \"artistic\" constructions by males to lure female mates whereby these constructions seem to provide some sort of aesthetic value and safety for the female. \nIn the last third of the book, Prum looks at human evolution, specifically how female preferences may have shaped us as a species over time. Female and male desire and behavior co-evolved leading to pronounced secondary sexual characteristics, prolonged sex, sexual variety, and an uncoupling of sex and fertility. Prum's view of sexual selection helps to understand the development of homosexuality, monogamy, female orgasm, and capacity of sex outside of the fertile period.\nDavid Dobbs indicates that Prum's view is controversial but that he makes his case with clarity, grace, and charm, namely that aesthetic courtship gives females sexual choice, autonomy and safety. While he does not agree with all points, Adrian Barnett seems to like the new look at Darwin's work: \"The problem is, it seems, that we all think we know Darwin. In fact, few of us go back to the original, instead taking for granted what other people say he said. In this case, it seems to have created a bit of validation by wish fulfilment: Darwin's views on sexual selection, Prum says, have been 'laundered, re-tailored and cleaned-up for ideological purity'.\" Ed Yong writes that Prum's book is an explicitly feminist book that is focused on female choice and observes that freedom of sexual choice arises from evolution and shapes evolution.\nReception among evolutionary biologists has been less positive.  Although Douglas Futuyma recommended the book as \"marvelously interesting and well-written, sometimes erudite and sometimes humorous\", he suggests that Prum mischaracterizes the views of evolutionary biologists and says that findings from theoretical population genetics undermine the fundamental premise of the book. Jerry Coyne criticized an essay by Prum in The New York Times that was adapted from The Evolution of Beauty, stating that it is \"both erroneous and confusing, for it misrepresents sexual selection, natural selection, and modern evolutionary theory.\" He later described the book as a \"mixed bag\" but stated that the bad parts outweighed the good, and stated that Prum's arguments were \"tendentious\". Evolutionary biologists Gerald Borgia and Gregory Ball state that Prum misrepresents opposition of scientists to the model of runaway selection and that he fails to make a case for its ubiquity. Further, they claim Prum inappropriately injects politics into biology, conflating eugenics and genocide with female mate choice to encourage readers to accept his arguments on political rather than scientific grounds.

The book has provoked controversy with some online commentary claiming it is another 'flea', a term used by Dawkins to describe people who have published books about him or his ideas. An article by Fern Elsdon-Baker in New Scientist of 19 July 2009 entitled the \"Dawkins Dogma\" contains parts of the arguments put forward within the book. The Selfish Genius has been criticized in The Economist for failing to fully understand Dawkins' selfish gene metaphor, with the reviewer claiming Dawkins accommodates proposed alternative evolutionary mechanism Elsdon-Baker suggests within her own ideas.  However a generally positive reception has been seen amongst proponents of group selection and Philip Ball wrote a largely positive review in The Times that acknowledges she is right to \"call time on a Whiggish view of the history of evolution\". Popular Science author Brian Clegg reviewed the book and described it as brilliantly identifying how Dawkins' views sit within the latest theories on evolution.\n\"New Scientist Article by Fern Elsdon-Baker\n\"Economist Review\"\nTimes Review\n\"Popular Science Review\"\n\"Author's Webpage\""

Callenbach wove his story using the fiber of technologies, lifestyles, folkways, and attitudes that were common in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest.  The \"leading edges\" (his main ideas for Ecotopian values and practices) were patterns in actual social experimentation taking place in the American West. To draw an example, Callenbach's fictional Crick School was based on Pinel School, an alternative school located outside Martinez, California, and attended for a time by his son.\nCallenbach placed the genesis of Ecotopia with an article he researched and wrote titled \"The Scandal of Our Sewage\".\nBesides the important social dimensions of the story, he talked publicly about being influenced, during work on the novel, by many streams of thought:  scientific discoveries in ecology and conservation biology;  the urban-ecology movement, concerned with a new approach to urban planning;  and the soft-energy movement, championed by Amory Lovins and others.  Much of the environmentally benign energy, home building and transportation technology described by the author was based on his reading of research findings published in such journals as Scientific American and Science.\nCallenbach\u2019s concept does not reject high technology (or any technology) as long as it does not interfere with the Ecotopian social order and serves the overall objectives.  Members of his fictional society prefer to demonstrate a conscious selectivity toward technology, so that not only human health and sanity might be preserved, but also social and ecological wellbeing. For example, Callenbach\u2019s story anticipated the development and liberal usage of videoconferencing.\nDuring the 1970s when Ecotopia was written and published, many prominent counterculture and New Left thinkers decried the consumption and overabundance that they perceived as characteristic of post-World War II America.  The citizens of Ecotopia share a common aim: a balance between themselves and nature. They were \"literally sick of bad air, chemicalized food, and lunatic advertising. They turned to politics because it was finally the only route to self-preservation.\" In the mid-20th century as \u201cfirms grew in size and complexity citizens needed to know the market would still serve the interests of those for whom it claimed to exist.\u201d  Callenbach\u2019s Ecotopia targets the fact that many people did not feel that the market or the government were serving them in the way they wanted them to.  This book could be interpreted as \u201ca protest against consumerism and materialism, among other aspects of American life.\"\nThe term \"ecotopian fiction\", as a subgenre of science fiction and utopian fiction, makes implicit reference to this book.\nThe book is set in 1999 (25 years in the future from 1974) and consists of diary entries and reports of journalist William Weston, who is the first American mainstream media reporter to investigate Ecotopia, a small country that broke away from the United States in 1980. Prior to Weston's reporting, most Americans had been barred from entering the new country, which is depicted as being on continual guard against revanchism.  The new nation of Ecotopia consists of Northern California, Oregon, and Washington; it is hinted that Southern California is a lost cause.  The novel takes its form as a narrative from Weston's diary in combination with dispatches that he transmits to his publication, the fictional Times-Post.\nAt the beginning, Weston is skeptically curious about, not yet sympathetic to the Ecotopians.  He describes details of the Ecotopian transportation system and the preferred lifestyle.  This includes a wide range of gender roles, sexual freedom, and acceptance of non-monogamous relationships.  Liberal cannabis use is evident.  Televised passive, mass-media, spectator sports have been displaced in favor of local arts coverage, local participatory sports, and general fitness.  A large fraction of young male Ecotopians participate voluntarily in a decidedly male ritual of mock warfare using wooden spears but no guns or arrows.  The games are not re-enactments.

A year has passed since the events in David Starr, Space Ranger.  In that time the spaceship TSS Waltham Zachary has been taken and gutted by pirates based in the asteroid belt. Because David \"Lucky\" Starr harbors a personal dislike of the pirates for their murder of his parents, he has devised a plan whereby the unmanned survey ship Atlas, as soon as the pirates capture it and bring it to their hidden base, will explode. Unknown to anyone, Starr has leaked the plan to the pirates and sneaked aboard the ship, believing an infiltration will be a more efficient way to bring down the pirates.\nWhen captured, Starr tells the pirate leader, Captain Anton, that his name is Williams (his alias from David Starr, Space Ranger), and offers to join the pirates; whereupon Anton has Starr fight a duel in open space to prove himself worthy.  Starr wins the duel, but remains a prisoner aboard Atlas while it is brought to an anonymous asteroid.\nThe asteroid is home to a hermit named Joseph Patrick Hansen, and the pirates leave Starr in Hansen's care. Hansen tells Starr that he purchased the asteroid as a vacation site, and gradually made it more comfortable over the years, but now depends on the pirates for supplies, and later recognizes the pretended \"Williams\" as Lawrence Starr's son. Starr admits his true identity, and Hansen convinces him to pilot them to Ceres.\nOn Ceres, Starr plans to send his friend Bigman to infiltrate the pirates, but realizes that Hansen's asteroid is not where it should be.  Starr and Bigman take their own spaceship Shooting Starr to search for it and eventually land on its surface, where Starr is captured by Dingo, the pirate he beat in the duel.  Dingo takes him inside the asteroid, revealing a hyperatomic engine used to move it.  A fight with Dingo ends when Starr is struck with a neuronic whip and loses consciousness.\nStarr wakes to find himself in a spacesuit on the surface of the asteroid; whereupon Dingo straps him to a catapult and flings him into space.  He uses his oxygen reserve to reverse his course and return to the asteroid, where he and Bigman defeat some of the pirates. As they leave the pirates' asteroid, they learn that a pirate fleet is attacking Ceres.\nReturning to Ceres, Starr realizes that the pirates' real object was to capture Hansen, which they have accomplished, and learns that Captain Anton's ship is taking Hansen to a secret Sirian base on Ganymede, whence the Sirians plan to attack Earth while Earth's fleet is occupied fighting the pirates in the Asteroid Belt. Although Anton has a 12-hour head start, Starr passes him to Ganymede by skimming the Shooting Starr past the Sun, wearing the Martian \"Space Ranger\" mask to ward off the heat and radiation.\nWhen Anton makes for Ganymede, Starr threatens to ram his ship, and accelerates toward it, all the while talking to Anton.  The ships are ten miles apart when Hansen kills Anton and orders Anton's crew to surrender to Starr.\nWhen the Terran fleet arrives to take custody of the pirate ship, Starr convinces the commanding admiral to concentrate on the asteroid pirates and leave the Sirian base on Ganymede alone, revealing that Hansen is the leader of the asteroid pirates. It is then revealed that while Starr was intercepting Anton's ship, the Council of Science, on Starr's orders, captured the base and achieved the wherewithal to terminate the asteroid piracy. Hansen is coerced to have the Sirians leave Ganymede, and is sent to incarceration on Mercury. Afterwards, Starr reveals that the matter between him and Hansen was not just about the latter being the pirate mastermind, but a far more personal one. Hansen claimed to have met David's father, but didn't recognize his two close friends (despite the three being all but inseparable), and claimed that David resembles his father the most when he is angry, despite Lawrence hardly ever being in that state. From that, David states that within an hour after meeting Hansen, he knew he was facing not his father's acquaintance, but his parents' murderer.\nWriting in The New York Times, Sidney Lohman praised Pirates as \"grand science fiction for all ages.\" Reviewer Groff Conklin described the novel as \"almost entirely conceived in the straight gee-whiz adventure technique that is the classical pattern for teenage adventure stories\", and not as \"cruel and bloody\" as the first Lucky Starr book, so \"Excellent for the Junior set\".

These two cities were home to the world's first plutonium production sites, and in Plutopia Brown charts the environmental and social impacts of those sites on the residents of and the environment surrounding the two cities. ...",

The book's protagonist, Humphrey Van Weyden, is a literary critic who is a survivor of an ocean collision and who comes under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues him. Its first printing of forty thousand copies was immediately sold out before publication on the strength of London's previous The Call of the Wild. Ambrose Bierce wrote, \"The great thingand it is among the greatest of thingsis that tremendous creation, Wolf Larsen... the hewing out and setting up of such a figure is enough for a man to do in one lifetime... The love element, with its absurd suppressions, and impossible proprieties, is awful.\"",

                "unshown_background": ": Infobox book. author: Jack London. caption: First edition cover. country: United States. genre: Adventure novel, psychological novel. image: Sea-wolf cover.jpg. language: English. media_type: Print (Hardback & Paperback). name: The Sea-Wolf. published: 1904, Macmillan. The personal character of the novel's antagonist \"Wolf\" Larsen was attributed to a real sailor London had known, Captain Alex MacLean. According to London himself, \"much of the Sea-Wolf is imaginary development, but the basis is Alexander McLean\". Captain Alex MacLean, or McLean, was born May 15, 1858 in East Bay, Nova Scotia. He did sail mostly in the Pacific North West with his brother, Captain Dan MacLean. MacLean was at one time the Sheriff of Nome, Alaska. The MacLean Captains maintained their ties to Cape Breton Island despite having spent much of their lives sailing the Pacific Coast and do have living descendants.\nLondon, who was called \"Wolf\" by his close friends, also used a picture of a wolf on his bookplate, and named his mansion Wolf House. Given that Van Weyden's experiences in the novel bear some resemblance to experiences London had, or heard told about, when he sailed on the Sophia Sutherland, the autodidact sailor Van Weyden has been compared to the autodidact sailor Jack London.\nLondon's intention in writing The Sea-Wolf was \"an attack on (Nietzsche's) super-man philosophy.\" Nietzsche and Schopenhauer are mentioned in the second sentence of the novel as the preferred reading of the friend Humphrey Van Weyden visited before his shipwreck. The novel also contains references to Herbert Spencer in chapters 8, 10, Charles Darwin in chapters 5, 6, 10, 13, Omar Khayyam in chapters 11, 17, 26, Shakespeare in chapter 5, and John Milton in chapter 26.\nThe plot has some initial similarities to Captains Courageous by Rudyard Kipling in that they each have an idle, rich young man rescued from the sea and shanghaied into becoming a working sailor; however, the two stories differ widely in plot and moral tone.\nThe Sea-Wolf tells the story of a soft, domesticated protagonist \u2014 an intellectual man named Humphrey Van Weyden \u2014 forced to become tough and self-reliant by exposure to cruelty and brutality. The story starts with him aboard a San Francisco ferry, called Martinez, which collides with another ship in the fog and sinks. He is set adrift in the Bay, eventually being picked up by Wolf Larsen. Larsen is the captain of a seal-hunting schooner, the Ghost. Brutal and cynical, yet also highly intelligent and intellectual (though highly biased in his opinions, as he was self-taught), he rules over his ship and terrorizes the crew with the aid of his exceptionally great physical strength. Van Weyden adequately describes him as an individualist, hedonist, and materialist. Larsen does not believe in the immortality of the soul, he finds no meaning in his life save for survival and pleasure and has come to despise all human life and deny its value. Being interested in someone capable of intellectual disputes, he somewhat takes care of Van Weyden, whom he calls \"Hump\", while forcing him to become a cabin boy, do menial work, and learn to fight to protect himself from a brutal crew.\nA key event in the story is an attempted mutiny against Wolf Larsen by several members of the crew. The organizers of the mutiny are Leach and Johnson. Johnson had previously been beaten severely by Larsen, and Leach had been punched earlier while being forced to become a boat-puller, motivating the two. The first attempt is by sending Larsen overboard; however, he manages to climb back onto the ship. Searching for his assailant, he ventures into the sleeping quarters, located beneath the main deck, the only exit being a ladder. Several, at least seven men, take part in the mutiny and attack Larsen. Larsen however, demonstrating his inhuman endurance, strength, and conviction, manages to fight his way through the crew, climb the ladder with several men hanging off him, and escape relatively unharmed. Van Weyden is promoted as mate, for the original mate had been murdered. Larsen later gets his vengeance by torturing his crew, and constantly claiming that he is going to murder Leach and Johnson at his earliest convenience, being the hunting season is done, as he can't afford to lose any crew. He later allows them to be lost to the sea when they attempt to flee on a hunting boat.\nDuring this section, the Ghost picks up another set of castaways, including a poet named Maud Brewster. Miss Brewster and van Weyden had known each other previously\u2014but only as writers. Both Wolf Larsen and van Weyden immediately feel attraction to her, due to her intelligence and \"female delicacy\". Van Weyden sees her as his first true love. He strives to protect her from the crew, the horrors of the sea, and Wolf Larsen. As this happens, Wolf Larsen meets his brother Death Larsen, a bitter opponent of his. Wolf kidnapped several of Death's crew and forced them into servitude to fill his own"

The plot is similar to the notorious real-life events on the sailing ship Bluebelle when, in 1961, the captain killed his wife and four passengers and set a surviving child adrift to die, all in an unsuccessful attempt to cash in his wife's life insurance policy. The book's subtitle is A story about money and dying, and it is written on several different levels. Throughout the plot are subtle discourses on what it means to have a \"good\" life, how people deal with stress and uncertainty, and at what point will someone reach out for healthy human contact, or else take self-interest as their highest goal. ...",

Sharpe's Enemy: Richard Sharpe and the Defence of Portugal, Christmas 1812 is the fifteenth historical novel in the Richard Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell, first published in 1984. The story is set in 1812 during the Napoleonic Wars.\nRichard Sharpe: Brevet major in the British Army\nPot-au-Feu:  Sergeant Deron, who appears in Sharpe's Havoc, and is the leader of the renegade band\nJosefina LaCosta was the female lead in Sharpe's Eagle and Sharpe's love interest. She was last seen in Sharpe's Gold where she had set up house in Lisbon entertaining wealthy allied officers. Colonel Sir Augustus Farthingdale has her masquerade as his wife in exchange for his maintaining her in a life of luxury.\nCornwell describes Adrados as the Gateway of God where outnumbered Spanish knights defeated Moors during the Wars of Spain. The convent in Adrados was set up to commemorate the piety of this event.\nMadame Dubreton uses a line from the poem \"Eloise and Abelard\" by Alexander Pope. She said \"withering in my bloom, lost in [a convent's] solitary gloom.\"\nThe novel was adapted for the second season of the Sharpe television series. It guest starred Jeremy Child as Sir Augustus, Helena Mitchell as Sarah Dubreton and Tony Haygarth as Pot-au-Feu. The adaptation kept the basic plot of the novel but many details were changed, notably the character of Josefina was not reused and was replaced with a new character, Isabella (played by Elizabeth Hurley), the wife of Sir Augustus and an old flame of Sharpe, with whom he has a sexual encounter while rescuing her. (In the novels, Isabella is the name of Harper's wife; the television adaptation instead gives him a girlfriend named Ramona.) Teresa is introduced earlier near the beginning of the adaptation, as is Ducos who accompanies Dubreton to his first meeting with Hakeswill. Sharpe is not promoted to major until midway through the adaptation prior to his return to the convent, Teresa is killed earlier when Hakeswill escapes after the convent's capture and the final battle with the French is significantly downgraded, being reduced to a single repulsed charge. The task of finishing Hakeswill's execution is given to an anonymous officer which Sharpe merely watching from the distance.\n\nSection from Bernard Cornwell's website on Sharpe's Enemy\nIndependent Review of Sharpe's Enemy"

A BOAC airplane crash-lands on the Greenland ice cap far from its usual route after flying in a seemingly erratic fashion. An International Geophysical Year scientific research team based near the crash site rescues the surviving passengers and takes them to their cabin. Most of the flight crew are dead with one of the pilots having been shot in the back. The station's only means of contact with the outside world, a radio set, is destroyed in a seemingly accidental manner.\nWith not enough food for everyone and no hope of rescue, the leader of the scientific research team, Dr Mason, decides that they must set out for the nearest settlement, some 300 kilometers away at the coast. Meanwhile, the pilot who was shot and in a coma is found to have been suffocated with a pillow in his sleep. An attempt is also made on Mason's life by getting him to be lost in the arctic night. The scientists' suspicion falls on the stewardess but she is soon cleared. Mason orders another scientist, Joss, to stay behind and try to repair the radio so that a field expedition can be contacted. The dead passenger is determined to be a military courier; soon after that the wreck goes up in flames.\nMason leaves with the group along with the other scientist, Jackstraw, while remaining in touch with their station by means of a short range radio. Meanwhile, the field expedition returns to the station and contacts Mason. They inform him that a massive military mobilization has located the crashed plane and that it carried something very important. The government, having refused to divulge anything, had tried to contact Mason's station. Finding the station to be non-responding, they have requested the expedition chief, Captain Hillcrest, to investigate.\nMason decides to go on with the journey since any attempt to return will induce the murderers to act. He keeps this new  development to himself and Jackstraw. Hillcrest sets out after the group but soon finds that the petrol he picked up at the station has been tampered with. Sugar has been added to the petrol disabling the engine and leading him to get bogged down. A solution is found when one of the passengers, a chemist, suggests that the petrol be mixed with water and the top layer of the resultant mixture be siphoned off. At almost the same time, the government relents and informs Mason through Hillcrest that the military courier carried a top secret missile guidance mechanism disguised as a tape recorder. Mason realizes that one of the passengers picked up such a device at the crash site. This precipitates the murderers into action and they take over the group.\nFinding that killing the entire group is not possible, the criminals initially take the survivors with them, but soon abandon all of them except for the stewardess, for whom Mason has developed a romantic attachment, and the father and manager of a passenger who is a boxer. In the process, one of the passengers left behind is killed. The group stumbles on in the arctic blizzard guided by sled dogs. Soon they come across an abandoned sled that contains rocket radiosondes, which they use to guide Hillcrest to them. A chase ensues across the arctic landscape to the shore where a trawler waits for the criminals. But the intervention of the Navy, on information from Hillcrest, frightens off the trawler. The criminals are surrounded and after a bitter hand-to-hand struggle, the secret device and surviving hostages are rescued.\nThe first killer is killed, however the second one is still on the go. Having to have locked himself and the stewardess in a very fast moving glacier, it is not as easy for him anymore. Dr. Mason manages to rescue the stewardess, but the killer is left to die.\nThe New York Times called it a \"bang up adventure yarn filled with realistic, well researched data.\" The Chicago Tribune called the book \"powerful\". Michael Frayn in The Guardian called it \"clumsily written, absurdly implausible, thoroughly chilling.\"\nIn August 1959 film rights were bought by George Seaton and William Perlberg who had a deal with Paramount. They wanted to make the film with Debbie Reynolds with whom they had a long-term contract. They hired Eric Ambler to write a script. Lilli Palmer was announced as co star.\nIn 1961 Seaton said they wanted to film it after The Hook. William Holden was attached as star.  In December 1961 it was announced Richard Wilson would direct at Paramount. In 1963 Wilson said he still had a commitment to make the film, and had written the script with his wife Elizabeth Vance. However the film was never made.\n\"Mayhem on the Greenland Ice Cap:"

                "description": "When Eight Bells Toll is a first-person narrative novel written by Scottish author Alistair MacLean and published in 1966. It marked MacLean's return after a three-year gap, following the publication of Ice Station Zebra (1963), during which time he had run several restaurants. When Eight Bells Toll combines the genres of spy novel and detective novel. MacLean calls on his own Scottish background to authentically portray the rugged weather, people and terrain of western Scotland.",

Five cargo ships have been hijacked in the Irish Sea; ships carrying vast quantities of precious stones and gold bullion. The crews later turn up, but the ships have disappeared. Clearly, the hijackers are getting impeccable intelligence. The British Secret Service, under Rear-Admiral Sir Arthur Arnford-Jason (known as \"Uncle Arthur\") has planted agents on the ships \u2013 but only the ship's masters know of their presence. When no word is received from the agents, Phillip Calvert (who narrates the story) and Hunslett are sent to investigate.\nThey manage to track the latest hijacked ship \u2013 the Nantesville, carrying \u00a38 million in gold bullion \u2013 to the Scottish Highlands and the sleepy port town of Torbay on the Island of Torbay (patterned after Tobermory, on the Isle of Mull). Under cover of being marine biologists on a UNESCO project, they travel in the Firecrest, an outwardly normal but very specially equipped motor launch.  Calvert boards the ship under cover of night and finds that the two agents planted aboard have been murdered. His chief suspect is Cypriot shipping magnate Sir Anthony Skouros, whose luxury yacht, Shangri-La, is also anchored in Torbay.\nCalvert barely escapes the murderous hijackers, and returns to his boat. But late at night, they are boarded by local police and plain-clothes men claiming to be customs officers seeking information on stolen chemicals. After the search and their departure, he finds the boat's well-concealed powerful radio to have been sabotaged.\nWhile searching the surrounding area in a Fleet Air Arm Helicopter, Calvert meets the occupants of a castle, Lord Kirkside and his teenage daughter Susan, who both clearly want him away well from the castle, and a fierce gun-toting local on his private island.\nAs the helicopter brings Calvert back to Torbay, it comes under attack from the shore by machine-gun; and the pilot, Lieutenant Williams, is killed. The helicopter crashes, explodes and plummets into the sea. Calvert escapes from the helicopter after it sinks to the bottom. When he returns to Firecrest, he finds Hunslett is missing.\nNot having received any further communications from his agents, Uncle Arthur arrives himself by commandeered RAF launch. Together, they combat boarders and make ready for sea. On trying to use a concealed radio, they find it has been stolen and Hunslett's body left in its place.\nThey are joined by Skouras's second wife, Charlotte, who claims to have escaped from his physical and psychological abuse of her. When a pirate speedboat approaches, Calvert rams it, shoots the occupants and blows up the boat in vengeance for Hunslett's death.\nOn the promise of a share of the insurance reward, Calvert recruits the assistance of Tim Hutchinson, a shark fisherman who has unrivalled knowledge of local water conditions and boat handling. Guessing that the missing bullion ships are being sunk to allow the gold to be offloaded invisibly, Calvert, formerly a marine salvage expert, dives into the bay and finds the Nantesville. He fights and kills Quinn, one of the divers, whom he has previously encountered and who he suspects killed Hunslett.\nHe then penetrates Kirkside's castle, disabling the guards, and questions Susan. He discovers a powerful radio transmitter and caches of gold bullion. He concludes that the castle's occupants are working under duress with the hijackers, as is the local police sergeant, whose son is being held hostage.\nAt midnight (eight bells) the shark fishermen ram the gates of the underground dock with their boat. The pirates are expecting them because, in a final twist, Charlotte has been transmitting Calvert's plans to them. Calvert, held at gunpoint and expecting to be killed, asks that the real story be explained to him, which Charlotte does. It emerges that Skouras is also an innocent victim of the pirates; one of several who are working under duress. His real wife is not dead, as is widely believed, but in a French nursing home \u2013 Charlotte Meiner is her cousin and also under threat.\nThe standoff is broken by the sudden but pre-planned arrival of a detachment of Royal Marine Commandos. The pirates are disarmed and the several hostages are freed.\nCalvert tells Charlotte that he didn't believe her story, and that he knew from the beginning that she was faking, with information received from Uncle Arthur.\nCalvert is a typical MacLean hero, world-weary and sometimes cynical, yet ultimately honorable, who must battle bureaucracy as well as the bad guys to solve the crime. Calvert's frantic search for the hijackers and for the hostages they hold takes him over the remote"

Multi-millionaire Simeon Lee, frail in his old age, unexpectedly invites his family to gather at his home for Christmas. The gesture is met with suspicion by the guests. Simeon is not given to warm family sentiment, and the family are not on good terms, in particular, with the black sheep of the family, Harry. Simeon also searched out his orphaned, Spanish-born granddaughter, Pilar Estravados, to live in his house. None have met their late sister Jennifer's daughter before; she proves to be delightful. Simeon is intent on playing a cruel game with his family's emotions. Stephen Farr, a surprise guest, arrives on Christmas Eve. He is the son of Simeon's former partner in the diamond mines, welcomed warmly by Simeon. Simeon calls his family together that afternoon, to hear him on the telephone with his attorney, saying he wants to update his will after Christmas. This incomplete information stirs up negative feelings among his sons and their wives.\nAfter dinner on Christmas Eve, the sounds of crashing of furniture and a hideous scream are heard by several, who rush to Simeon's room. When they get to his door, they find it locked and have to break it down. The sight revealed includes heavy furniture overturned, crockery smashed, and Simeon dead, his throat slit, in a great pool of blood, a grisly and shocking sight. The local police superintendent is already at the front door, before anyone could call the police. Superintendent Sugden notices Pilar pick up something from the floor. He insists that she give the small bit of rubber and a small object made of wood to him.\nSugden explains that he is at the house by prior arrangement with the victim, who confided to him the theft of a substantial quantity of uncut diamonds from his safe. Poirot accompanies Colonel Johnson to investigate this murder. The murder generates many questions. How was the victim killed inside a locked room? Was the murder connected to the theft of the diamonds? And what is the significance of the small triangle of rubber and the peg first noticed by Pilar?\nPoirot's investigation explores the victim's methodical and vengeful nature and the way these characteristics come out in his sons, and observes physical traits as well. Each son, and perhaps one of the wives, appears as a suspect to the investigators. When the butler mentions his confusion about the identities of the house guests, Poirot realises that the four sons of Simeon's marriage may not be Simeon's only sons present in the home. Poirot finds the uncut diamonds mixed in with the stones of a decorative outdoor garden, which takes theft away as a motive. The family lawyer reads Simeon's will, which leaves half to son Alfred, who runs the business, and the other half to be split among his other children. This leaves Pilar with nothing, as her mother died a year earlier, and his granddaughter is not specifically named. Alfred, David and Harry agree to pool their inheritances and make a share for Pilar. This warm gesture, based on what is just, as Lydia tells her, upsets Pilar, and she refuses it. The final major clue comes from Pilar. She and Stephen are playing with balloons and one bursts; she mentions that the pieces are like what she found on the floor after Simeon Lee was killed. Poirot warns her to be \"on her guard\", as she knows more than she realises. Soon she is almost killed in another murder attempt, of a stone cannonball perched above her bedroom door.\nA cable comes from South Africa reporting that the son of Simeon\u2019s partner was dead; Stephen Farr admits his name is Stephen Grant, and he is in England to meet his father, from Simeon's last trip to South Africa, five years after his marriage in England. After that, Pilar reveals the story of the death of the real Pilar as the two crossed Spain during its civil war, and her own plan to arrive in England in her stead. With this knowledge, Sugden tries to blame the murder on Pilar. Then Poirot takes over and explains the crime. Poirot reveals that Sugden was another illegitimate child of Simeon, from an affair with a local girl. Sugden hated the man who abandoned his mother, paying her off. Sugden planned his revenge carefully and murdered his father hours before he set off the noisy sound effects.\nDavid is relieved of his years of anger toward his father for mistreating his mother. Stephen takes Pilar, now Conchita Lopez, to South Africa, to marry her. Lydia will invite them to a proper English Christmas.\nHercule Poirot, the Belgian detective\nColonel Johnson, Chief"

The Eyes of the Dragon takes place entirely within the realm of Delain (which itself is located within In-World from The Dark Tower series, as established in \"The Little Sisters of Eluria\"). It is told from the perspective of an unnamed storyteller/narrator, who speaks casually and frankly to the reader, frequently adding his own commentary on characters' motivations and the like.\nKing Roland's magician, Flagg, seeking to destroy the Kingdom of Delain, sees his plans being ruined by the good heart of Queen Sasha. After Sasha gives birth to Peter, a noble and worthy future king, Flagg realizes that his position, his plans, and his life may be in danger because of Peter. When Sasha is pregnant with a second son, Flagg seizes the opportunity. He forces the Queen's midwife to cut Sasha as the second son, Thomas, is born. Sasha bleeds to death and Flagg begins plotting to remove Peter.\nAs Peter becomes a teenager, he begins the custom of bringing a glass of wine to his father before bed each night. Flagg decides to use this as a means of framing Peter. He dissolves a poison called \"Dragon Sand\" in a glass of wine and delivers it to the king after Peter leaves. Previously, in an attempt to win Thomas' friendship, Flagg had shown him a secret passage where Thomas could spy on his father. Unbeknownst to Flagg, when he delivers the poison, Thomas is watching through the glass eyes of the mounted head of Roland's greatest trophy, Niner the dragon. Flagg plants evidence incriminating Peter.\n\nAfter a brief trial, during which the judge decides Peter is guilty, he is locked up in the enormous tower called the Needle in the center of the city. Thomas is then crowned King, although he is only twelve years old; due to his youth and his fearful inexperience, he allows Flagg enormous amounts of power. At the start of his long stay in the Needle, Peter manages to send a note to the judge who convicted him, Anders Peyna, with the seemingly innocuous requests to have his mother's old dollhouse and napkins with his meals. Peyna is puzzled by the requests, but, seeing no harm in them, grants them. Five years later, Peter escapes from the Needle, having used the toy loom in the dollhouse and threads from the napkins to make a rope. After the escape he and his allies rush to get Roland's bow and arrow. However, it is not to be found because Thomas had it once they got into the king's \"sitting room\". Flagg, now revealed as a demonic being, is about to kill them when Thomas reveals himself and tells Flagg that he (Thomas) watched Flagg poison Roland. Thomas shoots Flagg in the eye, but Flagg uses magic to disappear and escape. At the end of the novel, Peter is declared to be the rightful king. Thomas, who has become deeply hated in Delain, sets off alongside his butler, Dennis, to find Flagg. They find him and confront him, but the narrator does not reveal the outcome.\n\nKing Alan II (aka Alan the Mad) \u2013 uncle of Queen Kyla the Good; grandfather of King Landry. Alan's legendarily-beautiful cousin Eleanor married Duke Leven Valera of the South Barony (aka the Black Duke).\nQueen Kyla the Good \u2013 niece of King Alan the Mad; mother of King Landry; grandmother of Queen Lita.\nKing Landry \u2013 grandson of King Alan the Mad; son of Queen Kyla the Good; father of Queen Lita; grandfather of King Roland the Good\nQueen Lita \u2013 granddaughter of Queen Kyla the Good; daughter of King Landry; mother of King Roland the Good; grandmother of Princes Thomas and Peter.

In his younger and more virile days, Roland was renowned for slaying Niner the Dragon with Foe-Hammer, a great hunting-arrow forged by his mother, Queen Lita. Over the years since then, Roland has become somewhat infirm and addled. He trusts Flagg, his counselor, little realizing the ill will that Flagg harbors toward him. However, early in the story, he does favor his wife's advice more than Flagg's. Roland is the husband of Queen Sasha; their sons are Peter and Thomas.\nQueen Sasha \u2013 Roland's wife; mother of Peter and Thomas. Sasha was chosen for Roland because she was an innocent girl from a lesser noble family...and, seemingly, the shyest of those whom Flagg had selected for Roland. Flagg believed Sasha would pose the least long-term threat to his authority; Roland, for his part, chose her since she seemed the least frightening to him. Yet Sasha revealed herself to be a strong and independent woman, who truly loved - and was truly loved in return by - both Roland and the kingdom. She was murdered under Flagg's orders while giving birth to Thomas. Her cousin is Squire Andrew"

Karou has left Earth for the land of the chimaera and seraphim, Eretz, where the chimaera have been defeated by the seraphim. She has begun the job taken up by her adopted father Brimstone: the art of resurrection, which will bring the dead members of the broken chimaera army back to life to defeat the seraphim. She blames Akiva for everything, while the angel himself thinks her dead and begins training with his half-siblings Hazael and Liraz to keep his feelings from overwhelming him. Karou's best friend Zuzana and her boyfriend Mik begin looking for her after a mysterious e-mail and reports that a phantom girl has been stealing teeth.\nThe son of the Warlord and new commander of the chimaera army, Thiago, has been courting Karou during her resurrection process and has offered up his own pain for the tithing process multiple times. He has specific resurrection instructions for her: make everyone larger, stronger, faster, and winged. Through this repeated process, the chimaera finally begin to win against the seraphim. Thiago has also brought a wolf chimaera named Ten to help Karou with the resurrection process and to serve as a sort of babysitter when Karou goes on her tooth missions. While she dislikes it, she is afraid to offend Thiago.\nMeanwhile, two deer-like centaurs called Dama by the names of Sveva and Sarazal have escaped from slavery and are on the run. Sarazal has an infection from her manacles chafing her while she was enslaved. A boy named Rath of the Dashnag, chimaera with saber-toothed tiger heads, comes and helps them by carrying Sarazal to a Caprine village. The Caprine have a poultice to help Sarazal. When the seraphim, including Akiva, are looking for the Caprine, Sarazal wakes up to see Rath and screams. Akiva pretends that it was just a bird and leads the other seraphim away.\nZuzana and Mik decode the \"puzzle\" of Karou's e-mail and find where the chimaera are hiding. She is forced to tell them about her life as Madrigal and her job as a resurrectionist. This thrills Zuzana, who demands to help. Karou refuses to let her and says that they need to get out as soon as possible. While they are told to leave, they amuse the chimaera and enjoy it in their presence.\nThiago sends out an army including Ziri, Madrigal's \"little Kirin shadow\", to what he says is the Hintermost to help other chimaera, but in reality is an attack mission. The chimaera actually go to the Hintermost to help, and all die except for Ziri, who manages to glean the souls of the dead before attacking angels, who attack him in return. Karou says that she could try to heal him. After he is healed, Ziri tells Karou everything, including how Akiva summoned birds to let the Kirin escape.\nRazgut, the fallen angel who held onto Iz\u00eel's back, found his way to Eretz and tells the seraphim that Karou is with the chimaera and practicing the art of resurrection. Among the seraphim, Akiva, Hazael, and Liraz plan on how to kill the emperor Joram and his brother Jael in the hope of ending the war and leading to a more peaceful world. Akiva seeks out Karou and gives her a thurible with Issa's soul in it. While Thiago is not pleased with Issa's return, he allows her to stay when Karou points out that the Naja will be able to help with resurrection work.\nWhen Akiva is summoned to a council with Joram, he has his opportunity to kill the emperor. He uses the glamour to disguise his sword and, upon hearing the news that Joram killed his mother Festival, kills the emperor. Jael then steps in and kills Japheth, the crown prince, so that he can be the new emperor. Jael then commands that white robes and harps be given to everyone in an attempt to invade the human world and make the chimaera look evil for trying to fight the holy angels. Jael's army then attacks Akiva, Liraz, and Hazael, and they end up killing Hazael. Akiva says to take his body to Karou.\nTen comes in to talk to Karou and Karou aggravates the wolf, so she threatens the resurrectionist with killing off Zuzana and Mik. Karou teaches the two to become invisible, and they sneak away to a hotel in Morocco. Karou gets a memory of Brimstone sealing the souls of a thousand dead women and children in a cathedral after the fall of Loramendi, and they could be gleaned and given bodies again. While some stand with Karou, Thiago refuses. Later, Bast comes to Karou's door and says that three of those who stood with her, Amzallag and the Shadows That Live, were taken to the pit"

After killing Thiago while defending herself from him, Karou puts Ziri's soul in his body and Haxaya's in Ten's body, allowing her to lead the Chimaera.  When Zuzana and Mick come bearing news of Jael's arrival on Earth, the new Chimaera leadership is able to negotiate an alliance with the Misbegotten.  They have to learn to make peace and to not wipe each other out if they are to work together against the Dominion.\nEliza Jones is a 24-year-old researcher in Washington, D.C., where she is working on her Ph.D. As a girl, she escaped a cult that worshipped her as a prophet and descendant of the angel Elazael.  She has visions in her dreams of monsters coming from the sky.  When the recently abandoned camp of the Chimaera in Morocco is found and the pit is excavated, her boss is called in to analyse it, and she travels with him.  Seeing the corpses of the Chimaera triggers more visions.\nJael has arrived with his soldiers, the Dominion, in Vatican City.  Aided by Razgut, he portrays his forces as the angels from human mythology and asks humanity for help defeating devils; once he is armed with modern human technology, he intends to wipe out the Stelians.\nAkiva is discovered by Stelian emissaries who, following his accidental disruption of the fabric of the universe while casting a spell, intend to kill him.  They realise he is the child of Festival, and follow him invisibly. Ziri, as Thiago, rescues Liraz from Haxaya, whom Liraz had killed an earlier incarnation of. Akiva figures out how to make the seraph soldiers invulnerable to the effects of Chimaera hamsas. The allied army travels to the portal to stop the Dominion, but are ambushed on the way, and Ziri and Liraz are presumed dead.\nOn Earth, Karou, Akiva, Zuzana, Mik, and a Chimaera soldier discover Eliza, speaking prophecies in Seraphim, on their way to the Vatican.  They are assisted by Esther, until she sells them out to Jael in exchange for the mining rights to Eretz.  Esther throws Zuzana and Mik out of her hotel room, but they steal the stash of wishes given to her by Brimstone.\nKarou and Akiva attempt to infiltrate Jael's lodgings, but are expected. However, using the same spell Akiva used to synchronise the burning of Brimstone's portals, they are able to set an incendiary charge on Jael and force him to return to Eretz unarmed. Zuzana and Mik wish for Eliza to be returned to her best possible self, and she regains her memories as Elazael and transforms into a Seraphim.\nIn Eretz, the Misbegotten and Chimera alliance has managed to convert the rest of the armed forces to their cause, and upon returning Jael is imprisoned. Ziri has died, but Liraz has gleaned his soul, and he is resurrected. Eliza, Mik, and Zuzana return to Eretz through another portal known to Elazael.\nThe Stelians arrive to confront Akiva, whose magic has been damaging the fabric of the universe, endangering Eretz. Eliza tells the history of Eretz and reveals that the creation myth the Seraphim have involving \"Godstars\" is in fact a prophecy, and they are destined to battle the beasts that threaten Eretz together.\nPublishers Weekly gave Dreams of Gods and Monsters a starred review.

Un Lun Dun is a young adult fantasy novel by China Mi\u00e9ville, released in 2007. The title is derived from 'UnLondon,' the name of the alternate realm where the book is set. It also contains illustrations by Mi\u00e9ville. It was first released in January 2007. The novel also won the 2008 Locus Award for Best Young Adult Book.\nDeeba: Since Deeba takes Zanna's place as the saviour of UnLondon, she is called \"the Unchosen One.\" On Zanna's first day at Kilburn Comprehensive, Deeba is able to make her laugh, something most people can't do. She likes to do things her own way, and is not a stereotypical hero. Along the way, she is joined by her pet milk carton, Curdle, a half-ghost named Hemi, and a talking prophecy book that often gets information wrong.\nZanna: Zanna has the title \"the Shwazzy,\" which is related to the French adjective \"choisie,\" meaning \"chosen\". She hates her given name, \"Susanna,\" but she hates \"Sue\" even more. She is tall and striking, with blond hair, but she always tries to stay in the background. This doesn't work very well. When she is attacked by a Stink-Junkie, a servant of the Smog, in UnLondon, she breathes in Smog and falls ill. Zanna is sent back to London by Brokkenbroll, leader of unbrellas, with her memories of UnLondon erased forever.\nHemi: Hemi is a half-ghost, the result of a union between an UnLondoner and a dead Londoner. While normal ghosts cannot speak in a way that non-ghosts can hear them, Hemi can speak to both ghosts and non-ghosts. He has trouble fitting in because both ghosts and non-ghosts despise him for being a 'half-breed'. Most inhabitants of Wraithtown do not have to eat. Since Hemi does, he's taken to stealing or \"extreme shopping,\" as he calls it.\nBenjamin Unstible: Was killed by Smog but brought back to life and possessed by Smog. While possessed, he was credited with developing a formula for making the unbrellas Smog-proof. In reality Brokkenbroll controlled the unbrellas and they were part of Smog's plan to take over UnLondon\nThe Smog: The Smog is a living radioactive cloud that was created by a different mixture of chemicals in the air of London. It thinks of no one but itself and consuming new gases to add to its mixture. It is also hungry for knowledge and absorbs any information contained in books that are burned and their smoke added to the mixture. The Smog attacked London years ago but was beaten by the \"Klinneract\", which was really the 1956 Clean Air Act; it then seeped into UnLondon and is now trying to take over UnLondon. Working for it is Brokkenbroll, the leader of unbrellas, or broken umbrellas from London. It creates servants from its Smog, such as Smombies (corpses re-animated with Smog), Smoglodytes (disfigured creatures made from Smog), and Stink-Junkies (humans forced to be addicted to the Smog).\nThe Book: The Book is full of prophecies that often end up wrong, or so they think. It befriends Deeba but is first reluctant about Hemi. The one thing that he thinks is wrong about the prophesy of the Shwazzy is that it says, \"The smog is afraid of Nothing and the Ungun.\" They think it is meant to say \"The Smog is afraid of nothing BUT the Ungun.\"\nGiraffes: The giraffes are cannibals that use their necks to hang the skins of their victims.\nObaday Fing: Obaday Fing is a tailor whose head is an enormous pin-cushion. He uses paper to make clothing and runs a stall in a market near Wraithtown\nBrokkenbroll: Brokkenbroll is the boss of the broken umbrellas.\nConductor Jones\nThe Propheseers\nMurgatroyd: Is the secretary of Elizabeth Rawley, the environment minister.\nMr.Speaker\nRosa\nYorick Cavea\nThough Un Lun Dun is not directly related to the Bas-Lag universe or to any of Mi\u00e9ville's other works, it does contain various subtle references to his other books:\nOne protagonist mentions Varmin Way, which is a living street first mentioned in the short story \"Reports Of Certain Events In London\" (found in the collection Looking for Jake).\nThe Courageous Egg, a book spotted by Deeba whilst between worlds, is featured in The Scar as the book from which Shekel first learns to read.\nThe Wordhoard Pit, the extensive library which connects all libraries, shares its name with a ship in The Scar, called The Wordhoard located in Armada's Haunted Quarter.\nOne of the monsters created by the smog is very similar to an inchman, featured most prominently in Iron Council.\nThere are also some connections to other books, such as a library book entitled: A London Guide for the Blazing Worlders.\nCharlie Fletcher's 2006 novel Stoneheart is also about children who travel to an alternate city named \"unLondon\".\nMieville's acknowledgements section mentions that"

A grandson of Mark Antony and great-nephew of Augustus, he was a member of the Julio-Claudian family, Rome's first imperial ruling family. Claudius' family kept him out of public life until his sudden coronation at the age of fifty because of his persistent stammer, limp, and other nervous tics, which caused others to perceive him as mentally deficient and not a threat to his ambitious relatives. Even as his symptoms began to wane in his teenage years, he ran into trouble as a budding historian; his work on a history of the Roman civil wars was either too truthful or too critical of the reigning emperor Augustus, and his mother Antonia Minor and grandmother Livia quickly put a stop to it. This episode reinforced their initial suspicions that Claudius was not fit for public office. \nClaudius was portrayed this way by scholars for most of history, and Graves uses these peculiarities to develop a sympathetic character whose survival in a murderous dynasty depends upon his family's incorrect assumption that he is a harmless idiot. Graves' interpretation of the story owes much to the histories of Gaius Cornelius Tacitus, Plutarch, and (especially) Suetonius' Lives of the Twelve Caesars. Graves translated Suetonius before writing the novels and claimed that after reading Suetonius, Claudius came to him in a dream one night and demanded that his real story be told. The life of Claudius provided Graves with a way to write about the first four emperors of Rome from an intimate point of view. I, Claudius is written as a first-person narrative of Roman history from Claudius' perspective, covering the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula; Claudius the God is written as a later addition documenting Claudius' own reign. The real Claudius was a trained historian and is known to have written an autobiography (now lost) in eight books that covered the same period.\nGraves provides a theme for the story by having the fictional Claudius describe a visit to Cumae, where he receives a prophecy in verse from the Sibyl and an additional prophecy contained in a book of \"Sibylline Curiosities\". The latter concerns the fates of the \"hairy ones\" (i.e. the Caesars \u2013 from the Latin word \"caesar\", meaning \"a fine head of hair\") who are to rule Rome. The penultimate verse concerns his reign and Claudius assumes that he can tell the identity of the last emperor described in the prophecy. Graves establishes a fatalistic tone that plays out at the end of Claudius the God when Claudius correctly predicts his assassination and succession by Nero.\nAt Cumae, the Sibyl tells Claudius that he will \"speak clear\". Claudius believes this means that his secret memoirs will one day be found and that he, having written the truth, will speak clearly, while his contemporaries, who had to distort their histories to appease the ruling family, will seem like stammerers. Since he wishes to record his life for posterity, Claudius explains that he chooses to write in Greek, which he believes will remain \"the chief literary language of the world\". This enables Graves' Claudius to offer explanations of Latin wordplay or etymologies that would seem unnecessary if his autobiography had been written for native Latin speakers. Claudius also portrays his grandmother Livia as a scheming Machiavellian, based on the works of Tacitus and Cassius Dio, who wrote that rumours persisted that Augustus was poisoned by Livia, but these are mainly dismissed as malicious fabrications spread by political enemies of the dynasty.\nWriting in the first-person (from an unspecified time period, presumably late in his own reign as emperor), Claudius establishes himself as the author of this history of his family and insists on writing the truth, which includes harsh criticisms of the deified Augustus and especially of Livia. The narrative begins prior to his own birth, as he describes many of the events leading to the foundation of the Roman Principate and the increasingly firm emplacement of Augustus as emperor despite Augustus' own publicly expressed intention to eventually restore the former Republic. During his prosperous reign, Augustus is plagued by personal losses as his favored heirs, Marcellus, Marcus Agrippa, Gaius Caesar, and Lucius Caesar, die. Claudius reveals that these untimely deaths are all the machinations of Augustus' third wife Livia (who is also Claudius' paternal grandmother), a calculating murderess"

Phoenix is a fantasy novel by American writer Steven Brust, the fifth book in his Vlad Taltos series, set in the fantasy world of Dragaera. Originally published in 1990 by Ace Books, it was reprinted in 2002 along with Taltos in the omnibus The Book of Taltos. Following the trend of the Vlad Taltos books, it is named after one of the Great Houses and features that house as an important element to its plot.\nThe novel is broken into three titled books. The chapters are called \"Lessons\" and their titles describe what Vlad learns.\nBrust wrote this novel with the intention of taking a long break from writing about Vlad, but this did not happen.\nThe character Aibynn is based on Brust's drum teacher, Robin Anders. The members of Aibynn's band are also Tuckerisms of Anders's band, Boiled in Lead.\nVlad's line \"Across the great salt sea. Out past the horizon. To sail beyond the--\" stitches together lines from John Greenleaf Whittier's poem \"Kathleen\" and Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem \"Ulysses\".\nHouse Phoenix is the smallest noble house in the Empire because a Dragaeran is not considered a Phoenix unless an actual phoenix passes overhead at the time of birth. Members of Phoenix are the most noble of all Dragaerans and tend to have an air of majesty. Their house color is gold, and they usually have gold hair and eyes. Phoenix is the first house in the Cycle, and thus each Phoenix Emperor is responsible for beginning the cycle anew. Most become decadent at the end of their reigns, but every seventeenth cycle the decadent Phoenix is followed by a \"reborn\" Phoenix who never sinks to decadence.\nLike the mythological beast, Dragaeran phoenixes are flying creatures that die in flames and resurrect from the ashes, representing the house's role of rebirth, rejuvenation, and decay in the cycle. Phoenix appears twice in the Cycle Poem: at the beginning, \"Phoenix sinks into decay\", and at the end, \"Phoenix rise from ashes gray\".\nBooks by Steven Brust - The Dream Cafe Archived 2007-02-09 at the Wayback Machine\nNames"

The story is set sometime after the September 11 attacks in an unnamed Middle Eastern country, where Younis, a 15-year-old local boy survives an errant U.S. military operation. An international relief agency relocates him to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he's raised by a foster family with the new name of \"Jonas\" and where he struggles to assimilate. After savagely beating another student who had been bullying him, he is mandated to visit a councilor, who attempts to help him confront his traumatic past. He receives a scholarship and enrolls at the University of Pittsburgh, where he meets and falls in love with Shakri, a beautiful pre-med student from India. He also begins hanging around with a hard-partying group of exchange students and drinking to the point of blackout. Eventually, he is put in contact with Rose, the mother of a soldier, Christopher, who participated in the attack that killed his family, and who has been missing ever since. Jonas tries to help Rose come to terms with the loss of her son by describing for her the last hours of his life. But he's awash in conflicting emotions and changes parts of the story, \"adding and subtracting, substituting what should have been said for what he fails to remember accurately.\" As these memories surface, Jonas become more and more unstable, drinking to the point of blackout and acting abusively toward Shakri, in scenes that are reminiscence of returning soldiers' experiences with Posttraumatic stress disorder.  Eventually, Jonas honors the memory of Chris by mailing to Rose a journal that Chris kept while he was deployed. When the package arrives, she is out in her garden planting a new tree (\"thinking that she is being overly optimistic, planting a tree at her age\") which represents life after years of mourning.\nThe book is written in short, succinct sections from multiple points of view, alternating between Jonas in the present, Jonas in his memories from his home country, Rose and her memories or her son, and Chris, through reproduced entries and in his journal, which becomes, over the course of the story, the eponymous name of the book. In an interview with the French journal Mediapart, Dau stated that while this fragmented style does add to the sense of emotional fragmentation Jonas experiences in the book, the reason he wrote like this initially was that he \"was pretty good at writing beginnings, and pretty good at writing endings...but not very good at writing middles.\"\nDau chose to write about teenagers involved in war because he wanted \"needed a protagonist who was both old enough to understand what was going on and young enough to be largely blameless for it.\" He has also stated that he decided to leave the home country of refugee Jonas unnamed because \"leaving Jonas's home country vague lends the story a certain universality. By happening nowhere specific, it could have happened anywhere.\"\nCritical reception for The Book of Jonas has been overwhelmingly positive. It was a semifinalist for the 2012 First Novelist Award, and it was named one of the ten best books of 2012 by the Wall Street Journal, which called it \"the year's finest novel addressing America's 21st-century wars.\" It was named one of the best books of the year by Kirkus Reviews, which called it \"a literary tour de force.\" It was a Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers Selection.  Many reviewers highlighted the \"snippets\" style of the book as both a highlight and, while a few said it was an initial annoyance. A reviewer for the Wall Street Journal commented that Dau's writing was occasionally flat, but that he also \"beautifully addresses a need to emotionally engage with a war that has been going on for 10 years but that so often feels remote and unreal\".\nFreeman, John. \"'The Book of Jonas' by Stephen Dau  Searing tale stalks a damaged young Muslim war refugee in America\".

Sphere is a 1987 novel by Michael Crichton, his sixth novel under his own name and his sixteenth overall. It was adapted into the film Sphere in 1998.\nThe story follows Norman Johnson, a psychologist engaged by the United States Navy, who joins a team of scientists assembled to examine a spacecraft of unknown origin discovered on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The novel begins as a science fiction story but quickly transforms into a psychological thriller, developing into an exploration of the nature of the human imagination.\nNorman Johnson is the protagonist and a psychologist who, years earlier, was responsible for defining the operational procedures should the US ever come into contact with alien life - although he admits that he treated the request to do so as a joke at the time.\nThese procedures were outlined in a report entitled Recommendations for the Human Contact Team to Interact With Unknown Life Forms, often abbreviated ULF. Despite being the least physically fit team member in the context of an underwater habitat, he is arguably the most level-headed of the group. Nonetheless, Johnson takes time and trouble to convince the group to collaborate.\nHarold \"Harry\" Adams is a young, intelligent, African-American mathematician. While intellectually gifted and professionally secure, he is arrogant, unsympathetic, disdainful, and often uncooperative with the others, as a legacy of growing up as a mathematical prodigy who was often picked on as a child because of his lack of athletic talent.\nElizabeth Halpern is a biochemist who is muscular yet sometimes gentle and caring while simultaneously fierce, combative, and confrontational. She perceives herself as being dominated by the male scientists.\nTheodore Fielding is an astrophysicist and an enthusiastic opportunist, whose pretensions tend to cause conflict in his relationships with the others, despite his good intentions. It is later revealed his ambition is driven by anxiety and a conviction he has to achieve fame and do so fast, because he believes that the time for him to do so is fast running out.\nArthur Levine is marine biologist and the sole member of the team not chosen by Norman. He is also the only team member who doesn't make the descent to the crash site.\nHarold C. Barnes is a retired Navy captain who has charge of the underwater scientific investigation. He is brusque, impatient, and distrustful - possibly as a result of his military background. This leads to conflicts with the other main characters. He withholds crucial information from the team and his crew, following his own agenda at the expense of the others with tragic consequences.\nAlice \"Teeny\" Fletcher is a Navy chief petty officer in charge of maintaining the habitat. She is friendly and competent, despite Norman's initial scepticism. It is not specifically explained how she dies, but the survivors find a trail of blood and one of her shoes after the second giant squid attack.\nTina Chan is a Navy petty officer and electronics technician who is in charge of communications. She develops a friendship with Halpern, and is one of the longest surviving Navy personnel killed by the manifestations.\nRose Levy is a Navy seaman who serves as the habitat's cook.\nJane Edmunds is a Navy petty officer and data processing technician who serves as the operation's archivist. She is responsible for recording events and transferring the tapes to the submarine at DH-7, which is pre-programmed to return to the surface if not reset before a failsafe 12-hour countdown reaches 0, intended to ensure that at the very least a partial record will survive in case of catastrophe.\nCrichton began writing the novel in 1967 as a companion piece to The Andromeda Strain. His initial storyline began with American scientists discovering a 300-year-old spaceship underwater with stenciled markings in English. However, Crichton later realized that he \"didn't know where to go with it\" and put off completing the book until a later date.\nThe idea of doing a story about contact with superior intelligence, a time-honored theme, is that it's very hard if you stop and think about it. Most writers evade the issue by making the aliens recognizably human. It's 9 feet tall with spiky teeth and it wants to eat you. Or its 3 feet tall and it wants to hug you. In either case its humanlike... What's more likely about first contact with an extraterrestrial is that the alien wouldn't look humanlike at all. You might not even be able to see it or detect it.

Sahara is a 1992 adventure novel by Clive Cussler. It is the eleventh book in Cussler's Dirk Pitt series. The 2005 film Sahara was based on the novel.\nIn 2005 Director Breck Eisner filmed an adaptation of the novel, starring Matthew McConaughey as Dirk Pitt, Steve Zahn as Al Giordino, and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as Eva Rojas. The film had a rather large production budget of $145,000,000 and eventually grossed only $121,671,925, internationally. As such, although Philip Anschutz and Crusader Entertainment originally obtained the rights to adapt a number of Cussler's books, it is doubtful that more will be made.\nAdditionally, due largely to contract interpretation regarding Cussler's authority over the adapted screenplay, he ultimately sued Crusader Entertainment. Amid litigation, Crusader eventually brought charges back upon Cussler, claiming he personally hindered the film's publicity and performance, as well as provided false information in the original contract.\nCussler lost the decision when the jury found he acted unfairly and in breach of contract. Crusader was awarded $5 million from Cussler who was found to have violated a \"covenant of good faith.\" A California Court of Appeals decision later overturned the $5 million award.\nThe film had several alterations from the original novel, including but not limited to the removal of the events at Tebezza and the almost complete omission of the \"Kitty Mannock\" backstory, which did not test well in pre-release screenings.  The stand made at the original Fort Foureau was also omitted. However, in a 2003 ReadersRoom interview, Cussler accepted the fact scenes needed to be removed for the production of a two-hour film.\n\"Sahara\". Publishers Weekly.\n\"Sahara\".

In December 1944, the commanding officer of the I-403, a Japanese I-400 class submarine, is given orders to launch a mysterious attack on the United States, a mission involving Japan\u2019s notorious biological warfare group, Unit 731.  The I-403 reaches the U.S. northwest coast, but is sunk before the mission can be carried out.\nIn May 2007, 62 years later, a team of CDC researchers, including beautiful field epidemiologist Sarah Matson, are unexpectedly infected by a deadly and mystery illness in the Aleutian islands; they are rescued by Dirk Pitt Jr. (hereinafter Pitt Jr.), who is nearby on a NUMA research vessel.  Pitt Jr, with friend and coworker Jack Dahlgren, return to the site to investigate, but their helicopter is downed by gunfire from a mysterious trawler.  They survive, eventually determining that the illness resulted from a toxic compound of cyanide and smallpox.\nIn Japan, the U.S. ambassador is golfing with his British counterpart when he is assassinated by a sniper named Tongju.  Tongju later assassinates the ambassador\u2019s deputy and a semiconductor executive, leaving clues that appear to identify him as a member of a Japanese terrorist group.\nInvestigating the toxin, Pitt Jr. consults marine-history researcher St. Julien Perlmutter, who finds records of the I-403.  Pitt Jr. and Dahlgren find and dive on the sunken I-403, but its mysterious ordnance has been removed.  Meanwhile, in the Philippines, Dirk Pitt senior (hereinafter referred to simply as Dirk) and his friend and colleague Al Giordino are also discovering forgotten Japanese ordnance that is poisoning marine life.\nIn Incheon, South Korea, Dae-jong Kang, a multi-millionaire industrialist, is secretly a North Korean sleeper agent who has been using corruption to press for rapid reunification of the divided peninsula under the DPRK's rule. Kang reviews his plans with his assistant; they include framing a U.S. serviceman for the murder of a South Korean girl to foment unrest, while Tongju retrieves more of the World War II toxin from a second sunken submarine.  Learning of the interference of Pitt Jr., Kang sends assassins to eliminate him.\nThe assassins track down but fail to kill Pitt Jr and Matson on Vashon Island in Washington; Pitt Jr. is just able to jump his recently purchased 1958 Chrysler 300-D convertible aboard the Vashon Island Ferry, while Kang\u2019s assassins crash their car and drown.\nNUMA researcher Hiram Yeager has discovered that the toxic ordnance was also carried by a Japanese submarine lost in the South China Sea.  Pitt Jr. joins his sister Summer and father aboard a NUMA salvage vessel that locates the wreck, but Tongju and his commando team seize the vessel. After taking the recovered toxin and kidnapping Pitt Jr and Summer, the North Koreans sabotage the salvage ship and leave the imprisoned crew to drown, but Dirk is able to help everyone escape.\nPitt Jr. and Summer are taken to Kang\u2019s yacht, where the multimillionaire taunts them with a general threat of infecting the U.S. with the hybrid toxin, then leaves them to drown. They are able to escape (with the aid of Clive Cussler) and make their way back to the United States.\nUnaware of the exact nature of Kang\u2019s plan, the NUMA team coordinates with government agencies to search for cargo vessels that might be carrying the toxin.

The story follows Norman Johnson, a psychologist engaged by the United States Navy, who joins a team of scientists assembled to examine a spacecraft of unknown origin discovered on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The novel begins as a science fiction story but quickly transforms into a psychological thriller, developing into an exploration of the nature of the human imagination.",

A group of scientists (psychologist Norman Johnson; mathematician Harry Adams; zoologist Beth Halpern; astrophysicist Ted Fielding; and marine biologist Arthur Levine), along with U.S. Navy personnel, travel to a deep sea habitat at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, where an enormous spacecraft has been discovered.\nDuring the descent Levine becomes claustrophobic and is returned to the surface. The other scientists arrive safely at Habitat DH-8. After their arrival and subsequent pressurization to the habitat's exotic-gas environment, the Navy sends a robot to enter the spacecraft first, which locates and opens a panel near the spacecraft door.\nAs the robot's cameras focus on the opened panel, labels in English indicate the spacecraft is actually a U.S. spacecraft constructed in the future and sent through time, appearing on the seabed at least 350 years before its creation. The robot is unable to open a hatch leading further inside, forcing the team to don pressure suits and explore the spacecraft. In a large cargo hold, the team  discovers a mysterious spherical object that is clearly of extra-terrestrial origin.\nReasoning the ship's future builders were apparently unaware that it had already been found in their past, Adams becomes convinced that the team will not survive to report their discovery. Remaining behind after the rest of the team returns to the habitat, Adams succeeds in opening and entering the sphere. Meanwhile, on the surface, a Pacific cyclone forces the supporting Naval ships to evacuate, trapping and isolating the scientists on the ocean floor for five days. Adams is found and returned to the DH-8 Habitat where he awakens with a terrible headache and little-to-no memory of how he opened the sphere or what occurred while he was inside. Immediately afterwards, the team is contacted by an intelligent, seemingly friendly alien entity that calls itself \"Jerry.\"\nAt first, Jerry communicates with the scientists using a numeric code transmitted to the habitat's computer. While the team struggles to communicate with Jerry, increasingly bizarre and deadly events occur, including the appearance of impossible sea creatures that Halpern claims cannot exist (such as shrimp with no digestive organs), confirmed when Jerry informs them he is \"manifesting\" the creatures.\nAt this point, members of the team start to die in various attacks by giant squid, and the dwindling band of survivors struggle in their dealings with the unthinkably powerful, childlike, and temperamental alien entity. Johnson realizes he must use psychology to keep the remaining survivors alive namely Johnson, Adams, Halpern.\nAfter re-translating the original code, Johnson realizes by transposition the entity's name is \"Harry\" Adams. Johnson hypothesizes that the sphere is an object which allows a person's subconscious thoughts to manifest in reality, and Harry Adams has acquired the power through entering it.  This  is confirmed by his childhood fear of squid, especially the giant squid in the novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, manifested in the form of a vast number of small squid and later a giant squid that attacks the DH-8 Habitat.\nJohnson and Halpern sedate Adams and wait for contact to be re-established with the surface, but the manifestations continue. Halpern accuses Johnson of having entered the sphere and gaining access to the power. While unable to recall this incident, Johnson comes close to yielding, until he watches a security video of Halpern entering the sphere herself. Rejecting the notion, Halpern decides that Johnson is an imminent threat and defends herself by planting potent explosives around the spacecraft and habitat, and then attempts to suffocate Johnson by manipulating the habitat's life-support system.\nEscaping from the habitat, Johnson goes to the spacecraft and enters the presence of the sphere, then the sphere itself. Inside the sphere, he finds a large sea of translucent \"foam,\" and has a conversation in his thoughts with some sort of entity that speaks in cryptic riddles, who eventually tells Johnson that the greatest power humans possess is the ability to imagine things. After leaving the sphere, Johnson decides to escape using the submarine docked at Habitat DH-7, a nearby habitat for Navy personnel, but cannot abandon the other survivors. Now empowered in the same way as Adams and Halpern, Johnson returns to DH-8 and - using the submarine - the trio escape before the explosives set by Halpern count down and destroy the spaceship, the research habitat, and surrounding site.\nOn the surface, confined"

Strata is a 1981 science fiction comedy novel by Terry Pratchett. It is one of Pratchett's first novels and one of the few purely science fiction novels he wrote, along with The Dark Side of the Sun and The Nome Trilogy.\nAlthough it takes place in a different fictional universe and is more science fiction than fantasy, it could be said to be a kind of precursor to the Discworld novels, as it also features a flat Earth similar to the Discworld. It has been called a \"preconsideration\" of Discworld, though the plot and characters are modelled on (or parodies of) the novel Ringworld by Larry Niven.\nThe history of the protagonists' home-planet \"Earth\" in Strata unfolded very differently from the readers' Earth:\nNorth America is named Valhalla, and was colonised in the first millennium A.D. by Vikings, led by Leif Ericson;\nthe Roman Empire is known as Reme instead, after the other twin in the story of Romulus and Remus;\nthe planet Venus is orbited by a moon like Earth's Luna\nnone of the Abrahamic religions ever developed in its history (a mixture of Buddhism and folk religion seems to have predominated, punctuated by an assortment of flash-in-the-pan religious cults)\nhumans are much more developed in the field of space travel and has met several other intelligent species, such as the tall, frog-like Kungs, and the bear-like Shandi\nThe book implies that the reason for the historical discrepancies is that the readers' \"Earth\" is actually the replacement world created by Kin Arad for the inhabitants of the malfunctioning disc \"Earth\", to which the protagonists of the book travel early in the story. While the history and features of the flat \"Earth\" in Strata clearly is not the one we are familiar with, the history of the flat Earth is consistent with our own, up to the point where the expedition arrives.\nHumanity appears to be merely the latest of a long series of intelligent species who have evolved, altered the universe to better suit themselves, and then died out before the next species arose and started the cycle all over again. Before humans, there were the Great Spindle Kings, a race of acutely claustrophobic telepaths, who could live only a few hundred per planet and therefore built entire worlds from scratch to accommodate their population. Before them were the Wheelers, who were themselves preceded by increasingly alien races extending all the way back to the Big Bang.\nInterestingly, all of what is known about the intelligent species who have lived before humans is revealed to be incorrect near the end of the book, when the Disc's computer system (built by the universe's actual creators) reveals to Kin that the entire universe is only 70,000\u00a0years old and that evidence and remains of long dead civilizations were fabricated by the universe's creators to make the universe appear older than it is (much like the Company-fabricated prehistoric fossils on their created worlds to make them appear older than they really were). Finally, the fact that the computer systems on the disc \"Earth\" need humans, implies that the universe was itself created by humans as a place for themselves to live.\n\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 (Bulgarian)\nStrata (Czech)\nDelven (Dutch) (published together with The Dark Side of the Sun in one volume in 1982: republished separately as Strata in 1994)\nStrate-\u00e0-gemmes (French)\nStrata (German)\nDysk (Polish) (first edition was entitled \"Warstwy Wszech\u015bwiata\", Polish for \"Layers of the Universe\"; \"Strata\" means \"loss\" in Polish)\n\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 (Russian)\nThe Annotated Pratchett File v9.0 - Strata\nPratchett, Terry (1988).

Sahara is a 1992 adventure novel by Clive Cussler. It is the eleventh book in Cussler's Dirk Pitt series. The 2005 film Sahara was based on the novel.\nIn 2005 Director Breck Eisner filmed an adaptation of the novel, starring Matthew McConaughey as Dirk Pitt, Steve Zahn as Al Giordino, and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as Eva Rojas. The film had a rather large production budget of $145,000,000 and eventually grossed only $121,671,925, internationally. As such, although Philip Anschutz and Crusader Entertainment originally obtained the rights to adapt a number of Cussler's books, it is doubtful that more will be made.\nAdditionally, due largely to contract interpretation regarding Cussler's authority over the adapted screenplay, he ultimately sued Crusader Entertainment. Amid litigation, Crusader eventually brought charges back upon Cussler, claiming he personally hindered the film's publicity and performance, as well as provided false information in the original contract.\nCussler lost the decision when the jury found he acted unfairly and in breach of contract. Crusader was awarded $5 million from Cussler who was found to have violated a \"covenant of good faith.\" A California Court of Appeals decision later overturned the $5 million award.\nThe film had several alterations from the original novel, including but not limited to the removal of the events at Tebezza and the almost complete omission of the \"Kitty Mannock\" backstory, which did not test well in pre-release screenings.  The stand made at the original Fort Foureau was also omitted. However, in a 2003 ReadersRoom interview, Cussler accepted the fact scenes needed to be removed for the production of a two-hour film.\n\"Sahara\". Publishers Weekly.\n\"Sahara\".

In December 1944, the commanding officer of the I-403, a Japanese I-400 class submarine, is given orders to launch a mysterious attack on the United States, a mission involving Japan\u2019s notorious biological warfare group, Unit 731.  The I-403 reaches the U.S. northwest coast, but is sunk before the mission can be carried out.\nIn May 2007, 62 years later, a team of CDC researchers, including beautiful field epidemiologist Sarah Matson, are unexpectedly infected by a deadly and mystery illness in the Aleutian islands; they are rescued by Dirk Pitt Jr. (hereinafter Pitt Jr.), who is nearby on a NUMA research vessel.  Pitt Jr, with friend and coworker Jack Dahlgren, return to the site to investigate, but their helicopter is downed by gunfire from a mysterious trawler.  They survive, eventually determining that the illness resulted from a toxic compound of cyanide and smallpox.\nIn Japan, the U.S. ambassador is golfing with his British counterpart when he is assassinated by a sniper named Tongju.  Tongju later assassinates the ambassador\u2019s deputy and a semiconductor executive, leaving clues that appear to identify him as a member of a Japanese terrorist group.\nInvestigating the toxin, Pitt Jr. consults marine-history researcher St. Julien Perlmutter, who finds records of the I-403.  Pitt Jr. and Dahlgren find and dive on the sunken I-403, but its mysterious ordnance has been removed.  Meanwhile, in the Philippines, Dirk Pitt senior (hereinafter referred to simply as Dirk) and his friend and colleague Al Giordino are also discovering forgotten Japanese ordnance that is poisoning marine life.\nIn Incheon, South Korea, Dae-jong Kang, a multi-millionaire industrialist, is secretly a North Korean sleeper agent who has been using corruption to press for rapid reunification of the divided peninsula under the DPRK's rule. Kang reviews his plans with his assistant; they include framing a U.S. serviceman for the murder of a South Korean girl to foment unrest, while Tongju retrieves more of the World War II toxin from a second sunken submarine.  Learning of the interference of Pitt Jr., Kang sends assassins to eliminate him.\nThe assassins track down but fail to kill Pitt Jr and Matson on Vashon Island in Washington; Pitt Jr. is just able to jump his recently purchased 1958 Chrysler 300-D convertible aboard the Vashon Island Ferry, while Kang\u2019s assassins crash their car and drown.\nNUMA researcher Hiram Yeager has discovered that the toxic ordnance was also carried by a Japanese submarine lost in the South China Sea.  Pitt Jr. joins his sister Summer and father aboard a NUMA salvage vessel that locates the wreck, but Tongju and his commando team seize the vessel. After taking the recovered toxin and kidnapping Pitt Jr and Summer, the North Koreans sabotage the salvage ship and leave the imprisoned crew to drown, but Dirk is able to help everyone escape.\nPitt Jr. and Summer are taken to Kang\u2019s yacht, where the multimillionaire taunts them with a general threat of infecting the U.S. with the hybrid toxin, then leaves them to drown. They are able to escape (with the aid of Clive Cussler) and make their way back to the United States.\nUnaware of the exact nature of Kang\u2019s plan, the NUMA team coordinates with government agencies to search for cargo vessels that might be carrying the toxin.  However, the real plan goes forward as Tongju and his commando team pirate Sea Launch, a seaborne rocket-launching platform, preparing to fire a toxin-laden warhead at a G8 summit meeting in Los Angeles. When Dirk and Giordino spot the launch platform from a blimp, a deadly countdown is already underway. However, Dirk manages to infiltrate and alter the launch, resulting in the rocket crashing harmlessly into the sea.\nIn the final showdown, Pitt Jr. and a team of Navy SEALs infiltrate Kang's base as he prepares his final getaway aboard his luxury yacht. After an epic showdown, ignoring the chief SEAL, Pitt Jr. grabs him and jumps off the luxury yacht, letting it \u2013 and Kang \u2013 crash and explode into the North Korean side of the river.\n2004, United States, Putnam Adult, First Edition, ISBN\u00a0978-0399-15259-7, November 2004, Hardcover\n2006, United States, G.

                "description": "Strata is a 1981 science fiction comedy novel by Terry Pratchett. It is one of Pratchett's first novels and one of the few purely science fiction novels he wrote, along with The Dark Side of the Sun and The Nome Trilogy. Although it takes place in a different fictional universe and is more science fiction than fantasy, it could be said to be a kind of precursor to the Discworld novels, as it also features a flat Earth similar to the Discworld. It has been called a \"preconsideration\" of Discworld, though the plot and characters are modelled on (or parodies of) the novel Ringworld by Larry Niven.",

Kin Arad is a human planetary engineer working for \u201cthe Company\u201d, a human organisation that manufactures habitable planets using techniques and equipment salvaged from an extinct alien race, the \u201cSpindle Kings\u201d, who excelled at terraforming.\nThe express purpose of the Company\u2019s planet-manufacturing business is to create dispersed branches of humanity, diverse enough to ensure the whole species\u2019 survival for eternity. The Earth\u2019s population in the past has been decimated due to the lethal \u201cMindquakes\u201d, epidemic mass deaths caused by too much homogeneity among the populace.\nAll planets built by the Company are carefully crafted with artificial strata containing synthetic fossils, indistinguishable from the real thing. On occasion, however, mischievous Company employees often attempt to place anomalous objects in the strata as practical jokes, like running shoes, or other out-of-place artefacts, hoping to raise confusion among future archaeologists when the planets\u2019 beginnings have been long forgotten. However the Company forbids this, and secretly monitors the generated strata in order to detect embedded jokes, fearing such actions may cause the collapse of entire civilizations when the artifacts are eventually unearthed.\nKin and two aliens are recruited by the mysterious Jago Jalo for an expedition. One alien is a paranoid, four-armed, frog-like, muscular \u201cKung\u201d named Marco. The other alien is a bear-like \u201cShand\u201d, historian and linguist named Silver. Jago Jalo is a human who returned from a relativistic journey he embarked on more than a thousand years ago, where he made a stunning discovery: A flat Earth.\nWhen the team rendezvous with Jago Jalo on the Kung homeworld, the violent Jalo unexpectedly has a heart attack and dies. Kin Arad is shocked by the large store of weapons on-board Jalo's spaceship, and has misgivings about the expedition; Silver and Marco, however, see the possibility of reaping great technological rewards and launch the vessel on autopilot.\nWhen the expedition arrives at Jalo\u2019s pre-programmed coordinates, they find a flattened version of the medieval Eastern hemisphere of the Earth they had originally departed from, before their disturbing rendezvous with Jalo. Clearly artificial, the disc rotates around its hub, and is contained inside a gigantic hollow sphere with tiny artificial \u201cstars\u201d affixed to the interior, augmented with a small meandering artificial sun, moon, and fake planets revolving around it.\nTheir ship is hit by one of the \u201cplanets\u201d wandering on the interior of the sphere, so Kin, Marco, and Silver are forced to abandon ship. They land on the flat planet with the help of their \u201clift-belt\u201d equipped suits, while their ship crashes. A return from the flat world now seems impossible, but hoping for assistance from the disc\u2019s mysterious builders, Kin, Marco, and Silver set off towards a structure they had spotted at the disc\u2019s hub. It is the only thing on the flat \u201cEarth\u201d which does not match the geography of the spherical Earth they left.\nEn route, the team encounter the superstitious Medieval inhabitants of the disc, who believe the end of the world is near, due to increasingly chaotic climate (caused by the disc\u2019s machinery breaking down), the recent disappearance of one of their planets, and the general devastation caused by the ship's crash. The three travelers also discover a number of other differences.\nWhat Kin Arad knows as \u201cReme\u201d is called \u201cRome\u201d on the disc, and there is a strange \u201cChristos cult\u201d that is completely unfamiliar to Kin. Also, Venus is conspicuously lacking its giant (lunar-sized) moon \u201cAdonis\u201d, which dominates the sunset sky on the Earth Kin Arad came from, which was formative in leading humanity to an early heliocentric world view.\nSince only the Eastern hemisphere of Earth is represented, the continent of America is completely missing, so Kin, Marco, and Silver rescue a party of Vikings in the process of searching for Vinland, when their ship is about to sail over the edge of the world.\nThe flat world is apparently an extremely old and sophisticated automated system. In addition, there are real magical creatures and objects on the disc \u2013 Demons, and magic purses, and flying carpets \u2013 all of which, the travelers deduce, are themselves highly advanced, sophisticated technological constructs, just like the disc.\nThe travelers eventually reach the structure at the hub and make contact with the disc\u2019s automated control-systems. They are told that (aside from the recent damage) the sheer build-up of entropy in the old machinery has exceeded the capacity of its advanced robotic maintenance. Catastrophic failure threatens the disc\u2019s further existence. The machines offer to exchange their advanced technology for the construction of a"

The year is 1929, and newlyweds George and Serena Pemberton travel from Boston to the North Carolina mountains where they plan to create a timber empire. George has already lived in the camp long enough to father an illegitimate child by young Rachel Harmon but Serena is new to the mountains. Upon stepping off the train in Waynesville, George is confronted by Rachel's father, Abe Harmon, who is angry that George has abandoned his daughter. Abe attacks George with bowie knife. Ultimately George wins the battle and kills Abe. George also meets his business partners Wilkie and Buchanan at the train station and introduces them to his new wife, Serena.\nSerena will soon show herself to be the equal of any man, overseeing crews, hunting rattlesnakes, even saving her husband's life in the wilderness. Together, the Pembertons ruthlessly kill or vanquish all who fall out of favor. Meanwhile, Rachel Harmon struggles to take care of her son, Jacob. When Serena learns that she will never bear a child, she sets out to murder the son George fathered without her. Mother and child begin a struggle for their lives, and when Serena suspects George is protecting his illegitimate family, the Pembertons' intense, passionate marriage starts to unravel.\nIn the climax, Serena poisons George and leaves him to die in the woods. Desperately, he attempts to drag himself back to the lumber camp, certain that Serena will be waiting and that everything will be as it was before. Hearing the sound of light footsteps, George is certain that Serena has changed her mind and is returning for him. It is implied, though, that he is finished off by a panther.\nIn an epilogue set in 1975, an elderly Rachel Harmon reads a Life Magazine interview with Serena, who has prospered as a lumber baroness in Brazil, in a Seattle hospital. On his next visit, Rachel shows the interview to her son.\nSoon after, Serena and her henchman, Galloway, are murdered in their hacienda by an assailant armed with a knife. A guard comes on the scene as Serena was dying, however, and identifies her fleeing  killer as identical to an old photograph of George. The guard's account is discounted by the Brazilian police.\nSerena Pemberton - Protagonist and Pemberton\u2019s wife.

The book, with 50 chapters, follows Aami's ( Kamala ) life from age four through British colonial and missionary schools in Calcutta where she had to face racist discrimination; through the brutal and indulgent relationship with her husband; through her sexual awakening; her literary career; extramarital affairs; the birth of her children; and, finally, a slow but steady coming to terms with her spouse, writing, and sexuality. She mostly upholds her personal self in her autobiography rather than the political and social upheaval predominant during the war of independence in the then India.\nEnte Katha was serialised in 1972 in the now defunct Malayalanadu weekly, a literary magazine published by S. K. Nair. The novel not only created a literary sensation but even invited the wrath of Das' close relatives who wanted to stop its publication. V. B. C. Nair, the Editor of Malayalanadu recalls, \"Despite pressure from her influential relatives to stop the publication of the work, Kamala remained bold and it proved a roaring hit boosting the circulation of the weekly by 50,000 copies within a fortnight.\"\nDas had written My Story in English a couple of years back before it was rendered into Malayalam. At the time when she was penning down the memoir in English, S. K. Nair suggested her to translate it for his weekly. The novel was first published as a book by Current Books in February 1973. It is being published by DC Books from August 1982. The English version was published in the year 1976 by Sterling Publishers, with many changes made to the manuscript which she wrote in 1970. The book has been published by Harper Collins India since 2009. A Hindi translation titled Meri Kahaani is being published by Hind Pocket Books.\nMy Story remains one of the most popular and controversial autobiographies by an Indian author.\nPoet and litterateur K.

It has sincerity that strikes an immediate rapport with the reader.\"\nThe Hindu\n\"There are entire section that are marvelously written.\"\nDeccan Herald\n\"Among the best things I have read, it is the turbulent, self-indulgent but at all times, frank story of Kamala Das.\"\nAssam Tribune\n\"Kamala Das does not hide her secrets and does not follows the rules of old morality.\"\nThe Times of India\n\"The chapter headings accentuate the 'Excitement'.

                "description": "My Story (or Mon histoire) is a tell-all memoir by Canadian Julie Couillard. It was first written in French, then during summer 2008, translated into English. Both versions were published across Canada in October 2008. Couillard first appeared in the national media when she then dated the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maxime Bernier. The incident began in May 2008 over a NATO-related dossier at Couillard's house. Intended to be released on October 14, 2008, the book's release date was moved forward when that same day was selected for the Canadian federal election. Bernier dismissed the allegations against him in the book as ridiculous and the book faced negative publicity in Beauce, Bernier's riding. The English version peaked at No. ...",

Julie Couillard began dating Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament Maxime Bernier in April 2007. The media started covering her in August, when she wore a revealing dress to Bernier's swearing-in ceremony for his new position as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The couple had first met at a restaurant dinner with business associates. Couillard and Bernier dated until December 2007, but continued seeing each other until April 2008. Bernier later revealed to his constituents that he ended their relationship after the RCMP revealed Couillard's past to him, which he was unaware of. Historically, these types of incidents were not unique. However, their relationship became the subject of a political scandal, which brought about intense media attention. As the scandal unfolded, Couillard decided to write an autobiography to tell her side of the story. She formally signed a contract in July with publishers, McClelland & Stewart; and with the help of journalist, Serge Demers, a ghostwriter, she wrote My Story in French within a few months. The publisher translated the text into English.\nBernier was elected as a Conservative candidate in Quebec and became the Minister of Industry before being reassigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in August 2007. Though his relationship with Couillard had ended in December, they continued with occasional trysts.  In April 2008, as Bernier departed Couillard's home, he left a briefing book from the 2008 Bucharest summit.  Couillard put the briefcase containing the notes labelled confidential aside and forgot about them until May when she returned them to a foreign affairs office. Significant discussion about the affair was then voiced in both the House of Commons of Canada and the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security as to whether the affair was a threat to national security. However, Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper stated that their relationship was a private matter and dismissed it as a security threat.\nJournalist Chantal H\u00e9bert pointed out Couillard never had any criminal record and was not charged with criminal activity.  H\u00e9bert decried Denis Coderre and Gilles Duceppe for political opportunism and challenged their genuineness, suggesting they were more focused on their poll numbers in Quebec.  Jack Granatstein stated that some were \"puzzled\" about the incident since the secrets in the notes were considered the \"run-of-the-mill kind\". Bernier pointed out that the civil servant determines what parts of a document are classified and that releasing it would not cause any significant injury to national interest A former staffer for Bernier was critical of how the media handled Bernier's tenure with Foreign Affairs calling the reporting and Bernier's portrayal \"over sensationalized\". An internal government report dated 16 July 2008 conducted by the Department of Foreign Affairs found that disclosure of the notes would not have caused significant injury to Canadian interests.\nThe media revealed she had been convinced by a Kevlar Group to lobby Bernier in order to gain support for a $300-million lease by transferring 700 federal employees to a Kevlar building project in Quebec City.\nIt was expected that Bernier would be demoted, but he accepted blame for the incident and  offered his resignation as Minister of Foreign Affairs to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who accepted. A day later Couillard's interview  aired on TVA.  According to Couillard, Bernier's response to the subsequent media coverage made her feel betrayed and abandoned. However, a friend told Jane Taber that Bernier had plans to resign immediately but was told to wait it out by the government  who did not want him step down just before the Prime Minister was about to go to Europe or, blow up while the Prime Minister was on the plane.\nThe book begins as an autobiography. Couillard was born in the late-1960s in the Montreal district of Ville-\u00c9mard; she then moved to the suburb of Lorraine when she was four. Her parents often fought as her mother believed that her husband was unfaithful; the family incurred financial problems when Couillard's father changed careers. At age 12, Couillard was diagnosed with epilepsy. At age 17, she bought several properties with a boyfriend. They lived together briefly before breaking up and selling the properties. Couillard became a friend, then lover, of Gilles Gigu\u00e8re, a money lender who was associated with the controversial motorcycle club Hells Angels. In 1996, after the police raided Gigu\u00e8re's apartment and (according to Couillard) threatened him, Gigu\u00e8re became sullen and withdrawn: the"

The book, with 50 chapters, follows Aami's ( Kamala ) life from age four through British colonial and missionary schools in Calcutta where she had to face racist discrimination; through the brutal and indulgent relationship with her husband; through her sexual awakening; her literary career; extramarital affairs; the birth of her children; and, finally, a slow but steady coming to terms with her spouse, writing, and sexuality. She mostly upholds her personal self in her autobiography rather than the political and social upheaval predominant during the war of independence in the then India.\nEnte Katha was serialised in 1972 in the now defunct Malayalanadu weekly, a literary magazine published by S. K. Nair. The novel not only created a literary sensation but even invited the wrath of Das' close relatives who wanted to stop its publication. V. B. C. Nair, the Editor of Malayalanadu recalls, \"Despite pressure from her influential relatives to stop the publication of the work, Kamala remained bold and it proved a roaring hit boosting the circulation of the weekly by 50,000 copies within a fortnight.\"\nDas had written My Story in English a couple of years back before it was rendered into Malayalam. At the time when she was penning down the memoir in English, S. K. Nair suggested her to translate it for his weekly. The novel was first published as a book by Current Books in February 1973. It is being published by DC Books from August 1982. The English version was published in the year 1976 by Sterling Publishers, with many changes made to the manuscript which she wrote in 1970. The book has been published by Harper Collins India since 2009. A Hindi translation titled Meri Kahaani is being published by Hind Pocket Books.\nMy Story remains one of the most popular and controversial autobiographies by an Indian author.\nPoet and litterateur K. Satchidanandan said, \"I cannot think of any other Indian autobiography that so honestly captures a woman's inner life in all its sad solitude, its desperate longing for real love and its desire for transcendence, its tumult of colours and its turbulent poetry.\"\nFor Jaydeep Sarangi, doyen Indian English critic, Das was a champion voice of 'confessional poetry'. \nOther reviews and comments\nSunday Standard:\n\"It is a straightforward story.. It has sincerity that strikes an immediate rapport with the reader.\"\nThe Hindu\n\"There are entire section that are marvelously written.\"\nDeccan Herald\n\"Among the best things I have read, it is the turbulent, self-indulgent but at all times, frank story of Kamala Das.\"\nAssam Tribune\n\"Kamala Das does not hide her secrets and does not follows the rules of old morality.\"\nThe Times of India\n\"The chapter headings accentuate the 'Excitement'.

My Story covers much of Gillard's political career as the Federal Parliamentary Member for Lalor from 1998 to 2013. The autobiography's focal point is Gillard's rise to power within the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Parliament, as the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia following the 2007 federal election, and her tumultuous tenure as Prime Minister following the 2010 Australian Labor Party leadership spill against Labor leader and then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Her memoir analyses her achievements and recognises the failures of the Gillard Government.\nGillard is critical of Rudd and his supporters for what she believed was their constant undermining of her prime ministership which led to two unsuccessful leadership challenges throughout her tenure, followed by a successful leadership spill in June 2013, which saw her ousted as Prime Minister and replaced by Rudd. The Liberal\u2013National Coalition, led by then-Opposition Leader Tony Abbott also received criticism for their \"hostile\" and \"negative\" approach to opposition; Gillard detailed her motivations and reactions towards to the 2012 Misogyny Speech she delivered, in which she accused Abbott of sexism and misogyny.\nThe memoir is split into two sections. The first section, entitled \"How I Did It\", comprises the circumstances in how she challenged Rudd for the leadership of the Labor Party, as well the issues she faced during her governance. The second and longer section of the autobiography, \"Why I Did It\", details her life and the policy achievements of her government.\nSince its release in 2014, Gillard has released new editions of My Story, as to encapsulate related events which had since occurred post her prime-ministership, such as the leadership spills within the Liberal Party of Australia, which saw the demise of Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the election of Malcolm Turnbull as leader of the Liberal Party, and Prime Minister of Australia in September 2015.\nThe 504-page political memoir was released in September 2014 by Random House, almost a year and a half after Gillard's departure from Australian politics. The former Governor-General of Australia, Dame Quentin Bryce (2008\u20132014), launched the book at an event that was attended by various Labor party figures, including Gillard's former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan, Greg Combet, Craig Emerson, Tanya Plibersek, Kate Ellis, Tony Burke; in addition to former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and former state premiers, Anna Bligh (Queensland), John Brumby (Victoria) and Kristina Keneally (New South Wales).\nGillard's memoirs sold 5,000 copies during its first week, according to Random House.\nIn response to Gillard's criticism of his leadership and his conduct following the 2010 leadership challenge, Rudd released a statement. In it, his media spokeswoman said, \"Consistent with the past, Mr Rudd has no substantive comment to make on Ms Gillard's latest contribution to Australian fiction ... The Australian people have long reached their own conclusions about Ms Gillard's relationship with the truth \u2013 from the coup to the carbon tax. They have also reached their own conclusions on Ms Gillard's continuing efforts to reconstruct a justification after the event for her actions in June 2010, by trying to dress up personal political ambition as some higher purpose for the party and the government.\"\nThe book received generally favourable reviews, with The Conversation noting \"For those looking for a tell-all confession of the life and loves of Julia Gillard, My Story will disappoint. For readers seeking Gillard's views of the first Rudd government and the rise and fall of her own government, there is plenty of meat here.\" Feminist and writer Anne Summers praised the autobiography for its knowledge on the mechanisms of government in a review with The Australian, \"As a primer on how government works, My Story is on a par with the cabinet diaries of Clyde Cameron, Peter Howson, Neal Blewett and Gareth Evans. It's as comprehensive, but more personal, than [Prime Minister John Howard's] Lazarus Rising.\" In 2015, Gillard's memoir was shortlisted for the category of 2015 Biography of the Year by the Australian Book Industry Awards.\nMy Story was the highest selling politics-related book in 2014, selling 62,000 copies.\nIn the book, Senator Nick Xenophon was said to have been '\"infamously excluded from university for a period as punishment for stuffing a ballot box full of voting papers he had somehow procured\", which was denied by Xenophon. In February 2015, Random House issued a public apology to Xenophon and paid a confidential cash settlement. Xenophon continued to request a personal apology from Gillard.

The book, with 50 chapters, follows Aami's ( Kamala ) life from age four through British colonial and missionary schools in Calcutta where she had to face racist discrimination; through the brutal and indulgent relationship with her husband; through her sexual awakening; her literary career; extramarital affairs; the birth of her children; and, finally, a slow but steady coming to terms with her spouse, writing, and sexuality.

Julie Couillard began dating Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament Maxime Bernier in April 2007. The media started covering her in August, when she wore a revealing dress to Bernier's swearing-in ceremony for his new position as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The couple had first met at a restaurant dinner with business associates. Couillard and Bernier dated until December 2007, but continued seeing each other until April 2008. Bernier later revealed to his constituents that he ended their relationship after the RCMP revealed Couillard's past to him, which he was unaware of. Historically, these types of incidents were not unique. However, their relationship became the subject of a political scandal, which brought about intense media attention. As the scandal unfolded, Couillard decided to write an autobiography to tell her side of the story. She formally signed a contract in July with publishers, McClelland & Stewart; and with the help of journalist, Serge Demers, a ghostwriter, she wrote My Story in French within a few months. The publisher translated the text into English.\nBernier was elected as a Conservative candidate in Quebec and became the Minister of Industry before being reassigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in August 2007. Though his relationship with Couillard had ended in December, they continued with occasional trysts.  In April 2008, as Bernier departed Couillard's home, he left a briefing book from the 2008 Bucharest summit.  Couillard put the briefcase containing the notes labelled confidential aside and forgot about them until May when she returned them to a foreign affairs office. Significant discussion about the affair was then voiced in both the House of Commons of Canada and the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security as to whether the affair was a threat to national security. However, Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper stated that their relationship was a private matter and dismissed it as a security threat.\nJournalist Chantal H\u00e9bert pointed out Couillard never had any criminal record and was not charged with criminal activity.  H\u00e9bert decried Denis Coderre and Gilles Duceppe for political opportunism and challenged their genuineness, suggesting they were more focused on their poll numbers in Quebec.  Jack Granatstein stated that some were \"puzzled\" about the incident since the secrets in the notes were considered the \"run-of-the-mill kind\". Bernier pointed out that the civil servant determines what parts of a document are classified and that releasing it would not cause any significant injury to national interest A former staffer for Bernier was critical of how the media handled Bernier's tenure with Foreign Affairs calling the reporting and Bernier's portrayal \"over sensationalized\". An internal government report dated 16 July 2008 conducted by the Department of Foreign Affairs found that disclosure of the notes would not have caused significant injury to Canadian interests.\nThe media revealed she had been convinced by a Kevlar Group to lobby Bernier in order to gain support for a $300-million lease by transferring 700 federal employees to a Kevlar building project in Quebec City.\nIt was expected that Bernier would be demoted, but he accepted blame for the incident and  offered his resignation as Minister of Foreign Affairs to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who accepted. A day later Couillard's interview  aired on TVA.  According to Couillard, Bernier's response to the subsequent media coverage made her feel betrayed and abandoned. However, a friend told Jane Taber that Bernier had plans to resign immediately but was told to wait it out by the government  who did not want him step down just before the Prime Minister was about to go to Europe or, blow up while the Prime Minister was on the plane.\nThe book begins as an autobiography. Couillard was born in the late-1960s in the Montreal district of Ville-\u00c9mard; she then moved to the suburb of Lorraine when she was four. Her parents often fought as her mother believed that her husband was unfaithful; the family incurred financial problems when Couillard's father changed careers. At age 12, Couillard was diagnosed with epilepsy. At age 17, she bought several properties with a boyfriend. They lived together briefly before breaking up and selling the properties. Couillard became a friend, then lover, of Gilles Gigu\u00e8re, a money lender who was associated with the controversial motorcycle club Hells Angels. In 1996, after the police raided Gigu\u00e8re's apartment and (according to Couillard) threatened him, Gigu\u00e8re became sullen and withdrawn: the"

The book, with 50 chapters, follows Aami's ( Kamala ) life from age four through British colonial and missionary schools in Calcutta where she had to face racist discrimination; through the brutal and indulgent relationship with her husband; through her sexual awakening; her literary career; extramarital affairs; the birth of her children; and, finally, a slow but steady coming to terms with her spouse, writing, and sexuality. She mostly upholds her personal self in her autobiography rather than the political and social upheaval predominant during the war of independence in the then India.\nEnte Katha was serialised in 1972 in the now defunct Malayalanadu weekly, a literary magazine published by S. K. Nair. The novel not only created a literary sensation but even invited the wrath of Das' close relatives who wanted to stop its publication. V. B. C. Nair, the Editor of Malayalanadu recalls, \"Despite pressure from her influential relatives to stop the publication of the work, Kamala remained bold and it proved a roaring hit boosting the circulation of the weekly by 50,000 copies within a fortnight.\"\nDas had written My Story in English a couple of years back before it was rendered into Malayalam. At the time when she was penning down the memoir in English, S. K. Nair suggested her to translate it for his weekly. The novel was first published as a book by Current Books in February 1973. It is being published by DC Books from August 1982. The English version was published in the year 1976 by Sterling Publishers, with many changes made to the manuscript which she wrote in 1970.

Julie Couillard began dating Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament Maxime Bernier in April 2007. The media started covering her in August, when she wore a revealing dress to Bernier's swearing-in ceremony for his new position as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The couple had first met at a restaurant dinner with business associates. Couillard and Bernier dated until December 2007, but continued seeing each other until April 2008. Bernier later revealed to his constituents that he ended their relationship after the RCMP revealed Couillard's past to him, which he was unaware of. Historically, these types of incidents were not unique. However, their relationship became the subject of a political scandal, which brought about intense media attention. As the scandal unfolded, Couillard decided to write an autobiography to tell her side of the story. She formally signed a contract in July with publishers, McClelland & Stewart; and with the help of journalist, Serge Demers, a ghostwriter, she wrote My Story in French within a few months. The publisher translated the text into English.\nBernier was elected as a Conservative candidate in Quebec and became the Minister of Industry before being reassigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in August 2007. Though his relationship with Couillard had ended in December, they continued with occasional trysts.  In April 2008, as Bernier departed Couillard's home, he left a briefing book from the 2008 Bucharest summit.  Couillard put the briefcase containing the notes labelled confidential aside and forgot about them until May when she returned them to a foreign affairs office. Significant discussion about the affair was then voiced in both the House of Commons of Canada and the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security as to whether the affair was a threat to national security. However, Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper stated that their relationship was a private matter and dismissed it as a security threat.\nJournalist Chantal H\u00e9bert pointed out Couillard never had any criminal record and was not charged with criminal activity.  H\u00e9bert decried Denis Coderre and Gilles Duceppe for political opportunism and challenged their genuineness, suggesting they were more focused on their poll numbers in Quebec.  Jack Granatstein stated that some were \"puzzled\" about the incident since the secrets in the notes were considered the \"run-of-the-mill kind\". Bernier pointed out that the civil servant determines what parts of a document are classified and that releasing it would not cause any significant injury to national interest A former staffer for Bernier was critical of how the media handled Bernier's tenure with Foreign Affairs calling the reporting and Bernier's portrayal \"over sensationalized\". An internal government report dated 16 July 2008 conducted by the Department of Foreign Affairs found that disclosure of the notes would not have caused significant injury to Canadian interests.\nThe media revealed she had been convinced by a Kevlar Group to lobby Bernier in order to gain support for a $300-million lease by transferring 700 federal employees to a Kevlar building project in Quebec City.\nIt was expected that Bernier would be demoted, but he accepted blame for the incident and  offered his resignation as Minister of Foreign Affairs to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who accepted. A day later Couillard's interview  aired on TVA.  According to Couillard, Bernier's response to the subsequent media coverage made her feel betrayed and abandoned. However, a friend told Jane Taber that Bernier had plans to resign immediately but was told to wait it out by the government  who did not want him step down just before the Prime Minister was about to go to Europe or, blow up while the Prime Minister was on the plane.\nThe book begins as an autobiography. Couillard was born in the late-1960s in the Montreal district of Ville-\u00c9mard; she then moved to the suburb of Lorraine when she was four. Her parents often fought as her mother believed that her husband was unfaithful; the family incurred financial problems when Couillard's father changed careers. At age 12, Couillard was diagnosed with epilepsy. At age 17, she bought several properties with a boyfriend. They lived together briefly before breaking up and selling the properties. Couillard became a friend, then lover, of Gilles Gigu\u00e8re, a money lender who was associated with the controversial motorcycle club Hells Angels. In 1996, after the police raided Gigu\u00e8re's apartment and (according to Couillard) threatened him, Gigu\u00e8re became sullen and withdrawn: the"

My Story covers much of Gillard's political career as the Federal Parliamentary Member for Lalor from 1998 to 2013. The autobiography's focal point is Gillard's rise to power within the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Parliament, as the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia following the 2007 federal election, and her tumultuous tenure as Prime Minister following the 2010 Australian Labor Party leadership spill against Labor leader and then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Her memoir analyses her achievements and recognises the failures of the Gillard Government.\nGillard is critical of Rudd and his supporters for what she believed was their constant undermining of her prime ministership which led to two unsuccessful leadership challenges throughout her tenure, followed by a successful leadership spill in June 2013, which saw her ousted as Prime Minister and replaced by Rudd. The Liberal\u2013National Coalition, led by then-Opposition Leader Tony Abbott also received criticism for their \"hostile\" and \"negative\" approach to opposition; Gillard detailed her motivations and reactions towards to the 2012 Misogyny Speech she delivered, in which she accused Abbott of sexism and misogyny.\nThe memoir is split into two sections. The first section, entitled \"How I Did It\", comprises the circumstances in how she challenged Rudd for the leadership of the Labor Party, as well the issues she faced during her governance. The second and longer section of the autobiography, \"Why I Did It\", details her life and the policy achievements of her government.\nSince its release in 2014, Gillard has released new editions of My Story, as to encapsulate related events which had since occurred post her prime-ministership, such as the leadership spills within the Liberal Party of Australia, which saw the demise of Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the election of Malcolm Turnbull as leader of the Liberal Party, and Prime Minister of Australia in September 2015.\nThe 504-page political memoir was released in September 2014 by Random House, almost a year and a half after Gillard's departure from Australian politics. The former Governor-General of Australia, Dame Quentin Bryce (2008\u20132014), launched the book at an event that was attended by various Labor party figures, including Gillard's former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan, Greg Combet, Craig Emerson, Tanya Plibersek, Kate Ellis, Tony Burke; in addition to former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and former state premiers, Anna Bligh (Queensland), John Brumby (Victoria) and Kristina Keneally (New South Wales).\nGillard's memoirs sold 5,000 copies during its first week, according to Random House.\nIn response to Gillard's criticism of his leadership and his conduct following the 2010 leadership challenge, Rudd released a statement. In it, his media spokeswoman said, \"Consistent with the past, Mr Rudd has no substantive comment to make on Ms Gillard's latest contribution to Australian fiction ... The Australian people have long reached their own conclusions about Ms Gillard's relationship with the truth \u2013 from the coup to the carbon tax. They have also reached their own conclusions on Ms Gillard's continuing efforts to reconstruct a justification after the event for her actions in June 2010, by trying to dress up personal political ambition as some higher purpose for the party and the government.\"\nThe book received generally favourable reviews, with The Conversation noting \"For those looking for a tell-all confession of the life and loves of Julia Gillard, My Story will disappoint. For readers seeking Gillard's views of the first Rudd government and the rise and fall of her own government, there is plenty of meat here.\" Feminist and writer Anne Summers praised the autobiography for its knowledge on the mechanisms of government in a review with The Australian, \"As a primer on how government works, My Story is on a par with the cabinet diaries of Clyde Cameron, Peter Howson, Neal Blewett and Gareth Evans. It's as comprehensive, but more personal, than [Prime Minister John Howard's] Lazarus Rising.\" In 2015, Gillard's memoir was shortlisted for the category of 2015 Biography of the Year by the Australian Book Industry Awards.\nMy Story was the highest selling politics-related book in 2014, selling 62,000 copies.\nIn the book, Senator Nick Xenophon was said to have been '\"infamously excluded from university for a period as punishment for stuffing a ballot box full of voting papers he had somehow procured\", which was denied by Xenophon. In February 2015, Random House issued a public apology to Xenophon and paid a confidential cash settlement. Xenophon continued to request a personal apology from Gillard. On 6 August 2015, Gillard published a personal"

Julie Couillard began dating Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament Maxime Bernier in April 2007. The media started covering her in August, when she wore a revealing dress to Bernier's swearing-in ceremony for his new position as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The couple had first met at a restaurant dinner with business associates. Couillard and Bernier dated until December 2007, but continued seeing each other until April 2008. Bernier later revealed to his constituents that he ended their relationship after the RCMP revealed Couillard's past to him, which he was unaware of. Historically, these types of incidents were not unique. However, their relationship became the subject of a political scandal, which brought about intense media attention. As the scandal unfolded, Couillard decided to write an autobiography to tell her side of the story. She formally signed a contract in July with publishers, McClelland & Stewart; and with the help of journalist, Serge Demers, a ghostwriter, she wrote My Story in French within a few months. The publisher translated the text into English.\nBernier was elected as a Conservative candidate in Quebec and became the Minister of Industry before being reassigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in August 2007. Though his relationship with Couillard had ended in December, they continued with occasional trysts.  In April 2008, as Bernier departed Couillard's home, he left a briefing book from the 2008 Bucharest summit.  Couillard put the briefcase containing the notes labelled confidential aside and forgot about them until May when she returned them to a foreign affairs office. Significant discussion about the affair was then voiced in both the House of Commons of Canada and the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security as to whether the affair was a threat to national security. However, Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper stated that their relationship was a private matter and dismissed it as a security threat.\nJournalist Chantal H\u00e9bert pointed out Couillard never had any criminal record and was not charged with criminal activity.  H\u00e9bert decried Denis Coderre and Gilles Duceppe for political opportunism and challenged their genuineness, suggesting they were more focused on their poll numbers in Quebec.  Jack Granatstein stated that some were \"puzzled\" about the incident since the secrets in the notes were considered the \"run-of-the-mill kind\". Bernier pointed out that the civil servant determines what parts of a document are classified and that releasing it would not cause any significant injury to national interest A former staffer for Bernier was critical of how the media handled Bernier's tenure with Foreign Affairs calling the reporting and Bernier's portrayal \"over sensationalized\". An internal government report dated 16 July 2008 conducted by the Department of Foreign Affairs found that disclosure of the notes would not have caused significant injury to Canadian interests.\nThe media revealed she had been convinced by a Kevlar Group to lobby Bernier in order to gain support for a $300-million lease by transferring 700 federal employees to a Kevlar building project in Quebec City.\nIt was expected that Bernier would be demoted, but he accepted blame for the incident and  offered his resignation as Minister of Foreign Affairs to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who accepted. A day later Couillard's interview  aired on TVA.  According to Couillard, Bernier's response to the subsequent media coverage made her feel betrayed and abandoned. However, a friend told Jane Taber that Bernier had plans to resign immediately but was told to wait it out by the government  who did not want him step down just before the Prime Minister was about to go to Europe or, blow up while the Prime Minister was on the plane.\nThe book begins as an autobiography. Couillard was born in the late-1960s in the Montreal district of Ville-\u00c9mard; she then moved to the suburb of Lorraine when she was four. Her parents often fought as her mother believed that her husband was unfaithful; the family incurred financial problems when Couillard's father changed careers. At age 12, Couillard was diagnosed with epilepsy. At age 17, she bought several properties with a boyfriend. They lived together briefly before breaking up and selling the properties. Couillard became a friend, then lover, of Gilles Gigu\u00e8re, a money lender who was associated with the controversial motorcycle club Hells Angels. In 1996, after the police raided Gigu\u00e8re's apartment and (according to Couillard) threatened him, Gigu\u00e8re became sullen and withdrawn: the"

My Story covers much of Gillard's political career as the Federal Parliamentary Member for Lalor from 1998 to 2013. The autobiography's focal point is Gillard's rise to power within the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Parliament, as the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia following the 2007 federal election, and her tumultuous tenure as Prime Minister following the 2010 Australian Labor Party leadership spill against Labor leader and then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Her memoir analyses her achievements and recognises the failures of the Gillard Government.\nGillard is critical of Rudd and his supporters for what she believed was their constant undermining of her prime ministership which led to two unsuccessful leadership challenges throughout her tenure, followed by a successful leadership spill in June 2013, which saw her ousted as Prime Minister and replaced by Rudd. The Liberal\u2013National Coalition, led by then-Opposition Leader Tony Abbott also received criticism for their \"hostile\" and \"negative\" approach to opposition; Gillard detailed her motivations and reactions towards to the 2012 Misogyny Speech she delivered, in which she accused Abbott of sexism and misogyny.\nThe memoir is split into two sections. The first section, entitled \"How I Did It\", comprises the circumstances in how she challenged Rudd for the leadership of the Labor Party, as well the issues she faced during her governance. The second and longer section of the autobiography, \"Why I Did It\", details her life and the policy achievements of her government.\nSince its release in 2014, Gillard has released new editions of My Story, as to encapsulate related events which had since occurred post her prime-ministership, such as the leadership spills within the Liberal Party of Australia, which saw the demise of Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the election of Malcolm Turnbull as leader of the Liberal Party, and Prime Minister of Australia in September 2015.\nThe 504-page political memoir was released in September 2014 by Random House, almost a year and a half after Gillard's departure from Australian politics. The former Governor-General of Australia, Dame Quentin Bryce (2008\u20132014), launched the book at an event that was attended by various Labor party figures, including Gillard's former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan, Greg Combet, Craig Emerson, Tanya Plibersek, Kate Ellis, Tony Burke; in addition to former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and former state premiers, Anna Bligh (Queensland), John Brumby (Victoria) and Kristina Keneally (New South Wales).\nGillard's memoirs sold 5,000 copies during its first week, according to Random House.\nIn response to Gillard's criticism of his leadership and his conduct following the 2010 leadership challenge, Rudd released a statement. In it, his media spokeswoman said, \"Consistent with the past, Mr Rudd has no substantive comment to make on Ms Gillard's latest contribution to Australian fiction ... The Australian people have long reached their own conclusions about Ms Gillard's relationship with the truth \u2013 from the coup to the carbon tax. They have also reached their own conclusions on Ms Gillard's continuing efforts to reconstruct a justification after the event for her actions in June 2010, by trying to dress up personal political ambition as some higher purpose for the party and the government.\"\nThe book received generally favourable reviews, with The Conversation noting \"For those looking for a tell-all confession of the life and loves of Julia Gillard, My Story will disappoint. For readers seeking Gillard's views of the first Rudd government and the rise and fall of her own government, there is plenty of meat here.\" Feminist and writer Anne Summers praised the autobiography for its knowledge on the mechanisms of government in a review with The Australian, \"As a primer on how government works, My Story is on a par with the cabinet diaries of Clyde Cameron, Peter Howson, Neal Blewett and Gareth Evans. It's as comprehensive, but more personal, than [Prime Minister John Howard's] Lazarus Rising.\" In 2015, Gillard's memoir was shortlisted for the category of 2015 Biography of the Year by the Australian Book Industry Awards.\nMy Story was the highest selling politics-related book in 2014, selling 62,000 copies.\nIn the book, Senator Nick Xenophon was said to have been '\"infamously excluded from university for a period as punishment for stuffing a ballot box full of voting papers he had somehow procured\", which was denied by Xenophon. In February 2015, Random House issued a public apology to Xenophon and paid a confidential cash settlement. Xenophon continued to request a personal apology from Gillard.

Ladder of Years  is a 1995 novel by Anne Tyler.  It was a New York Times \"Notable Book\" and chosen by Time as one of ten best books of 1995.\nNat Moffat, Noah's grandfather, describes his retirement home, Senior City, to Delia: \"We're organized on the vertical. Feebler we get, higher up we live. Floor below this one is hale-and-hearty....Fourth floor is total care. Nurses, beds with railings....Something about the whole setup strikes me as uncomfortably, shall we say, symbolic.  See, I've always pictured life as one of those ladders you find on playground sliding boards-a sort of ladder of years where you climb higher and higher, and then, oops! you fall over the edge and others move up behind you.\"\nCathleen Schine  \"New Life for Old\", New York Times (May 7, 1995), writes, \"The French have said that William Wyler, the great director of movies like Dodsworth and The Best Years of Our Lives, had a \"style sans style.\" Anne Tyler has this same deceptive \"style without a style.\" Opening one of her books in the middle and picking a page at random, a reader might not immediately recognize her individual rhythm or idiosyncratic temperament. She does nothing fancy, nothing tricky. But so rigorous and artful is the style without a style, so measured and delicate is each observation, so complex is the structure and so astute and open the language, that the reader can relax, feel secure in the narrative and experience the work as something real and natural\u2014even inevitable.\"\nKirkus Reviews writes, \"All of Tyler's trademarks are here: comedy, the sweet, blunt edges of romance, and characters so perfectly, achingly drawn you can never decide whether they're the most oddball or most everyday people you've ever come across. Despite all this, Delia's story begins to feel slightly unfocused -- it pulls our sympathies every which way. There are allusions here to both King Lear and to fairy tales, but the ending to Delia's adventure is neither tragedy nor happily ever after, but something awkwardly in-between. Still, any journey with Tyler is always worth the ride -- and then some.\"\nCathleen Schine\nWilliam Wyler\nKirkus Reviews\nSchine, Cathleen (May 7, 1995)  \u201cNew Life for Old,\u201d New York Times.\nTyler, Anne (1995) Ladder of Years, New York: Ballantine Books, p. 193-4.\nKirkus Reviews (May 3, 1995) Ladder of Years, posted on line, May 20, 2010."

Avi conceived the idea for Poppy while living in Corvallis, Oregon, when his wife was a visiting professor at Oregon State University. At a university bookstore, he found a book written by a naturalist, who described his experience rescuing a baby owlet and nurturing it back to health and into the wild. Avi found the book \"fascinating\" and decided to write his own novel about an owl named Mr. Ocax. While developing the story, however, Avi's interest shifted towards the mouse that Mr. Ocax planned to eat, and the mouse eventually became the primary focus of the book. Both the book and the mouse were originally named Pip, but after discovering that another children's book existed about a mouse named Pip, he decided to rename the book and the character to Poppy.\nIn the Dimwood region, a large family of mice inhabit an abandoned farmhouse called Gray House. Poppy, a young deer mouse, dances with her boyfriend Ragweed, a golden mouse, on Bannock Hill. However, Mr. Ocax, a great horned owl who acts as a tyrannical ruler over the family, attacks them and kills Ragweed. When Poppy returns to Gray House, she learns that the family must relocate to New House, where the food is more abundant. However, Ocax refuses to give the family permission to move to the area, citing Poppy and Ragweed's refusal to ask his permission to go to Bannock Hill. His refusal makes Poppy curious, so she decides to travel to New House herself to investigate.\nIn Dimwood Forest, Poppy stumbles upon Ereth, a porcupine. Ereth agrees to protect Poppy from Ocax in exchange for the salt lick at New House that he can't obtain on his own. Ereth drops Poppy off at the boundaries of New House, where Poppy discovers that Ocax is afraid of a large artificial owl there. Armed with one of Ereth's quills, Poppy confronts Ocax about the figure but inadvertently reveals that it is fake. Ocax then attacks Poppy but is defeated when Poppy stabs him with the quill. Ocax slams into the salt lick pole, killing him and causing the salt lick to fall to the ground. Ereth retrieves the salt lick, and Poppy goes home to tell her family they are now free from Ocax and able to move. A few moons later she meets and marries Rye, Ragweed's brother. Each night they freely dance on Bannock Hill.\nIn 1996, Poppy received the Boston Globe\u2013Horn Book Award for fiction. In a 2017 blog post reflecting on Poppy, Avi wrote that Orchard Books, the original publisher of the book, had been \"foundering\", and as a result, bookstores were finding it difficult to obtain a copy of Poppy. Referring to the Horn Book Award, Avi wrote that it came in \"the proverbial nick of time\" and that he has \"absolutely no doubt that the award saved Poppy\", allowing him to write all the other books in the series. The novel was also listed on the American Library Association's (ALA) Notable Books for Children list in 1996.\nCarolyn Phelan, writing in the ALA's Booklist, called Poppy \"a good old-fashioned story with an exciting plot, well-drawn characters, and a satisfying ending\", noting themes of power among the novel's three main characters: Poppy, who finds courage; Ocax, who oppresses the mice family; and Ragweed, who criticizes Poppy for being cautious. Kirkus Reviews described Poppy as a \"cute, but rather standard offering from Avi\".

The story is set in a castle in the French countryside, during the Second French Empire. Sophie is a naughty little girl who lives with her parents, Monsieur and Madame de R\u00e9an. She is very curious and adventurous and keeps making blunders, though she is often reined in by the critical affection of Paul, her cousin, a good-hearted boy, always trying to show her the right track. Sophie's friends are Camille and Madeleine de Fleurville, \"really good\" little girls, whom Sophie does her best to imitate.\nThe success of Sophie's Misfortunes has been constant through the years and still goes on today; the book has been republished many times. Overseas, as well, it has been very successful. Vladimir Nabokov alluded to it in his novel Ada (1969), making up a novel called Sophie's Sophisms [Les Sophismes de Sophie] by a so-called \"Miss Stopchin\", as well Les Malheurs de Swann, a title which combines Countess of S\u00e9gur and Marcel Proust.

Harold Transome, a local landowner, has returned home after a fifteen-year trading career in the Middle East. Wealthy from trade, he stands for election to Parliament from the county seat of North Loamshire. But contrary to his family's Tory traditions, he intends to stand as a Radical. This alienates him from his traditional allies and causes despair for his mother, Mrs. Transome.

Felix Holt, the Radical (1866) is a social novel written by George Eliot about political disputes in a small English town at the time of the First Reform Act of 1832.\nIn January 1868, Eliot penned an article entitled \"Address to Working Men, by Felix Holt\". This came on the heels of the Second Reform Act of 1867 which expanded the right to vote beyond the landed classes and was written in the character of, and signed by, Felix Holt.\nSet during the time of the Reform Act of 1832, the story centres on an election contested by Harold Transome, a local landowner, in the \"Radical cause\" (\"Radical\" because Transome's version of \"radicalism\" isn't radical at all, but rather an application of the term to his politically stagnant lifestyle), contrary to his family's Tory traditions. Contrasting with the opportunism of Transome is the sincere, but opinionated, Radical Felix Holt. A subplot concerns the stepdaughter of a Dissenting minister who is the true heir to the Transome estate, but who is unaware of the fact. She becomes the object of the affections of both Harold Transome and Felix Holt.\nFelix Holt \u2013 Young, earnest and opinionated Radical recently returned to Treby Magna from a medical apprenticeship in Glasgow. Felix Holt prefers a life of working-class poverty over a life of comfortable wealth. He works as a watchmaker, supporting his mother and an adopted child, Job. Although not a churchgoer, he befriends the Dissident minister in Treby Magna, Rev. Rufus Lyon. Felix is initially disdainful of Rev. Lyon's refined daughter, Esther, but his attitude towards her eventually begins to soften and he falls in love with her. His earnest but imprudent actions earn the disdain of many Trebians, and land him in trouble during the election day riots.\nHarold Transome \u2013 35-year-old wealthy landowner recently returned to Treby from a 15-year trading career in the Middle East. He returns to England a widower with a young son, Harry. He runs for the county seat of North Loamshire in parliamentary elections as a Radical, contrary to his family's Tory traditions. Not long after his return to England, he discovers Jermyn's mismanagement of the Transome estate, and while using Jermyn as an electioneering agent, Harold Transome devises legal proceedings against him. The relationship between the two men deteriorates as the story progresses. Jermyn confronts him with information on a possible contestor to the ownership of the Transome estate. Harold Transome also takes a liking to Esther Lyon later in the story.\nEsther Lyon \u2013 Stepdaughter of the Dissenting minister in Treby Magna, Rev. Rufus Lyon. Esther earns a modest income as a teacher. She also has a refined sense of fashion and manners. Her refined appearance and behaviour appear repugnant to Felix Holt at first, but her developing earnestness softens his disdain. Learning that she is not Rev. Lyon's biological daughter does not diminish her filial affection, but rather it strengthens their relationship. Her new past brings her potential new wealth when she learns that she is the true heir to the Transome estate. Later in the story, Esther feels torn between Felix Holt and Harold Transome, both of whom are in love with her.\nRev. Rufus Lyon \u2013 Dissenting minister in Treby Magna, who has one stepdaughter, Esther. He befriends Felix Holt, a Radical. He also learns from Maurice Christian the possible identity of Esther's biological father. Throughout the story, the bond between his stepdaughter and him grows stronger, and he remains a helpful friend to Felix Holt.\nMatthew Jermyn \u2013 Transome family lawyer and former manager of the Transome estate. He agrees to act as Harold Transome's agent during county elections. However, after Transome discovers his mismanagement of the estate, Jermyn devises plans to stave off prosecution. He discovers a possible contestor to the ownership of the Transome estate, information which he tries to use against Harold. Jermyn also earns the disdain of John Johnson and Maurice Christian. He also holds one other secret from Transome.\nMrs. Transome \u2013 Mother of Harold Transome. Her husband's senility has left her in charge of the Transome estate while her sons are absent. Prior to the beginning of the story, her irresponsible oldest son has died, and she is eagerly anticipating her younger son's return to England. Harold Transome does return, but her expectations of their happy future life are dashed soon after. Her son treats her kindly but insensitively, and Mrs. Transome's despair over her changing situation deepens as the story progresses.\nMaurice Christian \u2013 Servant of Philip Debarry. He discovers and reveals critical information to various characters at different stages"

Flashman and the Dragon is a 1985 novel by George MacDonald Fraser. It is the eighth of the Flashman novels.\nPresented within the frame of the supposedly discovered historical Flashman Papers, this book describes the bully Flashman from Tom Brown's School Days. The papers are attributed to Flashman, who is not only the bully featured in Thomas Hughes' novel, but also a well-known Victorian military hero. The book begins with an explanatory note detailing the discovery of these papers.\nThe present novel takes place shortly after Flashman's service with John Brown in the United States (detailed in Flashman and the Angel of the Lord).  There is no explanation as to how he ends up in Hong Kong, but it is from here that he begins his adventures in China. Flashman meets both the leaders of the Taiping Rebellion and members of the Qing Dynasty who participated in the Second Opium War.\n\nHarry Paget Flashman - The hero or anti-hero\nReverend Josiah Carpenter\nMrs Phoebe Carpenter\nJames Hope Grant - British general and commander of the British forces during the Second Opium War. Flashman says, \"He wasn't much of a general; it was notorious he'd never read a line outside the Bible; he was so inarticulate he could barely utter any order but 'Charge!'; his notions of discipline were to flog anything that moved...But none of this mattered in the least because, you see, Hope Grant was the best fighting man in the world.\"\nFrederick Townsend Ward - American soldier of fortune and initial commander of the Ever Victorious Army. Flashman tries to shoot him at one point, but later says, \"while Gordon finished the Taiping business, it was young happy-go-lucky Fred who broke the ground for him.\"\nHong Xiuquan - Founder and leader of the Taiping Rebellion, referred to as Hung Hsiu-chuan. Flashman meets him at a time when his mind has deteriorated from excess debauchery, and refers to him as a \"raving, dangerous, dreadful madman, and one of the most diabolical powers ever loosed on a suffering world.\"\nHarry Smith Parkes - British diplomat\nJohn Arbuthnot Fisher - Midshipman when Flashman meets him on the Pearl River, but later Admiral of the Fleet.\nGarnet Joseph Wolseley - British army officer on Hope Grant's staff in China.\nCharles Montauban - Commander of the French forces during the Second Opium War.\nLord Elgin - High Commissioner to China and the ambassador whose job it was to go to Peking and see that the Treaty of Tientsin was honoured. He was also responsible for the destruction of the Summer Palace, which was vilified by many as an uncivilised act of vandalism. Flashman, however, liked him and called him, \"the shrewdest diplomatic of his day, hard as a hammer and subtle as a Spaniard.\" Flashman sees the destruction of the Summer Palace as a way of punishing the cruel and decadent court rather than the populace.\nJohn Moyse - the \"Private of the Buffs\" who refuses to kow-tow to a local mandarin. Flashman has no such scruples.\nLi Xiucheng - Military commander of the Taiping Rebellion, referred to as Loyal Prince Li.  Flashman says he could \"feel the force that had brought him in ten years from apprentice charcoal-burner and private soldier to the third place in the Taiping hierarchy...It was there, in the cold soft voice and hard unwinking eyes; he was a fanatic of course, and a formidable one.\"\nChen Yucheng\nHong Rengan - cousin of Hong Xiuquan and Prime Minister of the Taiping movement, referred to as Hung Jen-Kan.  Flashman calls him an \"extraordinary man\".\nCharles George Gordon - British army officer; Flashman meets him briefly during the destruction of the Summer Palace.\nHenry Loch - Secretary to Lord Elgin.\nFelice Beato - A semi-official photographer to the British forces of the expedition.\nPrince Yi\nSushun\nSengge Rinchen\nThe Xianfeng Emperor - Eighth emperor of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, referred to as Emperor Hsienfeng.\nEmpress Dowager Ci'an\nEmpress Dowager Cixi - Yehonala, the imperial concubine, when Flashman meets her. Flashman at one point refers to her as a monster, although he reconsiders and instead says, \"With Yehonala everything was extreme; whatever she did was done with every fibre of her, and enjoyed with sensual intensity - whether it was nibbling a sugared walnut, or half-killing a partner in bed, or flaunting a new dress, or having an offender flogged nearly to death...\" He later says she was one of three women he ever felt more than lust for (excluding Elspeth), the other two being Lola Montez and Rani Lakshmi Bai. She was also one of the three most beautiful people"

The Return of the Soldier is Rebecca's West's first novel. It was published in 1918 during World War I.\nThe novel begins as the narrator, Jenny, describes her cousin by marriage, Kitty Baldry, pining in the abandoned nursery where her dead first son would have been raised. Occupied with the domestic management of the Baldry estate just outside London, the two are almost completely removed from the horrors of war. The only exception is that Kitty's husband, Chris Baldry, is a British soldier fighting in France. While Kitty laments in the nursery, Margaret Grey arrives at the estate bringing news to the two women. When Jenny and Kitty meet her, they are surprised to find a drab middle-aged woman. And even more to their shock, Margaret tells them that the War Office notified her of Chris's injury and return home, not Kitty and Jenny. Kitty dismisses Margaret from the estate trying to deny that she could have been the recipient of such information.\nSoon after, another of Jenny's cousins notifies the two women that he in fact has visited Chris and that he is obsessing over Margaret, whom he had had a summer fling with 15 years before. Soon after, Chris returns shell-shocked to the estate believing he is still 20, but finding himself in a strange world which had aged 15 years beyond his memory. Trying to understand what is real for Chris, Jenny asks Chris to explain what he feels to be true. Chris tells her the story of a romantic summer on Monkey Island, where Chris at the age of 20 fell in love with Margaret, the inn-keeper's daughter. The summer ends with a rash departure by Chris in a fit of jealousy.\nAfter Chris tells this story, Jenny travels to nearby Wealdstone to bring Margaret back to help Chris understand the difference between his remembered past and reality. She arrives at Margaret's dilapidated terraced house to find her dishevelled and taking care of her husband. Jenny convinces Margaret to return with her to the estate to help Chris. Upon Margaret's return, Chris recognises her and becomes excited. Before returning to her home, Margaret explains that 15 years have passed since their Monkey Island summer and that Chris is now married to Kitty. Chris acknowledges this passage of time intellectually but cannot retrieve his memories and still pines for Margaret.\nMargaret continues to visit, and Jenny's initial dislike for the woman turns to friendship, gratitude, and eventually, near hero-worship as she realises that Margaret has an inner goodness that transcends her desperate appearance and class standing. Jenny recognises the artifice of the house she and Kitty have so painstakingly decorated for Chris is a poor substitute for the love and temporary home he finds in Margaret. Jenny spends a lot of the time lamenting her inability to be part of this Chris-Margaret inner sanctum. Jenny goes on at length describing the conflict between this grief over her lost closeness with her cousin and admiration for Margaret, Chris and their relationship.\nMeanwhile, Kitty continues to despair about Chris's memory loss and his attachment to Margaret. Unlike Jenny, she refuses to see Margaret and does not respect the truth that this new/old relationship is doing Chris some good. Truthfully, the only time Chris is happy is when he is with Margaret. Kitty is not satisfied that he cannot be cured and one day announces the impending arrival of a Dr Gilbert Anderson, a psychoanalyst. Dr. Anderson, expected to take a novel tack, arrives during one of Margaret's visits and questions the women. Margaret perceptively recommends a course of treatment: Margaret must confront Chris with the existence of his late son, Oliver, who died at age two, five years ago.  Margaret knows Chris will not be able to deny reality if he has to deny his child.\nJenny leads Margaret to the sad, well-maintained room where Oliver once lived. Margaret grieves for her own child whose death at the same age and time as Oliver's makes her feel a connection between the two. Amid this pain, Margaret and Jenny contemplate not \"curing\" Chris and instead letting him just be happy. But Jenny realises Chris will have no dignity if he has no truth and almost simultaneously, Margaret voices a similar thought.\nThe final scene of the book has Jenny watching from the house as Margaret confronts Chris with the truth of Oliver. Impatiently, Kitty wonders what is going on. Jenny recognises, even from a distance, that Chris' whole bearing has changed and he is no longer trapped in his youth. He is a soldier again, or as Kitty exclaims \"He's cured!\"  Jenny's silence on the subject leads us to reflect on whether this cure is really a good thing after all. He will lose the love of his life and have to"

Dear Nobody is a realistic young-adult novel by Berlie Doherty, published by Hamilton in 1991. Set in the northern England city of Sheffield, it features an unplanned teenage pregnancy and tells the story of its effect on the teenagers and their families.\nDoherty won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. Through 2012 she is one of seven writers with two such honors, having won the 1986 Medal for Granny Was a Buffer Girl. Also set in Sheffield, the earlier novel is a family saga whose point of entry is the Sheffield cutlery industry.\nOrchard Books published the first U.S. edition in 1992.\nDear Nobody has been translated into many languages, and the stage version is often performed.\nChristopher Marshall, usually called Chris, a student in his last year of school, planning to study English at Newcastle University\nHelen Garton, sometimes called Nell, Chris's girlfriend, also in her last year at school, and planning to go to music college in Manchester\nNobody/Amy, their baby\nChris's family\nAlan Marshall, Chris's father, an amateur potter\nGuy Marshall, Chris's younger brother\nJoan, Chris's mother, a professional photographer and climber, who left home when he was 10 to live with Don\nDon, Joan's partner, a keen climber\nJill, Joan's sister, who runs a riding stable near Sheffield\nHelen's family\nTed Garton, Helen's father, works in the university library and plays in a jazz band\nAlice Garton, Helen's mother, who works in a bank\nRobbie Garton, Helen's younger brother\nGrandad, Alice's stepfather, Helen's grandfather\nNan, Alice's mother, Helen's grandmother\nFriends\nTom, Chris's best friend\nRuthlyn, Helen's best friend\nBryn, a Welsh girl who grows close to Chris but cannot take Helen's place\nMenai, Bryn's friend\nBeside the 1991 Carnegie Medal for British children's books, Dear Nobody won the Japanese Sankei Children's Book Award in 1994.

The stage version won the Writers Guild of Great Britain Award in 1992.\nBeside English-language editions around the world, Dear Nobody has been translated and published in Bulgaria, Catalonia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Wales.\nDoherty describes the book as being essentially about love: \"It is about two young people who love each other, but it's also about family love, the ways in which love can go wrong, how sometimes it makes us do things that aren't sensible or that hurt people, how sometimes it turns to hate and drives people and families apart\".\nThe emotional intensity of the novel is well attested: \"I have never read a book that evokes so vividly how it feels to be a teenager in love\" Daily Telegraph; \"The aunt, parents, grandparents and siblings bring in various strands of subplot that give the book a satisfying complexity while losing nothing of the intensity of Helen and Chris's developing predicament and the building pressures they're under.\"\nJohn Murray's essay on the novel's narrative technique focuses on the novel as a literary artefact and discuses how its structure affects the reader.\nDear Nobody has been adapted as a BBC Radio 4 play, a theatre play and a television film for BBC produced by Andy Rowley and starring Sean Maguire and Katie Blake.  The playscript has been published by Collins in the Plays Plus series and it has been performed in schools and theatres around the world.\nDoherty is enthusiastic about the productions: \"I have seen so many interpretations of Chris and Helen and the other actors that I almost can't remember how I imagined my originals to be! I am just endlessly fascinated by the different ways of representing them, and always impressed by the actors' ability to bring the characters to life.\"\n\n\"Dear nobody\" (first U.S. edition).

The Return of the Soldier is the debut novel of English novelist Rebecca West, first published in 1918. The novel recounts the return of the shell shocked Captain Chris Baldry from the trenches of the First World War from the perspective of his cousin Jenny. The novel grapples with the soldier's return from World War I with mental trauma and its effects on the family, as well as the light it sheds on their fraught relationships.\nThough initially reviewed by critics, literary scholars treating West's work tended to focus on her later novels and dismissed The Return of the Soldier until the end of the twentieth century and beginning of the twenty first. The novel was adapted into a film of the same name in 1982, and later into a stage musical of the same name in 2014 by Charles Miller.\nThe Return of the Soldier is Rebecca's West's first novel. It was published in 1918 during World War I.\nChris Baldry is an upper class gentleman who chafes against the upper class expectations he is supposed to meet. According to critic Carl Rollyson, his amnesia reveals someone who has a suppressed \"romantic sensibility\". As Jenny comments in the book, he \"was not like other city men\"; he had a \"great faith in the improbable.\" Throughout the novel, Chris is treated simply as the \"soldier\" and is often not given a full examination by Jenny as the narrator, thus his character is flat, an individual stuck in his masculine function in society.\nKitty Baldry on the other hand, is neoclassical in her outlook. Instead of the romantic optimism which Chris exhibits throughout the novel, Kitty's life revolves around the \"proper forms\" of an upperclass performance. Obsessed with self-control, good breeding, manners and making life tidy and comfortable, Kitty creates a facade of happiness which she projects on Baldry Court.\nMargaret is a character cast in strong contrast with Kitty. A worn out lower-class woman, to whom the narrator Jenny is initially hostile, Margaret reveals herself as both thoughtful and aware, both revealing the illusions in Baldry Court to Jenny and supporting and expanding Dr. Anderson's analysis of Chris's psychological state.\nAs noted above, Jenny is the narrator of the story, the cousin (through marriage) to Kitty.\nWest's style in her early novels, including The Return of the Soldier, is characteristic of other British Modernist novelists. She uses a limited point of view, a non-linear narration, and offers themes of memory, sexual desire and the importance of nuanced detail. Temporal displacement and uncertainty pervade most of the novel, especially in the way Chris's shell shock displaces him, and subsequently the reader, during his story telling. This additional shift beyond simply the period at war in France reinforces the idea that his trauma could be linked to his marriage with Kitty, or any number of other events. Additionally, Chris's sense of time is repeatedly broken throughout the novel and communicated through Jenny.\nThe limited unreliable narrator in The Return of the Soldier is Jenny, who is cousin to Chris, the soldier whom the title evokes. As the novel develops, Jenny's sympathies and attention shift from Kitty to Margaret. This dual focus on Kitty and Margaret make the novel more about the women and less about Chris, the title character.\n\nThe title The Return of the Soldier embodies a common trope in Great War literature: soldiers return from war and interact with everyday life, confronting trauma sustained through the brutality of war. The Return of the Soldier is the first deliberate evocation of the returned soldier in literature. West's treatment of the returning soldier in The Return of the Soldier is deliberately distanced from the war. The trauma Chris suffers in The Return of the Soldier becomes an isolated piece of evidence of the war's effect on a society that appears to be otherwise functioning normally. This distance is very similar to the distance from war and its trauma in Virginia Woolf's Jacob's Room.\nThe successful treatment of the traumatised returned soldier is a fundamental element of The Return of the Soldier. Unlike Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway and Dorothy L. Sayers' The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club, other postwar novels which emphasise the lingering effects of war despite attempts at reintegration, The Return of the Soldier lends a certain optimism that the soldier can be reintegrated into society. West's novel depicts war trauma as curable.\nFreudian psychoanalysis and its tools for understanding the psychological state of an individual are important to the novel. Freud and the idea of psychoanalysis were popular during the time when West was writing the novel, and the focus on psychoanalysis is"

The main influence in fourteen-year-old Will Burrow's life is his father, Dr. Burrows, and together they share an interest in archaeology and a fascination for the buried past. When Dr. Burrows begins to notice strange 'pallid men' where they live in Highfield, and then promptly goes missing, Will and his friend Chester go search for him. They discover a blocked passageway behind bookshelves in the cellar of the Burrows home and re-excavated it, finding the passage leads to a door set into the rock, and beyond the door is an old lift that takes them down to another set of doors. A cobblestone street lies beyond, lit by a row of orb-like street lamps; houses that appear to be carved out of the walls themselves flank the street.\nThey are soon captured by the police of the underground community, known as the Colony. In prison, Will is visited by Mr. Jerome, and his son Cal. They reveal Will was actually born in the Colony, and that they are his real family; Mr. Jerome his father and Cal his younger brother. Will is eventually released from the prison and taken to the Jerome's home, where Will and Cal's Uncle Tam is delighted to see him and informs Will that his adoptive father, Dr. Burrows, was recently there, and had willingly traveled down into the Deeps \u2014 a place even deeper in the Earth than The Colony. Will learns that the Styx, the religious rulers of the Colony, are either going to enslave Chester or banish him to the Deeps to fend for himself. Will refuses to abandon his friend, and Uncle Tam formulates a plan for him to rescue Chester and to take him back to the surface.\nWill and Cal attempt to rescue Chester before he is sent to the deeps on the 'Miner's Train', but the Styx arrive and they are forced to leave Chester behind. During the botched escape attempt, it is revealed that Rebecca, Will's adoptive sister, is actually a Styx implanted in his family to monitor him. The boys head through a series of tunnels to the Eternal City, and old stone city, estimated by Will to be from Roman times, where the air is filled with deadly bio-toxins. They avoid the Styx soldiers, who patrol the city with their vicious stalker attack dogs and eventually emerge on the bank of the Thames. Will makes for his home in Highfield, but there Will's health deteriorates, so Cal helps him to his Auntie Jean's flat where he recovers. Soon they return underground to find Will's adoptive father and attempt to rescue Chester once again. They encounter another Styx patrol, and Uncle Tam kills a member of the Styx, whom he calls Crawfly, but is mortally wounded in the fight, and the strong-willed Uncle Tam chooses to stay behind to give the boys time to escape. With the help of Imago Freebone, a member of Uncle Tam's gang, Will and Cal escape to a small hiding place halfway between the Colony and the Eternal City. There, they rest and mourn for Uncle Tam; and are told by Imago that Chester's train to the deeps will pass directly under their hiding spot shortly. They jump down into the train through a hole in the floor of the hiding spot and find Chester. Together they ride down to the Deeps. In the book's epilogue, Rebecca kills Imago, who was hiding on the surface, by poison.\nThe novel was initially self-published under the title The Highfield Mole: The Circle in the Spiral on 17 March 2005, with a limited run of 500 hardback and 2,000 softback copies, financed by the sale of Roderick Gordon's house. The book received some trade press attention before launch and the entire hardback run sold within a day. On 19 November 2005, Barry Cunningham, of Chicken House, announced that he had agreed to publish The Highfield Mole and a second book in the series. Cunningham, while working for Bloomsbury in London, famously signed up J. K. Rowling, and this connection led to the book being branded \"the next Harry Potter\".\nThe authors and Barry Cunningham also decided to retitle the book Tunnels, to reflect that it had been changed by some limited editing. With the announcement of the publication date, and press coverage in the UK, the price of the original self-published books jumped dramatically, with one copy selling for \u00a3950. Tunnels was released in the UK as a softcover on 2 July 2007, and in the United States as a hardcover on 10 December 2007, and as a paperback on 1 February 2009. In Canada, the book was released as a paperback on 7 July 2007, as a hardcover on 1 January 2008, and a mass market paperback on 1 February 2009. In the United States, Tunnels had an initial printing of 100,000 copies. In February and March 2008 it"

Makani Young is still adjusting to her new life in the small town of Osborne, Nebraska. It has been one year since the inciting incident that caused her parents to send her away from Hawaii to live with her grandmother in the rural town. Though Makani befriends a few friends named Alex and Darby and even flirts with a romantic interest named Ollie at Osborne High School, she is still haunted by the secrets of her past life. However, all of that is put to the side when the students at her school start getting killed in a series of gruesome murders. As the terror grows closer and the hunt intensifies for the killer, the dark secrets of the past will finally be revealed.\nWithin hours of the brutal murder of Haley Whitehall, news of her death reaches her classmates at Osborne High in the morning, including new senior transfer Makani Young who attends the same school. Makani has been sent to permanently live with her grandmother in Osborne, Nebraska from Hawaii due to her parents' divorce as well as a past incident that she was involved back in her hometown. At this point, Makani has been in Osborne for a better part of the year and has made some friends in her town including Alex Shimerda and Darby. She even had a brief summer fling with the socially recluse, Ollie Larsson, who she still has feelings for, but their relationship ended suddenly and without explanation. \nAfter their fling ended, Makani decides to mend her relationship with Ollie but fails to reconcile at the start of the new school year. In the aftermath of Haley\u2019s murder, students at Osborne High are startled with her murder case. Shortly after, the rumour mill immediately takes off with some having suspicions of Ollie being the killer. Makani tries to reacquaint herself with Ollie again, this time with great success. The pair manage to pick up their relationship, where they left off in the summer but without the awkwardness that preceded their previous encounter. The pair hang out for a while but Ollie is called into work at Greeley's Foods, after another employee gets fired for stealing. Ollie also knows a lot about Haley's murder because his brother works for the police force. He divulges to Makani that he has overheard some conversations surrounding the case and also sifted through his brother's confidential files. \nWhen the shock of Haley\u2019s death is beginning to settle down, Matt Butler, another student at Osborne High is murdered, this time inside the school. Due to the recent murder cases, fear and suspicion spread across the entire town of Osborne. During Matt's murder investigation, every student and member of staff at Osborne High is questioned by the Osborne PD including Makani, but she is nervous, thinking that the police including Ollie\u2019s brother, Chris Larsson might uncover secrets from her past. \nAfterwards, Ollie and Makani head back to his house but before they can even leave the school grounds, a reporter grabs Makani. In response, Makani screams but then quickly leaves the scene with Ollie. After getting back to Ollie\u2019s, she looks into one of the files that Chris has left lying around and realizes the sheer level of violence and gore at Haley\u2019s murder. During her conversation with Ollie, she relays her concerns. Soon after, they have a moment, which is quickly interrupted by Ollie's brother, Chris who happened to notice them in the room at Ollie's place. After Chris leaves the room, Ollie and Makani later theorize that the killer might have a history with Matt and Haley. \nIn the wake of the third murder with Rodrigo's death, the police have no leads to follow but Makani and Ollie discuss the events and both realize that it must have been someone who knew Rodrigo. They arrive at the assumption due to noting how the killer was comfortable staying inside Rodrigo's house, hours after they murdered him, and knew information about his parents being away at the time. They also highlighted that Rodrigo didn't fit into a pattern and that he was a different type of victim unlike Matt and Haley, considering that he wasn't very popular and had a small group of friends. Later, this murder divides Makani\u2019s friendship group at her high school, as Darby and Alex still suspect that Ollie might be involved and after Rodrigo\u2019s death, Alex is even more likely to believe it since she had a crush on Rodrigo. \nA while later, the killer enters Makani's house, and decides to move around objects to psychologically torment her. When Grandma Young attends a sleep clinic, Ollie, and Makani head back to her place, but Makani realizes a few hours later that"

Protagonist Jethro Knights studies philosophy and sails around the world to promote indefinite life extension, desiring to live eternally through medicine, science, and technology. Love-interest and physician Zoe Bach, while sharing Knights' philosophical transhumanism, challenges him with her absolute belief in the afterlife, insisting that death is a part of life. Meanwhile, in America, transhumanists are being targeted and killed by Christian terrorists in cahoots with the popular anti-transhumanist Reverend Belinas.\nAfter his sailing trip, Knights suffers a devastating personal tragedy at the hands of Christian fundamentalists. At the same time, the United States Government becomes more theocratic and criminalizes transhumanist research, prompting Knights to build an independent floating city and sovereign state, Transhumania, so research can be continued. Governments around the world eventually grow afraid of the radical science being created on Transhumania, and attack the seasteading city. Transhumania successfully defends itself, and Knights attempts to establish a transhuman-inspired civilization.\nAppraisals of the novel have been mostly positive. Additionally, the subject matter has been enthusiastically received by sites focusing on topics such as the singularity, artificial intelligence, and futurist issues. Reviewers have compared protagonist Jethro Knights to the character John Galt, from Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged. Others have compared Istvan's book to Robert Pirsig's philosophical novel Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance or to Robert A. Heinlein's works.\nThe Transhumanist Wager has been widely debated among futurists and has helped popularize transhumanism.\nThe book has also been criticized by some transhumanists as being overtly libertarian, anti-egalitarian, and totalitarian, while agreeing with the aim of life extension and admiring the power of the protagonist. Istvan himself admits that in some ways Jethro arguably goes too far, and that a main purpose of writing the book was to start a discussion in the general public about life extension and transhumanism.\nThe book introduces the philosophy TEF (Teleological Egocentric Functionalism), Istvan's Three Laws of Transhumanism, and the concept of making a Transhumanist Wager. TEF aims to establish a nonreligious and stronger moral system in people and society needed to successfully contend with coming technological change. Istvan states:\n\"TEF is predicated on logic, a simple wager that every human faces:\n\nIf a reasoning human being loves and values life, they will want to live as long as possible\u2014the desire to be immortal. Nevertheless, it's impossible to know if they're going to be immortal once they die. To do nothing doesn't help the odds of attaining immortality\u2014since it seems evident that everyone will die someday and possibly cease to exist. To try to do something scientifically constructive towards ensuring immortality beforehand is the most logical conclusion.\"\nIstvan's Three Laws of Transhumanism are:\nA transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else.\nA transhumanist must strive to achieve omnipotence as expediently as possible\u2014so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First Law.\nA transhumanist must safeguard value in the universe\u2014so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First and Second Laws.\nClarke's three laws\nEnding Aging\nEthics of artificial intelligence\nFriendliness Theory \u2013 a theory which states that, rather than using \"Laws\", intelligent machines should be programmed to be inherently altruistic, and then to use their own best judgement in how to carry out this altruism, thus sidestepping the problem of how to account for a vast number of unforeseeable eventualities.\nMilitary robots which may be designed such that they violate Asimov's First Law.\nNiven's laws\nRoboethics\nThree Laws of Robotics\nTilden's Law of Robotics\n\"Red Ice Radio - Zoltan Istvan - The Transhumanist Wager: In Favor of Eugenics & Technological Dictatorship\". redicecreations.com.\n\"a book review by Gabriel Constans: The Transhumanist Wager\". nyjournalofbooks.com.\n\"Will Artificial Intelligence put my job at risk?\".

Tennyson had been severely stung by the more hostile reviews of the 1832 book, which had found some of his poems silly, affected and obscure.  He meant to reinstate himself in critical esteem, and to this end he very heavily revised the best of his earlier work, often following the reviewers\u2019 detailed criticisms.  This in many cases, such as  \u0152none and The Lady of Shalott, resulted in greatly improved versions.  In the new poems contained in the second volume he also took to heart the general tenor of the advice his critics had given.  By 1840 the work of revision and composition was complete, or virtually so.  The increasing danger of his earlier poems being pirated in their unrevised forms in America impelled him to forestall that threat by finding a publisher, and in March 1842, partly at his friend Edward FitzGerald's insistence, a contract was signed with Edward Moxon.\nA first edition of 800 copies was published by Moxon on 14 May, of which 500 copies had been sold by September.  An edition was published in Boston the same year by the firm of W. D. Ticknor, who sent Tennyson one of the first copyright payments made by any American publisher to a British writer.  Home sales were from the start highly encouraging, and his two-thirds profit agreement with Moxon earned Tennyson more than \u00a3600 during the first four years, alleviating his serious financial difficulties.  As succeeding editions came out Tennyson began to add more poems, such as Come Not When I Am Dead and The Eagle.  The 10th edition, in 1857, was illustrated by Rossetti, Millais, Holman Hunt and others, and by 1868 a 19th edition had appeared.\nTennyson's friends were enthusiastic about the new poems included in the second volume.  Thomas Carlyle found it \"infinitely gratifying to find one true soul more, a great melodious Poet-soul, breathing the vital air along with us.  Such I discover, to my own satisfaction, is this Book of Alfred's.\"  Edward FitzGerald thought it \"such a volume as has not been published since the time of Keats: and which\u2026will never be suffered to die\", but when it came to the old poems in the first volume he deplored the inclusion of \"the Merman, the Mermaid, and those everlasting Eleanores, Isabels, \u2013 which always were, and are, and must be, a nuisance\".  Robert Browning deplored the revisions there, privately writing that \"The alterations are insane.  Whatever is touched is spoiled.\"  The reviewers differed from him on this point; indeed their reaction to the whole book was generally favourable, and not only because several of them were personal friends of Tennyson.  Leigh Hunt, in the Church of England Quarterly Review, praised the book and called Tennyson \"a kind of philosophical Keats\".  James Spedding wanted to see a long poem from him; he also, along with John Sterling and the anonymous reviewer in the Atlas, thought that human sympathy was the strong point of the volume.  On the other hand the Christian Remembrancer believed Tennyson \"had not yet become human enough\", and similarly the Westminster Review, the London University Magazine and Hogg's Weekly Instructor urged him to draw on the sympathies of his own personal experiences.  Many reviewers encouraged him to introduce more contemporary relevance and didacticism into his poems, rather than indulging his Romantic temperament.  There was widespread agreement that the best poems were those dealing with domestic life, even when they were"

In the beginning, a young boy has just regained consciousness and finds he, along with a woman with long blond hair and a tattered blue tunic, are washed up on a beach. The boy encounters a boar as he is walking toward the woman, which tries to attack him and the woman. It charges at the boy while he tries to drag the woman into a hollowed out tree trunk. He puts the woman in first, then tries to fit himself in but is too small. A stag leaps from the forest and stands between him and the boar. The stag and the boar fight. Angrily, the boar retreats. The stag and the boar go away, and soon the woman regains consciousness. The woman declares herself the boy's mother, and that her name is Branwen and his is Emrys. Years later, Emrys finds that he has  magical powers and eventually uses them to defend Branwen against a terrorizing bully who is trying to burn her at the stake. Tragically, he accidentally sets a tree on fire which collapses on a boy whom Emrys tries to save and fails.\nEmrys, in his attempt to save the boy, goes blind from the fire, but learns to see through a visual \"second sight\", after swearing never to use his powers again. After learning to sense well enough to be mobile, Emrys leaves Branwen at the monastery where he had been treated for his burns, and sets out to find his true home.\nEmrys builds a raft and floats all the way to the magical and mythical island of Fincayra, which is somewhere between heaven and earth, also called the \"in between,\" place, with only the bag of herbs his mother gives him and the Galator, which is a pendant whose powers are described as \"vast beyond knowing\".\nThere he meets Rhiannon, a girl who seeks his assistance in stopping the terrible blight which is now beginning to kill the forest she lives in.  Emrys initially refuses, intent on discovering who he is and regaining the lost memories of his childhood, but when the two are attacked by goblins and Rhia tricks them into kidnapping her instead of him because he won't use his powers to save them both, he vows to save her.  Along with a dwarf-sized giant, Shim, Emrys sets out to the Shrouded Castle to rescue her.\nHe learns, from a wise bard named Cairpre, that Branwen really was his mother, but her real name is Elen.  He also learns his father serves the king and was turned evil by the troublesome Rhita Gawr, a spirit who wants to control Fincayra before moving on to Earth.  Cairpre suggests that he visit the dangerous wagerer Domnu, who may be able to help them reach the castle.  Emrys plays her game and wagers the only thing of value he has, the Galator, which he has since learned is the one treasure King Stangmar, under the control of Rhita Gawr, doesn't have, and it is more powerful than all the treasures he does.  Domnu shrinks him and Shim to allow them to fly on the back of Trouble, Emrys' merlin (bird), to the castle, where he realizes that his own father is the king who has made a deal to kill him for the safety of his mother in a deal made with Rhita Gawr.\nWith the help of his friends, Emrys completes a prophecy from ancient times and destroys the castle and the hold that Rhita Gawr has on Fincayra.  Both Trouble and Shim sacrifice themselves, the former by attacking Gawr and pushing him back into the otherworld, and the second by throwing himself into the Cauldron of Death.  But because he went in willingly, Shim destroys the Caldron and grows to his true size as a giant. Stangmar, the king is locked up.\nIn the aftermath, Rhia suggests that if Emrys doesn't feel as if he has his true name, maybe he should go by the name Merlin.  Emrys agrees to try the name out for a while.\nPublishers Weekly said of the novel, \"Readers may find this attempt to create a biography for Merlin less of an organic novel than a showcase for the author's deft recycling of Welsh myth.\"  Kirkus Reviews said that it \"transforms the early years of the mythical wizard's life into a vivid, action-filled fantasy, replete with deep forests, ruined castles, and evil spells: a promising first installment of a projected trilogy.\"\nPublishers Weekly The Lost Years of Merlin\nThe Kirkus Review The Lost Years of Merlin\nInformation about a possible film adaptation"

It was written in 1969 and originally published in the same year in the literary magazine Neva (1969, No. 3, 4, and 5, publication of the Leningrad Division of the Union of Soviet Writers). It appeared in a book form in 1971, with great number of changes as demanded by the state censor; the English translation was released in 1977. The protagonist is a youngster from Earth,  Maxim Kammerer, who gets stranded on an unknown planet named Saraksh.\nAccording to Boris Strugatsky's later reminiscences, the Strugatsky brothers were planning to write a sequel to Inhabited Island. However, following the death of Arkady Strugatsky, the surviving brother felt that he could not bring himself to write the novel. The novel would have been named \"White Ferz\" (\"\u0411\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0440\u0437\u044c\"). Ferz - the Russian term for Queen in chess, which has male gender in Russian. The novel would have followed the story of the infiltration of Maxim Kammerer, now a progressor, into the heart of the Island Empire.\nThe Island Empire would have been shown as consisting of several social \"circles\". While the outer circle represents a fascist militaristic society, the middle circle is a peaceful liberal society, and the inner core is a highly developed harmonic society of intellectuals, similar to the Noon Universe Earth. A special social apparatus directs each citizen of the Empire according to his personality to the circle where he belongs.\nThe book would have shown that this cruel social selection of the Island Empire is the more (or even the only) realistic way for a social utopia to exist, and by contrast would doubt if the Noon Universe's Earth is realistically possible, so much so that it is actually suggested to Maxim by one of the leaders of the Inner Circle (when he finally makes contact with them) that his \"Earth\" is really an imaginary world, some literary invention that is impossible to have existed in the real world (serving as the authors' final judgement upon their own creation).\nTwo other sequels exist, Beetle in the Anthill and The Time Wanderers, but their plots are almost independent from the first book: while they have the common characters, Maxim Kammerer and Rudolf Sikorski, the events of Inhabited Island are only briefly mentioned. The events that authors planned to describe in White Ferz took place at some time between the events of Beetle in the Anthill and The Time Wanderers.\nThere have been three PC games based on the novel released in 2007: adventure game Inhabited Island: Earthling developed by Step Creative Group, strategy Galactic Assault developed by Wargaming and first-person shooter Inhabited Island: Prisoner of Power by Orion Games.\nA two-part Russian movie adaptation, Dark Planet, was released in December 2008 and April 2009.\nThe first English translation, by H.S. Jacobson, is based on the censored version of the novel, as the original version was unavailable to the translator.\nThe second English translation, by Andrew Bromfield, reflects the original version.\n\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439. \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 (\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442) (archived link)\n\"Wargaming\".

The Academy consists of the most elite class in society and plays an influential role in the lives of all living on the island Republic.

Her chosen area of expertise, which she will be questioned over, is on the life of her long-dead hero Adam Forde.

Despite the post-apocalyptic scenario and several action sequences, the book is largely about civilization and its symbols.  Each of the three sections deals with a different symbol.\nThe first is the Postman himself, Gordon Krantz, who takes the uniform solely for warmth after he loses almost everything to bandits. He wanders amongst small communities performing scenes from William Shakespeare plays in return for food and shelter. Originally a drama student at the University of Minnesota, he  traveled west to Oregon in the aftermath of the worldwide chaos that resulted from several EMPs, the destruction of major cities, and the release of bioweapons. Taking shelter in a long-abandoned postal van, he finds a sack of mail and a postal uniform. He wears the uniform and takes the mail  to a nearby community to barter for food and shelter. His initial claims to be a real postman start not because of a deliberate fraud (at least initially) but because people are desperate to believe in him and his claim that he represents the \"Restored United States\".\nLater, in the second section, he encounters a community, Corvallis, Oregon, which is led by Cyclops, who is apparently a sentient artificial intelligence created at Oregon State University which miraculously survived the cataclysm. In reality, however, the machine ceased functioning during a battle, and a group of scientists maintain the pretense of its working to try to keep hope, order, and knowledge alive. The scientists also claim to use Cyclops' advice and predictions to solicit contributions of food from citizens, an approach that Gordon compares to the Delphi Oracle.\nEventually, in the third section, as the Postman joins forces with Cyclops's scientists in a war against an influx of \"hypersurvivalist militia\", the Postman begins to find that the hypersurvivalists are being pressed from Oregon's Rogue River area to the south as well. The hypersurvivalists are more commonly referred to as Holnists, after their founder, Nathan Holn, an author who championed a violent, misogynistic, and militaristic society. Holn was executed sometime before the events in the novel, but in the time following what should have been a brief period of civil disorder, Holn's followers' attacks prevented the United States from recovering from the war and the plagues that followed.\nAs the story comes to a climax, the Postman allies with a tough tribal group made up of descendants of ranchers, loggers and Native Americans from Southwestern Oregon's Umpqua Valley region who are led by a Native American who is a former member of an airborne regiment of the U.S. military. The Umpqua people have developed a warrior culture similar to Native Americans of the Old West and are bitter enemies of the Holnists; they have defeated the Holnists at every turn but until the Postman's arrival, they were not inclined to help the \"weak\" townsfolk of the Willamette Valley against the Holnists. At the end of the novel, the Postman discovers the Holnists have another organized enemy to the South, identified only by the symbol they rally behind: the Bear Flag. The final scenes of the novel give the impression that the groups (symbols) may come together in an effort to revive civilization.\nAnother message of the plot deals with the backstory of the post-apocalyptic world: specifically, that it was not the electronics-destroying EMPs, the destruction of major cities, or the release of various bio-engineered plagues that completely destroyed society, but rather it was the Holnists, who preyed on humanitarian workers and attacked communities during this difficult period.\nDave Langford reviewed The Postman for White Dwarf #83, and stated that \"The story is complicated by Krantz's intersection with another myth in the making, and then by a muddle of battle, murder and enhanced super-guerillas, all a bit of a needless distraction, but never mind. It's nicely written, sometimes moving, and ends as it should. Well worth reading.\"\nBoth of the initial parts were nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novella.   The completed novel won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, both for 1986. It was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel for 1986. \nBrin has suggested that he wrote The Postman as a rebuke to the celebrations of mayhem in the many derivative post-apocalyptic fictions that appeared in the wake of the popular Mad Max movies.\nLangford, Dave (November 1986). \"Critical Mass\"."

Poirot is called in to solve the mystery.\nHercule Poirot - The famed Belgian detective. Hired to investigate the deaths of Cora and her brother Richard.\nMr Entwhistle - The Abernethie family's solicitor. Hires Poirot to assist in investigating Cora's murder and the circumstances surrounding it.\nInspector Morton - The investigating officer for the Berkshire County's police investigation into Cora's murder.\nMrs Cora Lansquenet - The victim of the case. An amateur painter and the youngest sister of Richard Abernethie. One of the heirs to Richard's fortune, before her murder.\nRichard Abernethie - A wealthy widower, recently deceased and cremated before the start of the novel. Lost one brother in World War II, and another brother and two sisters to other causes. His only surviving son Mortimer died six months ago.\nTimothy Abernethie - Only surviving brother of Richard. A grumpy invalid, and one of the heirs to his brother's fortune.\nMaude Abernethie - Timothy's wife, a strong, healthy woman who tends to her husband's needs.\nSusan Banks - Richard's first niece, daughter of his brother Gordon, and one of the heirs to his fortune. She is a woman with a drive for business, and Cora's heir.\nGregory Banks - Susan's husband. A chemist, who inadvertently gave a non-lethal overdose to one of his customers in the past.\nGeorge Crossfield - Richard's nephew, son of his sister Laura. A solicitor for a stock broker's office, and one of the heirs to Richard's fortune.\nRosamund Shane - Richard's second niece, daughter of his sister Geraldine. She is an aspiring actress, and one of the heirs to Richard's fortune.\nMichael Shane - Rosamund's husband; like her, he is an aspiring actor.\nHelen Abernethie - Widow of Richard's brother Leo, and one of the heirs to Richard's fortune.\nMiss Gilchrist - The killer of the case. Cora's paid companion. She owned a tea shop until it was lost in the war.\nMr Goby - Private investigator, hired by Poirot to investigate each family member's background.\nLanscombe - Butler at Enderby Hall\nJanet - Kitchenmaid at Enderby Hall\nMarjorie - Cook at Enderby Hall\nMrs Jacks - Enderby Hall's cleaning lady.\nMrs Jones - Timothy and Maude Abernethie's cleaning lady.\nAlexander Guthrie - An old friend of Cora's, and an expert on artwork.\nMiss Entwhistle - Spinster sister of Mr Entwhistle.\nUnlike in Taken at the Flood, in which there is a strong sense of post-war English society re-forming along the lines of the \"status quo ante\", After the Funeral is deeply pessimistic about the social impact of war. A pier on a postcard has been bombed and not yet rebuilt, which fact is pivotal to the plot. Richard Abernethie is devastated that his only son died abruptly from polio, an epidemic of that time. The son was fit, healthy, about to marry, and then gone. Richard sees no other single heir worthy of succeeding to his estate entire. The Abernethie drive and talent for business are found in his niece Susan, but he cannot consider her as sole heir because she is female. Rather, he reacts to her by being disappointed in her husband. Not finding any one person to take over his fortune and business, he divides the money among family members who seem likely to waste it on gambling and theatrical ventures.\nOne person he valued was his sister-in-law, now widowed by the war. She had a child in a war time affair. She never told Richard of the child, aware of his Victorian views, telling others she has a nephew she helps. She is grateful for his kindness in including her in his will, as she can now raise her son on faraway Cyprus with a proper education. The child is loved, but his mother feels he cannot be accepted in post war England. The last name chosen for Cora's husband, the much disliked painter"

Dead Man's Folly is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie, first published in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in October 1956 and in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 5 November of the same year. The US edition retailed at $2.95 and the UK edition at twelve shillings and sixpence (12/6). It features Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver.\nHercule Poirot, the Belgian private detective\nAriadne Oliver, the celebrated author\nInspector Bland, the investigating officer\nSergeant Frank Cottrell, a policeman in the case\nSir George Stubbs, owner of Nasse House\nHattie, Lady Stubbs, George's wife\nEtienne de Sousa, Lady Stubbs's cousin\nAmanda Brewis, George's secretary\nAmy Folliat, whose family previously owned Nasse House\nMr Wilfred Masterton, member of Parliament\nMrs Connie Masterton, his wife\nCaptain Jim Warburton, political agent for Mr Masterton\nMichael Weyman, an architect\nAlec Legge, an atomic physicist\nSally Legge, his wife\nMarlene Tucker, a Girl Guide\nMarilyn Tucker, Marlene's younger sister\nMr and Mrs Tucker, Marlene and Marilyn's parents\nMerdell, the 92-year-old boatman, father of Mrs Tucker\nHenden, the butler\nA young Italian woman on holiday, a hiker with rucksack\nA young Dutch woman on holiday, a hiker with rucksack\nA young man in a shirt with turtles on it\nAnthony Quinton began his review column in the Times Literary Supplement of 21 December 1956, writing, \"Miss Agatha Christie's new Poirot story comes first in this review because of this author's reputation and not on its own merits, which are disappointingly slight. They consist almost wholly in the appearance yet once more of certain profoundly familiar persons, scenes and devices. Poirot is on hand with his superb English, based, one supposes, on the middle line in the French lessons in the Children's Encyclopaedia, but the little grey cells are rather subdued.\" He set up the basics of the plot and then continued, \"The solution is of the colossal ingenuity we have been conditioned to expect but a number of the necessary red herrings are either unexplained or a little too grossly ad hoc. People are never candid about their vices so there is no need to take seriously the protestations of detective addicts about their concern with the sheer logic of their favourite reading. What should be the real appeal of Dead Man's Folly, however, is not much better than its logic. The scene is really excessively commonplace, there are too many characters and they are very, very flat.\"\nThe anonymous review in The Times of 15 November 1956, was also somewhat damning; \"Dead Man's Folly is not Miss Agatha Christie at her best. The murder and the solution of it are ingenious, but then, with Miss Christie, they always are, and it is pleasant to watch M. Hercule Poirot at work again. The character drawing is flat and facile, however, and the dialogue, always Miss Christie's weak point, disastrous.\"\nMaurice Richardson of The Observer (18 November 1956) pointed out the similarity between the house portrayed in the book and Christie's own and summed up, \"Stunning but not unguessable solution. Nowhere near a vintage Christie but quite a pleasing table-read.\"\nRobert Barnard: \"Highly traditional recipe, but not done with the same conviction as in the thirties. Nobody much is what they seem, and old sins cast long shadows. Mrs Oliver looms large here, as she was frequently to do from now on, both in Poirot books and in others.\"\n\nThe novel was made as a film with Peter Ustinov and Jean Stapleton starring as Poirot and Oliver in a 1986 adaptation set in the present day. It was shot largely on location at West Wycombe Park in Buckinghamshire.\nJohn Moffatt starred as Poirot in the BBC Radio 4 dramatisation broadcast in 2007, with Julia McKenzie as Ariadne Oliver.\nThe novel was adapted with David Suchet as Poirot, as part of the series of Agatha Christie's Poirot. It guest-starred Sean Pertwee (Sir George Stubbs), Stephanie Leonidas (Hattie Stubbs), Sin\u00e9ad Cusack (Amy Folliat), Rebecca Front (Amanda Brewis), Tom Ellis (D.I. Bland), Martin Jarvis (Captain Warburton), Rosalind Ayres (Mrs Warburton), Daniel Weyman (Alec Legge) and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker in her sixth and final appearance as Ariadne Oliver. This was the last episode of the series to be filmed (although not the last to air), with production completed in June 2013. The telefilm was shot mainly at Agatha Christie's home, Greenway Estate, the setting she used, along with its old boathouse on the River Dart, for the novel.\nThe adaptation is"

Yvgenie is a fantasy novel by American science fiction and fantasy author C. J. Cherryh.  It was first published in October 1991 in the United States in a hardcover edition by Ballantine Books under its Del Rey Books imprint. Yvgenie is book three of Cherryh's three-book Russian Stories trilogy set in medieval Russia in forests along the Dnieper river near Kiev in modern-day Ukraine. The novel draws on Slavic folklore and concerns the fate of a girl who has drowned and become a rusalka. It is also an exploration of magic and the development of a young wizard. \nCherryh self-published a revised edition of Yvgenie in e-book format in 2012 at Closed Circle Publications.\nScience fiction and fantasy writer Roland J. Green wrote in a review of Yvgenie in the Chicago Sun-Times that he was impressed with Cherryh's \"characterization and knowledge of folklore\", and described the whole Russian series as her \"most significant work of fantasy\". A reviewer in Kirkus Reviews was less enthusiastic about Yvgenie, saying that the \"most bothersome aspect\" of this story is its \"sourceless, effortless magic\", and did not expect the book to attract too many devotees, except perhaps young readers who may be drawn to Ilyana's predicament.\nIn her book, Cherryh uses the pural \"leshys\", not \"leshies\".\nDay, Mildred Leake (1991). \"Arthurian News and Events\".

The novel was released in Polish on March 10, 2015, and shortly afterward, on March 24 that year, in English (translated by Stanley Bill). It has been described as \"an experiment in reading (and creating) the electronic literature of the future\". It is Dukaj's first novel and was translated to English as of 2017. His homepage described the work as his \"debut in English\", though several of his short stories (The Golden Galley, 1996, The Iron General, 2010, The Apocrypha of Lem, 2011) have been translated prior to this. ...",

The novel presents a post-apocalyptic, cyberpunk vision of Earth where biological life has been wiped out, inhabited by robots and mechs, many of which are humans whose consciousness has been digitized in the wake of an extinction event.\nThe novel is an example of electronic literature, available only in digital formats, and has no traditional paper version. It was designed from the beginning not only to incorporate more traditional elements such as illustrations, but also hypertext, and 3D-printable models of main robotic characters designed by Alex Jaeger, the art director of Transformers films. The novel composition is layered, with the narrative layer, an encyclopedic/hyperlinked footnote layer, and a multimedia layer, including illustrations and a short promotional video by the Oscar-nominated Platige Image studio.\nOne of the novel's central questions is: \"What does it mean to be human?\" Other subjects are \"staples of cyberpunk and related genres, such as the artificial intelligence\". The novel is representative of Dukaj's prose, posing  philosophical questions about the future of man and technology. The other major element of the novel is Dukaj's attempts to introduce the reader to the new style of electronic literature.\nThe novel was nominated for the 2016 Janusz A.

The Jamesons is a novel by American writer Mary E. Wilkins, first published in 1899. It is narrated in the first person by a character named Sophia. The story she tells began six years before and takes place in a small New England town, often referred to as a village, named Linnville. The town is set in the country and is composed of a small community where people are by no means rich, but are able to live comfortably. The lifestyles and traditions of the community are disrupted, in both positive and negative ways, when the Jamesons come to town. The Jamesons are a very wealthy family from New York City who come to Linville for the summer, and eventually buy a permanent summer home there. The mother of the family, Mrs. H. Boardman Jameson, tries to \u201cimprove\u201d the community through readings of formal literature and attempts to change the way the people eat, dress and decorate their homes on both the interior and the exterior. Many people are unhappy about her superior attitude and total disregard of other people's opinions on the changes she attempts to make, but she gains respect at the end of the novel after planning an elaborate Centennial celebration for the town.\nMrs. H. Boardman Jameson is the protagonist of the novel. She is a wealthy woman with weak nerves and has very particular wants and needs. She refuses to eat unhealthy foods, and looks down upon those who do. When she wants to make changes in the town she often assumes permission without asking anyone, and therefore is not very well liked throughout the majority of the novel.\nSophia is the first-person narrator of the story. She is a widow and has a heart condition. She does not know how to react to Mrs. Jameson's actions in the beginning and middle of the novel, but grows to adore her by the end. She also loves Harriet Jameson and supports her relationship with Harry Liscom.\nMrs. Caroline Liscom is the most notable housekeeper and probably the wealthiest woman in Linnville, besides Mrs. Jameson. She takes the Jamesons in as boarders. She has the reputation of being a strong character, and is the head of her family. She has trouble believing things she does not want to be true, and this is seen when she tries to ignore her idea of her son having a clandestine relationship with Harriet.\nHarriet Jameson is a very beautiful girl and is often very embarrassed by her mother. She is sweet and meek, very different from her mother. She is unaffected by her family's money and loves Harry for who he is, despite her mother's disapproval.\nGrandma Cobb is the grandma in the Jameson family. Mrs. Jameson is her daughter. She is very sociable and spends the majority of her time visiting people throughout the day from house to house. She discloses all of the Jameson's business and often disagrees with her daughter's words and behaviors. She always dresses in black silk, which is regarded as one of the nicest things a woman could wear to those in Linnville. She also always carries peppermints and a mysterious novel that she never reads.\nHarry Liscom is a church member and is seen as a handsome, brave young man in the community. He marries Harriett Jameson.\nJonas Martin is an old man who helps Mrs. Jameson plant the poison ivy around all of the houses in town. He receives some criticism for this, but defends himself by reminding people how hard it is to stand up against Mrs. Jameson.\nFlora Clark is a prominent woman in Linnville. She is high-spirited and proud, as well as intelligent and pretty. Her only flaw is her bad temper and she is not afraid of anyone. As a result of her personality, Flora is not fond of Mrs. Jameson and is one of the few people in the novel who stands up to her when she refuses to read the literature that Mrs. Jameson wants her to at a sewing meeting.\nLouisa Field is Sophia's brother's widowed wife. She has a daughter named Alice and is the head of the district school. She is very close to Sophia and always agrees with Sophia's thoughts of Mrs. Jameson.\nAlice is Louisa's daughter and Sophia's young niece.\nCobb Jameson appears to be afraid of everything. We do not know if this is actually the case, or if his big blue eyes, parted mouth, and long curly hair just gives him this look of constant fear.\nMr. H. Boardman Jameson does not have a prominent role in the novel because he is always working in the city while the family summers in Linnville. He used to be very wealthy, but lost his money after his bank failed. He continued to be successful though after he obtained a job from a friend in a custom-house in New York City.\nOne of the major underlying themes of the novel is the wide difference in lifestyles between upper and lower socio-economic classes, and the ideas"

The Return of the Native is Thomas Hardy's sixth published novel. It first appeared in the magazine Belgravia, a publication known for its sensationalism, and was presented in twelve monthly installments from January to December 1878. Because of the novel's controversial themes, Hardy had some difficulty finding a publisher; reviews, however, though somewhat mixed, were generally positive. In the twentieth century, The Return of the Native became one of Hardy's most popular and highly regarded novels.\nIn a footnote towards the end of the novel in some compendium editions, Hardy writes:\nThe writer may state here that the original conception of the story did not design a marriage between Thomasin and Venn. He was to have retained his isolated and weird character to the last \u2026 Thomasin remaining a widow ... But certain circumstances of serial publication led to a change of intent. Readers can therefore choose between the endings, and those with an austere artistic code can assume the more consistent conclusion to be the true one.\nWith its deeply flawed heroine and its (for the time) open acknowledgement of illicit sexual relationships, The Return of the Native raised some eyebrows when it first appeared as a serial in Victorian Britain. Although he intended to structure the novel into five books, thus mirroring the classical tragic format, Hardy submitted to the tastes of the serial-reading public sufficiently to tack on a happy ending for Diggory Venn and Thomasin in a sixth book, Aftercourses. In Hardy's original conception, Venn retains his weird reddleman's character, while Thomasin lives out her days as a widow.\nHardy's choice of themes\u2014sexual politics, thwarted desire, and the conflicting demands of nature and society\u2014makes this a truly modern novel. Underlying these modern themes, however, is a classical sense of tragedy: Hardy scrupulously observes the three unities of time, place, and action and suggests that the struggles of those trying to escape their destinies will only hasten their destruction.  To emphasise this main part he uses as setting an ancient heath steeped in pre-Christian history and supplies a Chorus consisting of Grandfer Cantle, Timothy Fairway, and the rest of the heathfolk. Eustacia, who manipulates fate in hopes of leaving Egdon Heath for a larger existence in Paris, instead becomes an eternal resident when she drowns in Shadwater Weir; Wildeve shares not only Eustacia's dream of escape, but also her fate; and Clym, the would-be educational reformer, survives the Weir but lives on as a lonely, remorseful man.\nSome critics\u2014notably D. H. Lawrence\u2014see the novel as a study of the way communities control their misfits. In Egdon Heath, most people (particularly the women) look askance at the proud, unconventional Eustacia. Mrs. Yeobright considers her too odd and unreliable to be a suitable bride for her son, and Susan Nunsuch, who frankly believes her to be a witch, tries to protect her children from Eustacia's supposedly baleful influence by stabbing her with a stocking pin and later burning her in effigy. Clym at first laughs at such superstitions, but later embraces the majority opinion when he rejects his wife as a murderer and adulteress. In this view, Eustacia dies because she has internalised the community's values to the extent that, unable to escape Egdon without confirming her status as a fallen woman, she chooses suicide. She thereby ends her sorrows while at the same time\u2014by drowning in the weir like any woman instead of floating, witchlike\u2014she proves her essential innocence to the community.\nClement (Clym) Yeobright\u2014A man of about thirty who gives up a business career in Paris to return to his native Egdon Heath to become a \u201cschoolmaster to the poor and ignorant\u201d (Hardy himself gave up a successful career as a London architect and returned to his native Dorchester to become a writer). \"The beauty here visible would in no time be ruthlessly overrun by its parasite, thought.\" Clym is the \"native\" to which the book's title refers.\nEustacia Vye\u2014A raven-haired young beauty, of half-Italian ancestry, who chafes against her life on the heath and longs to escape it to lead the more adventure-filled life of the world.

Under A Monsoon Cloud is a crime novel by H. R. F. Keating. It is the fifteenth book in the Inspector Ghote series.\nInspector Ghote is assigned to Vigatpour hill station, which is due for inspection by Additional Deputy Inspector General \"Tiger\" Kelkar. During the inspection Kelkar, in a fit of temper, throws a heavy inkwell at the inept Sergeant Desai, killing him. Ghote and Kelkar conspire to cover up the killing, but over the brooding course of the novel, it becomes apparent that it is only a matter of time before they are brought to justice.\nIndia experiences seasonal monsoon weather, before which heavy cloud with intense heat and humidity is typical. The story begins immediately before the monsoon breaks and the weather conditions play a part in the death that is key to the plot. Over the period of one year, the time to the next monsoon, the novel builds to a crisis which Keating compares to waiting for a monsoon to break.\nInspector Ganesh Ghote\nA hard working and honest detective in the Crime Branch of Bombay police. Married to Protima Ghote with one son, Ved Ghote.\nProtima Ghote\nInspector Ghote's wife. A native of Calcutta and mother to their child, Ved.\nAdditional Deputy Inspector General \"Tiger\" Kelkar\nFierce, honest and hard working police officer with a reputation for discipline and strong personal drives and a sense of honour. Known to have fiery temper. Arrives at Ghote's hill station to conduct an inspection in chapter two and in a fit of temper flings a brass ink pot at Sergeant Desai, which strikes the sergeant's head and kills him. Kelkar is persuaded to cover up the circumstances of the death. When it seems he will be exposed, Kelkar commits suicide.\nSergeant Desai\nA comically inept and clumsy police sergeant. Previously the comic relief in Inspector Ghote Plays a Joker when assigned to Ghote as an assistant and recommended for a position as security guard at the Ministry for Police Affairs and the Arts. Assigned to the hill station before the start of Under A Monsoon Cloud. Accidentally killed by A.D.I.G. \"Tiger\" Kelkar in a fit of temper at the end of chapter two.\nThe major theme is that of guilt and the concealment of wrongdoing, with the eventual release that exposure of the truth can bring.\nThe character Sergeant Desai appeared in Inspector Ghote Plays a Joker by H.R.F. Keating.\nThe character \"Tiger\" Kelkar appeared in Bats Fly Up for Inspector Ghote by H.R.F. Keating.\nAmazon.com reprints this paragraph from a review from Publishers Weekly:\nA.D.I.G. (Additional Deputy Inspector-General) \"Tiger\" Kelkar has gone to Vigatpore, outside Bombay, to check on Inspector G. V. Ghote's temporary work there. In a fit of righteous temper, Kelkar throws an inkpot at a foolish sergeant, killing him. Ghote, horrified that the much-admired Kelkar's career could end with such an accident, helps dispose of the body. A year later, however, at the start of the next moonsoon, the victim's family gets the case reopened. Kelkar kills himself, and Ghote is the subject of an official inquiry. Keating traces Ghote's anguished vacillation as he weighs the value of the truth against that of his own career. Laden with heavy, monsoon-season atmosphere and graced with a fully satisfying resolution, the latest Ghote adventure shows Keating still the consummate observer of human nature.\n\u2014\u2009Publishers Weekly, Reed Business Information Incorporated, Copyright 1986\nThe website of Tangled Web Books calls the book \"the most impressive book yet about Inspector Ghote...

(US hardcover edition). preceded_by: Small is the New Big. publisher: Penguin Group (USA). release_date: 2007 (USA). The rough idea for The Dip first materialized on Godin's blog. On an entry titled \"The four curves of want and get,\" Godin shows four curves representing patterns of adoption. He ends the post with \"How do you avoid killing something too early, or celebrating too early. And last, how do you know when to kill a dud,\" a theme that would reappear in The Dip. Five months later, Godin posted another entry titled \"Understanding Local Max,\" in which he presented another success curve\u2014this time nearly identical to the one that appears in his book\u2014and analyzed the hypothetical conversation that would occur at four points on the curve. In addition to being the basis behind The Dip, the entry was also included in Small is the new Big, a collection of short pieces from his blog.\nGodin introduces the book with a quote from Vince Lombardi: \"Quitters never win and winners never quit.\" He follows this with \"Bad advice. Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time.\"\nGodin first makes the assertion that \"being the best in the world is seriously underrated,\" although he defines the term 'best' as \"best for them based on what they believe and what they know,\" and 'world' as \"the world they have access to.\" He supports this by illustrating that vanilla ice cream is almost four times as popular as the next-most popular ice cream, further stating that this is seen in Zipf's Law. Godin's central thesis is that in order to be the best in the world, one must quit the wrong stuff and stick with the right stuff. In illustrating this, Godin introduces several curves: 'the dip,' 'the cul-de-sac,' and 'the cliff.' Godin gives examples of the dip, ways to recognize when an apparent dip is really a cul-de-sac, and presents strategies of when to quit, amongst other things.\nThe book is also accompanied with cartoons from Hugh MacLeod, who publishes his cartoons on his blog gapingvoid and is the author of \"How To Be Creative.\"\nIn early March, Godin launched a companion blog to The Dip titled \"The Dip Blog,\" in which he released details about the book and gave illustrative examples. On his subsequent book tour, Godin agreed to go to any place where people had bought 2,500 copies of his book. Godin made stops in 15 cities, totaling 37,500 books. The Dip peaked at #5 on the New York Times Best Seller List and sold 100,000 copies in its first month of release.\nThe book was met with positive reviews, receiving profiles in USA Today, The Miami Herald, National Post, South China Morning Post, Brandweek, and Entrepreneur Magazine. Chris Anderson, author of The Long Tail, and Guy Kawasaki also endorsed the book.\nThe Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick).\nThe Dip: A New Book Coming From Seth Godin on 800-CEO-READ.

The story is about African Americans  working in white households in Jackson, Mississippi, during the early 1960s. A USA Today article called it one of the \"summer sleeper hits.\" An early review in The New York Times notes Stockett's \"affection and intimacy buried beneath even the most seemingly impersonal household connections,\" and says the book is a \"button-pushing, soon to be wildly popular novel.\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said of the book: \"This heartbreaking story is a stunning dbut from a gifted talent.\" Stockett began writing the novel  her first  after the September 11th attacks. ...",

The Help is set in the early 1960s in Jackson, Mississippi, and told primarily from the first-person perspectives of three women: Aibileen Clark, Minny Jackson, and Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan. Aibileen is a maid who takes care of children and cleans. Her own 24-year-old son, Treelore, died from an accident on his job. In the story, she is tending the Leefolt household and caring for their toddler, Mae Mobley. Minny is Aibileen's friend who frequently tells her employers what she thinks of them, resulting in her having been fired from nineteen jobs. Minny's most recent employer was Mrs. Walters, mother of Hilly Holbrook.\nSkeeter is the daughter of a wealthy white family who owns Longleaf, a cotton farm and formerly a plantation, outside Jackson.  Many of the field hands and household help are African Americans. Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from the University of Mississippi and wants to become a writer. Skeeter's mother wants her to get married and thinks her degree is just a pretty piece of paper. Skeeter is curious about the disappearance of Constantine, her maid who brought her up and cared for her. Constantine had written to Skeeter while she was away from home in college saying what a great surprise she had awaiting her when she came home. Skeeter's mother tells her that Constantine quit and went to live with relatives in Chicago. Skeeter does not believe that Constantine would leave her like this; she knows something is wrong and believes that information will eventually come out. Everyone Skeeter asks about the unexpected disappearance of Constantine pretends it never happened and avoids giving her any real answers.\nThe life Constantine led while being the help to the Phelan family leads Skeeter to the realization that her friends' maids are treated very differently from the way the white employees are treated. She decides (with the assistance of a publisher) that she wants to reveal the truth about being a colored maid in Mississippi. Skeeter struggles to communicate with the maids and gain their trust. The dangers of writing a book about African Americans speaking out in the South during the early 1960s hover constantly over the three women.\nEventually, Skeeter wins Aibileen's trust through a friendship which develops while Aibileen helps Skeeter write a household tips column for the local newspaper. Skeeter accepted the job to write the column as a stepping stone to becoming a writer/editor, as was suggested by Elaine Stein, editor at Harper & Row, even though she knows nothing about cleaning or taking care of a household, since that is the exclusive domain of 'the help.' The irony of this is not lost on Skeeter, and she eventually offers to pay Aibileen for the time and expertise she received from her.\nElaine Stein had also suggested to Skeeter that she find a subject to write to which she can be dedicated and about which she is passionate. Skeeter realizes that she wants to expose to the world in the form of a book the deplorable conditions the maids in the South endure in order to barely survive. Unfortunately, such an expos\u00e9 is a dangerous proposition, not just for Skeeter, but for any maids who agree to help her. Aibileen finally agrees to tell her story.  Minny, despite her distrust of whites, eventually agrees as well, and she and Aibileen are unable to convince others to tell their stories.  Skeeter researches several laws governing what blacks still can and cannot do in Mississippi, and her growing opposition to the racial order results in her being shunned by her social circle.\nYule May, Hilly's maid, is arrested for stealing one of Hilly's rings to pay her twin sons' college tuition after Hilly refused to lend the money.  The other maids decide that they are willing to take a chance with their jobs, and their safety, and join the book project.\nThus the thrust of the book is the collaborative project between the white Skeeter and the struggling, exploited \"colored\" help, who together are writing a book of true stories about their experiences as the 'help' to the white women of Jackson. Not all the stories are negative, and some describe beautiful and generous, loving and kind events; while others are cruel and even brutal. The book, entitled \"Help\" is finally published, and the final chapters of \"The Help\" describes the aftermath of the book's success.\nA film adaptation of The Help was released on August 10, 2011. Stockett's childhood friend Tate Taylor wrote and directed the film.\nParts of The Help were shot in Jackson, MS, but the film was primarily shot in and around Greenwood, MS, representing Jackson in 1963.\nAt the 84th Academy Awards, Octavia"

(US hardcover edition). preceded_by: Small is the New Big. publisher: Penguin Group (USA). release_date: 2007 (USA). The rough idea for The Dip first materialized on Godin's blog. On an entry titled \"The four curves of want and get,\" Godin shows four curves representing patterns of adoption. He ends the post with \"How do you avoid killing something too early, or celebrating too early. And last, how do you know when to kill a dud,\" a theme that would reappear in The Dip. Five months later, Godin posted another entry titled \"Understanding Local Max,\" in which he presented another success curve\u2014this time nearly identical to the one that appears in his book\u2014and analyzed the hypothetical conversation that would occur at four points on the curve. In addition to being the basis behind The Dip, the entry was also included in Small is the new Big, a collection of short pieces from his blog.\nGodin introduces the book with a quote from Vince Lombardi: \"Quitters never win and winners never quit.\" He follows this with \"Bad advice. Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time.\"\nGodin first makes the assertion that \"being the best in the world is seriously underrated,\" although he defines the term 'best' as \"best for them based on what they believe and what they know,\" and 'world' as \"the world they have access to.\" He supports this by illustrating that vanilla ice cream is almost four times as popular as the next-most popular ice cream, further stating that this is seen in Zipf's Law. Godin's central thesis is that in order to be the best in the world, one must quit the wrong stuff and stick with the right stuff. In illustrating this, Godin introduces several curves: 'the dip,' 'the cul-de-sac,' and 'the cliff.' Godin gives examples of the dip, ways to recognize when an apparent dip is really a cul-de-sac, and presents strategies of when to quit, amongst other things.\nThe book is also accompanied with cartoons from Hugh MacLeod, who publishes his cartoons on his blog gapingvoid and is the author of \"How To Be Creative.\"\nIn early March, Godin launched a companion blog to The Dip titled \"The Dip Blog,\" in which he released details about the book and gave illustrative examples. On his subsequent book tour, Godin agreed to go to any place where people had bought 2,500 copies of his book. Godin made stops in 15 cities, totaling 37,500 books. The Dip peaked at #5 on the New York Times Best Seller List and sold 100,000 copies in its first month of release.\nThe book was met with positive reviews, receiving profiles in USA Today, The Miami Herald, National Post, South China Morning Post, Brandweek, and Entrepreneur Magazine. Chris Anderson, author of The Long Tail, and Guy Kawasaki also endorsed the book.\nThe Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick).\nThe Dip: A New Book Coming From Seth Godin on 800-CEO-READ.

Monsoon Selection Board: Corporal Dand MacNeill seeks to become an officer, and is examined by an officer selection board in India during the final part of World War II. Despite performing every task badly, often trying to answer cleverly and failing miserably, he is approved and commissioned due to his apparent dogged determination to complete the assault course. He perseveres in his futile attempts to cross a mud filled ditch, although the examining officers advise him to 'call it a day' and climb out. In reality he was unwilling to finish or turn back, as he had lost his trousers while floundering in the mud, and had resolved to stay in the water to avoid embarrassment.\nSilence in the Ranks: Subaltern MacNeill joins an unidentified Highland regiment as a platoon commander, and finds it difficult to conform to the regiment's family atmosphere and to identify with the men he commands. Due to missing a mess meeting he is assigned as Duty Officer and must remain in barracks during Hogmanay (New Year's Eve), while the other officers celebrate by invitation in the Sergeants Mess. To his surprise, he is joined in his quarters by some soldiers of his platoon for drinks, song, and conversation. At the close of the evening, he learns that 'Darkie', of whom he has heard his men talk, is in fact his own affectionate nickname.\nPlay Up, Play Up, and Get Tore In: Dand, in his capacity as Battalion Sports Officer, takes the excellent battalion football team on tour on to various British bases in the Mediterranean ending at an island that is presumably Malta. The team wins every match they play, even against 'The Fleet' (meaning the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet) in a match organised by the over-enthusiastic Governor, who fails to recognise the disparity in resources between one infantry battalion and an entire armed service. Lieutenant Samuels, the opportunistic captain of their transport ship, tries to pass off the soldiers as a scratch team drawn from his crew and win bets on them; he almost gambles away the team's and his ship's paychest on the big match, but the money is saved by an unwitting Private McAuslan.\nWee Wullie: A long-serving, tall, incredibly strong soldier is known only as 'Wee Wullie', when off duty is frequently drunk and violent, and often ends a pass arrested by the military police. The Colonel is strangely tolerant of Wullie, however, managing to keep Wullie's breaches of discipline within the battalion where he can deal with him; and it is learned that during the war Wee Wullie showed great heroism, carrying a wounded German for days across the desert until they were both rescued. He did not receive any accolades for this act of heroism, though, as while in hospital recuperating he got drunk, climbed onto the hospital roof, and sang \"The Ball of Kirriemuir\" in its entirety, after which he was arrested yet again by the redcaps. (In The Light's on at Signpost Fraser revealed that \"Wullie\" was based on a real soldier, whose act of heroism was not a solo march through the desert, but protecting the colonel by defying the Japanese in a POW camp.)\nThe General Danced at Dawn: The Colonel is soon to retire, and the battalion is determined to make a good show at an upcoming inspection before he does. In the event, the inspection goes badly and  'anything that could go wrong, seemed to go wrong,' from upsetting a swill tub, to the kitchen in the enlisted men's mess catching fire, to the junior subaltern passing the port the wrong way at the dining-in. The inspecting General MacCrimmon is unimpressed with the Battalion until he watches a display of the regiment's officers performing Highland dancing.

It is set just before World War I, and chronicles the tragedy of Edward Ashburnham, the soldier to whom the title refers, and his seemingly perfect marriage, along with that of his two American friends. The novel is told using a series of flashbacks in non-chronological order, a literary technique that formed part of Ford's pioneering view of literary impressionism. Ford employs the device of the unreliable narrator to great effect, as the main character gradually reveals a version of events that is quite different from what the introduction leads the reader to believe. ...",

The Good Soldier is narrated by the character John Dowell, half of one of the couples whose dissolving relationships form the subject of the novel. Dowell tells the story of those dissolutions, plus the deaths of three characters and the madness of a fourth, in a rambling, non-chronological fashion. As an unreliable narrator the reader can consider whether they believe Dowell and his description of how the events unfolded including his own role in the \"saddest story ever told\".\nThe novel opens with the famous line: \"This is the saddest story I have ever heard.\" Dowell explains that for nine years he, his wife Florence and their friends Captain Edward Ashburnham (the \"good soldier\" of the book's title) and his wife Leonora, had an ostensibly normal friendship while Edward and Florence sought treatment for their heart ailments at a spa in Nauheim, Germany.\nAs it turns out, nothing in the relationships or in the characters is as it first seems. Florence's heart ailment is a fiction she perpetrated on John to ensure that he did not seek intimacy from her as it would seemingly be too stressful for her heart, and so to keep him out of her bedroom at night in order that she could continue her affair with an American artist named Jimmy. Edward and Leonora have an imbalanced marriage broken by his constant infidelities (both of body and heart) and by Leonora's attempts to control Edward's affairs (both financial and romantic). Dowell is an innocent who is coming to realise how much he has been fooled as Florence and Edward had an affair under his nose for nine years without his knowing until Florence was dead.\nDowell tells the story of Edward and Leonora's relationship which appears normal to others but which is a power struggle that Leonora wins. Dowell narrates several of Edward's affairs and peccadilloes including his possibly innocent attempt to comfort a crying servant on a train, his affair with the married Maisie Maidan, the one character in the book whose heart problem was unquestionably real, and his bizarre tryst in Monte Carlo and Antibes with a kept woman known as La Dolciquita. Edward's philandering ends up costing them a fortune in bribes, blackmail and gifts for his lovers leading Leonora to take control of Edward's financial affairs. She gradually gets him out of debt.\nFlorence's affair with Edward leads her to commit suicide when she realises both that Edward is falling in love with his and Leonora's young ward, Nancy Rufford, and that Dowell has found out about her affair with Jimmy. Florence sees Edward and Nancy in an intimate conversation and rushes back to the resort where she sees John talking to a man she used to know (and who knows of her affair with Jimmy). Assuming that her relationship with Edward and her marriage to John are over, Florence takes prussic acid\u2014which she has carried for years in a vial that John thought held her heart medicine\u2014and dies.\nEdward's last affair is his most scandalous as he becomes infatuated with Nancy. Nancy came to live with the Ashburnhams after leaving a convent where her parents had sent her; her mother was a violent alcoholic and her father (it is later suggested that this man may not be Nancy's biological father) may have abused her. Edward, tearing himself apart because he does not want to spoil Nancy's innocence, arranges to have her sent to India to live with her father, even though this frightens her terribly.  Once Leonora knows that Edward intends to keep his passion for Nancy chaste, only wanting Nancy to continue to love him from afar, she torments him by making this wish impossible. She pretends to offer to divorce him so he can marry Nancy but informs Nancy of his sordid sexual history, destroying Nancy's innocent love for him.  After Nancy's departure, Edward receives a telegram from her  that reads, \"Safe Brindisi. Having a rattling good time. Nancy.\" He asks Dowell to take the telegram to his wife, pulls out his pen knife, says that it's time he had some rest and slits his own throat. When Nancy reaches Aden and sees the obituary in the paper, she becomes catatonic.\nThe novel's last section has Dowell writing from Edward's old estate in England where he takes care of Nancy whom he cannot marry because of her mental illness. Nancy is only capable of repeating two things\u2014a Latin phrase meaning \"I believe in an omnipotent God\" and the word \"shuttlecocks.\" Dowell states that the story is sad because no one got what they wanted. Leonora wanted Edward but lost him and ended in"

Too Many Women is a Nero Wolfe detective novel by Rex Stout, published in 1947 by the Viking Press. The novel was also collected in the omnibus volume All Aces (Viking 1958).\nI told him I was Archie Goodwin, the heart, liver, lungs, and gizzard of the private detective business of Nero Wolfe, Wolfe being merely the brains. He asked sarcastically if I was a genius too, and I told him no indeed, I was comparatively human.\n\u2014\u2009Archie Goodwin converses with the prospective client in Too Many Women, chapter 1\nA malcontent at the Naylor-Kerr corporation charges that one of its employees, thought to have been killed in a hit-and-run accident, was actually murdered. The president of the giant New York firm hires Archie to look for proof one way or another, in the guise of a personnel consultant in the corporation's executive offices \u2014 where 500 beautiful women are employed.\nThe resolution to this Nero Wolfe case is made significantly more difficult by two events that border on impossibility within the Nero Wolfe universe:  1) Saul Panzer loses a tail, and 2) Fritz forgets to give Archie a message.  All of the principal characters in the novel are aghast at how astronomically unlikely each of these events is by itself, never mind both of them occurring in a short period of time.\nInspector Cramer, who always assumes Wolfe is keeping vital information from him, is perhaps most convinced of that in this Nero Wolfe story than in any other, since to take what Wolfe and Archie are telling him at face value, he must believe that these two \"impossible\" events took place (even though they actually did).\nIsaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (October 19, 1947) \u2014 Archie Goodwin, Nero Wolfe's right-hand man, takes an assumed name and enters the employ of the engineering firm of Naylor-Kerr, Inc., in order to investigate the death of a former employee of that firm. In no time at all everybody in the Naylor-Kerr organization knows who Archie is and what he is doing. Naturally that makes it a bit difficult for him to carry on. Another difficulty is that there are so many liars about the place. Nero Wolfe advises Archie to counter-attack by capping their lies with others of his own, which Archie does with excellent results. Most of the women in the case\u2014all very attractive\u2014are employees of Naylor-Kerr, and one of them is even more closely connected with the firm. Nero and Archie win out despite the obstructive tactics of almost everyone concerned. But why does Rex Stout call these books Nero Wolfe novels? Surely Archie Goodwin deserves equal billing with his obese employer.\nJacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime \u2014 Archie is the center of a seraglio of designing creatures, who want to bribe or seduce him as he helps Nero discover who killed (the victim in a firm) that employs 500 women.  Longer than the later tales, this one has a great many lively turns and a good surprise ending.\nDavid Lehman, \"Escape Into New York\", The New York Times (November 25, 2001) \u2014  Of Stout's 72 Nero Wolfe novels, the mystery aficionado Jacques Barzun prefers Too Many Cooks (1938). I vote for Too Many Women (1947). But you can't go wrong with And Be a Villain (1948) and The Silent Speaker (1946) if the place you'd like to escape to is New York in the late 1940s.\nTerry Teachout, About Last Night, \"Forty years with Nero Wolfe\"  (January 12, 2009) \u2014 Rex Stout's witty, fast-moving prose hasn't dated a day, while Wolfe himself is one of the enduringly great eccentrics of popular fiction. I've spent the past four decades reading and re-reading Stout's novels for pleasure, and they have yet to lose their savor  ... It is to revel in such writing that I return time and again to Stout's books, and in particular to The League of Frightened Men, Some Buried Caesar, The Silent Speaker, Too Many Women, Murder by the Book, Before Midnight, Plot It Yourself, Too Many Clients, The Doorbell Rang, and Death of a Doxy, which are for me the best of all the full-length Wolfe novels.\nJ. Kenneth Van Dover, At Wolfe's Door \u2014 Too Many Women is one of the last novels of the series to animate the established conventions without going beyond them (e.g. by introducing a master criminal or by implicating one of the members of the repertory cast). Wolfe's role is subordinate to that of Archie, who engages in a number of entertaining encounters with the women of Naylor-Kerr.\n1947, New York: The Viking Press, October 20, 1947, hardcover\nIn his limited-edition pamphlet, Collecting Mystery Fiction #9, Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe Part I, Otto Penzler describes the first edition of"

It entered the New York Times Best Seller list in October 1942, four weeks later rose to No. 1, and held the position for nearly a year.

Lloyd C. Douglas began his literary career after leaving the ministry at the age of 52.  All of his novels, essays, and short stories relied on his spiritual background for thematic and creative inspiration.  At the height of his popularity, Douglas was receiving on average 100 letters a week from fans.  \nOne of these letters provided the inspiration for The Robe.  Hazel McCann, a department store clerk from Ohio, wrote to Douglas asking what he thought had happened to Christ's garments after the crucifixion. Douglas immediately began working on a novel based on this concept, sending each chapter to McCann as he finished it.  Douglas and McCann finally met in 1941, and it is to her that Douglas has dedicated the book.\nThe book explores the aftermath of the crucifixion of Jesus through the experiences of the Roman tribune, Marcellus Gallio and his Greek slave Demetrius. Prince Gaius, in an effort to rid Rome of Marcellus, banishes Marcellus to the command of the Roman garrison at Minoa, a port city in southern Palestine.  In Jerusalem during Passover, Marcellus ends up carrying out the crucifixion of Jesus but is troubled since he believes Jesus is innocent of any crime.\nMarcellus and some other soldiers throw dice to see who will take Jesus' seamless robe.  Marcellus wins and asks Demetrius to take care of the robe.  \nFollowing the crucifixion, Marcellus takes part in a banquet attended by Pontius Pilate. During the banquet, a drunken centurion insists that Marcellus wear Jesus' robe. Reluctantly wearing the garment, Marcellus apparently suffers a nervous breakdown and returns to Rome.\nSent to Athens to recuperate, Marcellus finally gives in to Demetrius' urging and touches the robe, and his mind is subsequently restored. Marcellus, now believing the robe has some sort of innate power, returns to Judea, follows the path Jesus took, and meets many people whose lives Jesus had affected. Based upon their experiences first Demetrius and then Marcellus becomes a follower of Jesus. \nMarcellus then returns to Rome, where he must report his experiences to the emperor, Tiberius at Villa Jovis on Capri. Marcellus frees Demetrius, who escapes. However, later on, because of his uncompromising stance regarding his Christian faith, both Marcellus and his new wife Diana are executed by the new emperor, Caligula. Marcellus arranges that the robe be given to \"The Big Fisherman\" (Simon Peter).\nDespite its impressive run in publication, The Robe is more familiar today as a 1953 Biblical epic film adaptation that tells the story of a Roman tribune named Marcellus Gallio (Richard Burton), who commands the unit that crucifies Jesus Christ. It was nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, while Burton won a nomination as Best Actor. The film's sequel, known as Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954), stars Victor Mature as the title character who fights in the Roman arena.\nBear, John (1992).

The book generated much discussion upon its release. Some audiences considered it useful and motivational, while others felt that it was outdated, anti-men and antifeminist, or a how-to guide that teaches women to play games that toy with men. Psychology lecturer and therapist Meg-John Barker claims that the emergence of seduction communities happened \"almost as a direct response to this hard-to-get femininity\". Others noted that Fein was an accountant and Schneider a freelance journalist without professional qualification in the subject matter. Fein married and divorced and has recently remarried. Schneider has been married for over 21 years. The authors admitted they were not professionals in an appearance on NBC's The Today Show.\nThey have countered the criticism regarding their credentials by citing the results of actually following The Rules, though there is no body of evidence to support this.\nThe book was followed by The Rules II, The Rules for Marriage, The Rules for Online Dating, and All the Rules. In The Rules II: More Rules to Live and Love By, published in 1997, Fein and Schneider proclaim, \"If he doesn't call, he's not that interested. Period!\" (p.\u00a060). In 2001 the follow-up book The Rules for Marriage: Time-Tested Secrets for Making Your Marriage Work was released in the midst of Fein's legal separation from her husband to whom she had been married for sixteen years. Fein commented on her divorce by saying that she had \"married the right man\" for her at that stage in her life. Her argument was that after having written a best seller and raising two children, she and her husband discovered they were two different people from the young couple that fell in love. Fein married for the second time in 2008; she had followed The Rules to attract her second husband, with the exception that they dated for three years rather than two (as \u201cThe Rules II\u201d advises) before becoming engaged.\nBe a \"Creature Unlike Any Other\"\nDon't Talk to a Man First (and Don't Ask Him to Dance)\nDon't Stare at Men or Talk Too Much\nDon't Meet Him Halfway or Go Dutch on a Date\nDon't Call Him and Rarely Return His Calls\nAlways End Phone Calls First\nDon't Accept a Saturday Night Date after Wednesday\nFill Up Your Time before the Date\nHow to Act on Dates 1, 2, and 3\nHow to Act on Dates 4 through Commitment Time\nAlways End the Date First\nStop Dating Him if He Doesn't Buy You a Romantic Gift for Your Birthday or Valentine's Day\nDon't See Him More than Once or Twice a Week\nNo More than Casual Kissing on the First Date\nDon't Rush into Sex and Other Rules for Intimacy\nDon't Tell Him What to Do\nLet Him Take the Lead\nDon't Expect a Man to Change or Try to Change Him\nDon't Open Up Too Fast\nBe Honest but Mysterious\nAccentuate the Positive and Other Rules for Personal Ads\nDon't Live with a Man (or Leave Your Things in His Apartment)\nDon't Date a Married Man\nSlowly Involve Him in Your Family and Other Rules for Women with Children\nPractice, Practice, Practice!

I am living at the Villa Borghese. There is not a crumb of dirt anywhere, nor a chair misplaced. We are all alone here and we are dead.\n\u2014\u2009First passage excerpt\nMiller wrote the book between 1930 and 1934 during his \"nomadic life\" in Paris. The fictional Villa Borghese was actually 18 Villa Seurat in Paris' 14th arrondissement. As Miller discloses in the text of the book, he first intended to title it \"Crazy Cock\". Miller gave the following explanation of why the book's title was Tropic of Cancer: \"It was because to me cancer symbolizes the disease of civilization, the endpoint of the wrong path, the necessity to change course radically, to start completely over from scratch.\"\nAna\u00efs Nin helped to edit the book. In 1934, Jack Kahane's Obelisk Press published the book with financial backing from Nin, who had borrowed the money from Otto Rank.\nIn the 1961 edition, opposite the novel's title page is a quotation from Ralph Waldo Emerson:\nThese novels will give way, by and by, to diaries or autobiographies\u2014captivating books, if only a man knew how to choose among what he calls his experiences that which is really his experience, and how to record truth truly.\nThe 1961 edition includes an introduction by Karl Shapiro written in 1960 and titled \"The Greatest Living Author\". The first three sentences are:\nI call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is. I do not call him a poet because he has never written a poem; he even dislikes poetry, I think. But everything he has written is a poem in the best as well as in the broadest sense of the word.\nFollowing the introduction is a preface written by Nin in 1934, which begins as follows:\nHere is a book which, if such a thing were possible, might restore our appetite for the fundamental realities. The predominant note will seem one of bitterness, and bitterness there is, to the full. But there is also a wild extravagance, a mad gaiety, a verve, a gusto, at times almost a delirium.\nSet in France (primarily Paris) during the late 1920s and early 1930s, Tropic of Cancer centers on Miller's life as a struggling writer. Late in the novel, Miller explains his artistic approach to writing the book itself, stating:\nUp to the present, my idea of collaborating with myself has been to get off the gold standard of literature. My idea briefly has been to present a resurrection of the emotions, to depict the conduct of a human being in the stratosphere of ideas, that is, in the grip of delirium.\nCombining autobiography and fiction, some chapters follow a narrative of some kind and refer to Miller's actual friends, colleagues, and workplaces; others are written as stream-of-consciousness reflections that are occasionally epiphanic. The novel is written in the first person, as are many of Miller's other novels, and does not have a linear organization, but rather fluctuates frequently between the past and present.\nThe book largely functions as an immersive meditation on the human condition. As a struggling writer, Miller describes his experience living among a community of bohemians in Paris, where he intermittently suffers from hunger, homelessness, squalor, loneliness, and despair over his recent separation from his wife. Describing his perception of Paris during this time, Miller wrote:\nOne can live in Paris\u2014I discovered that!\u2014on just grief and anguish. A bitter nourishment\u2014perhaps the best there is for certain people. At any rate, I had not yet come to the end of my rope. I was only flirting with disaster. ... I understood then why it is that Paris attracts the tortured, the hallucinated, the great maniacs of love. I understood why it is that here, at the very hub of the wheel, one can embrace the most fantastic, the most impossible theories, without finding them in the least strange; it is here that one reads again the books of his youth and the enigmas take on new meanings, one for every white hair. One walks the streets knowing that he is mad, possessed, because it is only too obvious that these cold, indifferent faces are the visages of one's keepers. Here all boundaries fade away and the world reveals itself for the mad slaughterhouse that it is. The treadmill stretches away to infinitude, the hatches are closed down tight, logic runs rampant, with bloody cleaver flashing.\nThere are many passages explicitly describing the narrator's sexual encounters. In 1978, literary scholar Donald Gutierrez argued that the sexual comedy in the book was \"undeniably low... [but with] a stronger visceral appeal than high comedy\". The characters are caricatures, and the male characters \"stumbl[e] through the mazes of their conceptions of woman\".\nMichael Hardin made"

Osfameron Tanamoril (Moril) Clennenson is a travelling musician, who travels with his father, Clennen, his mother, Lenina, and his elder siblings, Dagner and Brid, through Dalemark, a country torn by civil war between the South and the North. They travel around, playing music, taking passengers and messages, and spreading news throughout the country.\nWhen Clennen (the father and main performer) is murdered by the Earl of South Dales, who suspects him of being a spy for the North, Lenina (who is high-born and gave up the chance of being a Lady when she married Clennen) takes her three children and their passenger Kialan, the fugitive son of a Northern earl, back to her home town of Markind in South Dalemark. Within the same day as her husband's death, Lenina is married to her former fianc\u00e9 the Lord of Markind, guided by the belief that this is the only way to counter the bad luck caused by Clennen's murder.\nDagner, Brid, and Moril encounter their father's murderer among the wedding guests in Markind and together with Kialan they flee the town and try to reach the North, while continuing to perform for a living. However, without Clennen and Lenina, they find this difficult to do. The oldest son, Dagner, tries to continue their father's work as a Northern spy, but is arrested for treason against the Earl of South Dales. Brid, Moril, and Kialan are forced to flee, believing that Dagner will be hanged.\nBefore he died, Clennen left his youngest son Moril a magical cwidder (a common musical instrument in Dalemark similar to a lute with some properties of an acoustic guitar). It is rumoured to have been owned by Moril's ancestor and namesake Osfameron, who was both a minstrel and a famous magician, featuring in many of the legends of Dalemark. Throughout their travels from the South to the North, Moril discovers that he has the power to use the magic of his newly inherited instrument.\nAs they travel, they become embroiled in the civil war. As the Southerners are about to attack the North, Moril uses his magical cwidder to make the mountains 'walk' and close Flennpass, the only mountain pass between the North and the South, just as his ancestor, the famed Osfameron, did in so many of the songs Moril's father had sung nearly every day. The walking mountains crush the attacking Southern army, killing the evil Earl of South Dales, Clennen's murderer, and saving the North. However, after the battle, Moril is wracked with guilt, as he caused the deaths of hundreds of men, and mainly because he was angry that his beloved horse, Olob, had been shot.\nIn the end, when all safely reach Hannart, the earldom of Kialan's father, they are joined by Dagner who has been released from jail after the death of the Earl of South Dales and travelled to North Dalemark with another travelling Singer, Hestefan. Moril decides that he should travel with Hestefan and learn how to be a proper Singer. Hestefan accepts, and they leave to continue travelling through Dalemark.\nMoril (full name Osfameron Tanamoril) \u2013 the youngest son of Clennen and Lenina, who inherited his father's magic cwidder and learned to use its powers with dramatic results.\nClennen Mendakersson \u2013 one of the most famous Singers in Dalemark and a composer of many songs with which he travelled through both North and South. In secret, he is the Porter, the notorious Northern spy wanted by the South Earls, using his status as a Singer to allow him to travel freely around the country.\nKialan (Collen or Halain in Southern pronunciation) \u2013 the 14-year-old son of the Earl of Hannart of North Dale, shipwrecked on the coast of Holand in the South and now trying to escape a certain death by hanging in the hands of the Southern earls. He joins Clennen's band as a fugitive travelling to the North.\nDagner (full name Dastgandlen Handagner) \u2013 the eldest son of Clennen and Lenina, a promising composer. After Clennen's murder, he tries to pass sensitive information to Southern freedom-fighters, but is arrested and threatened with execution. He is released when Tholian, the Earl of South Dales, is killed with all his male relatives by the \"walking mountains\" in Fennpass and, as Tholian's second cousin, becomes nominally the heir to the earldom of South Dales.\nBrid (full name Cennoreth Manaliabrid) \u2013 the daughter of Clennen and Lenina, a singer and panhorn player performing with her parents and two brothers from a garishly painted pink cart, travelling from the South to the North.\nLenina Thornsdaughter \u2013 the niece of Earl Tholian of South Dales, wife of Clennen the Singer, and mother of"

Many passages in the Latin version differ from the English version.). name: Leviathan. pub_date: April 1651. \nThe title of Hobbes's treatise alludes to the Leviathan mentioned in the Book of Job. In contrast to the simply informative titles usually given to works of early modern political philosophy, such as John Locke's Two Treatises of Government or Hobbes's own earlier work The Elements of Law, Hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise. Lexicographers in the early modern period believed that the term \"leviathan\" was associated with the Hebrew words lavah, meaning \"to couple, connect, or join\", and  thannin, meaning \"a serpent or dragon\". In the Westminster Assembly's annotations on the Bible, the interpreters believed that the creature was named using these root words \"because by his bignesse he seemes not one single creature, but a coupling of divers together; or because his scales are closed, or straitly compacted together.\" Samuel Mintz suggests that these connotations lend themselves to Hobbes's understanding of political force since both \"Leviathan and Hobbes's sovereign are unities compacted out of separate individuals; they are omnipotent; they cannot be destroyed or divided; they inspire fear in men; they do not make pacts with men; theirs is the dominion of power\" on pain of death.\nAfter lengthy discussion with Thomas Hobbes, the Parisian Abraham Bosse created the etching for the book's famous frontispiece in the g\u00e9ometrique style which Bosse himself had refined. It is similar in organisation to the frontispiece of Hobbes' De Cive (1642), created by Jean Matheus. The frontispiece has two main elements, of which the upper part is by far the more striking.\nIn it, a giant crowned figure is seen emerging from the landscape, clutching a sword and a crosier, beneath a quote from the Book of Job\u2014\"Non est potestas Super Terram quae Comparetur ei. Iob. 41 . 24\" (\"There is no power on earth to be compared to him. Job 41 . 24\")\u2014further linking the figure to the monster of the book. (Due to disagreements over the precise location of the chapters and verses when they were divided in the Late Middle Ages, the verse Hobbes quotes is usually given as Job 41:33 in modern Christian translations into English, Job 41:25 in the Masoretic text, Septuagint, and the Luther Bible; it is Job 41:24 in the Vulgate.) The torso and arms of the figure are composed of over three hundred persons, in the style of Giuseppe Arcimboldo; all are facing away from the viewer, with just the giant's head having visible facial features. (A manuscript of Leviathan created for Charles II in 1651 has notable differences \u2013 a different main head but significantly the body is also composed of many faces, all looking outwards from the body and with a range of expressions.)\nThe lower portion is a triptych, framed in a wooden border. The centre form contains the title on an ornate curtain. The two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure \u2013 earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right. Each side element reflects the equivalent power \u2013 castle to church, crown to mitre, cannon to excommunication, weapons to logic, and the battlefield to the religious courts. The giant holds the symbols of both sides, reflecting the union of secular, and spiritual in the sovereign, but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state.\nHobbes begins his treatise on politics with an account of human nature. He presents an image of man as matter in motion, attempting to show through example how everything about humanity can be explained materialistically, that is, without recourse to an incorporeal, immaterial soul or a faculty for understanding ideas that are external to the human mind.\nLife is but a motion of limbs. For what is the heart, but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings; and the joints, but so many wheels, giving motion to the whole body, such as was intended by the Artificer?\nHobbes proceeds by defining terms clearly and unsentimentally. Good and evil are nothing more than terms used to denote an individual's appetites and desires, while these appetites and desires are nothing more than the tendency to move toward or away from an object. Hope is nothing more than an appetite for a thing combined with an opinion that it can be had. He suggests that the dominant political theology of the time, Scholasticism, thrives on confused definitions of everyday words, such as incorporeal substance, which for Hobbes is a contradiction in terms.\nHobbes describes human psychology without any"

The novel opens like a detective story as the narrator begins,\nSix days ago, a man blew himself up by the side of a road in northern Wisconsin. There were no witnesses, but it appears that he was sitting on the grass next to his parked car when the bomb he was building accidentally went off. According to the forensic reports that have just been published, the man was killed instantly. His body burst into dozens of small pieces, and fragments of his corpse were found as far as fifty feet away from the site of the explosion. \u2014Leviathan \nThrough his own investigations, the narrator attempts to  answer questions as to who the man was who blew himself up, why he was found with a homemade bomb, and what circumstances brought him to a violent end.\n\"Leviathan\" is borrowed from the biblical sea monster that Thomas Hobbes used as a metaphor for the State in his own book of that title. As the \"Phantom of Liberty\", blowing up replicas of the Statue of Liberty around the country \u2013 the novel's protagonist is a Hobbesian hero  whose nemesis is the State; his self-inflicted death, a metaphor for man's doomed struggle.\nAuster is known for placing his fictional characters in real-time contexts with real events as backdrop to his narratives. There are parallels with the \"Unabomber,\" the academic urban terrorist, Theodore Kaczynski who was active for a similar length of time from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s.\nThe story is told by Peter Aaron about the victim, Benjamin Sachs, his best friend whom he first meets as a fellow writer in a Greenwich Village bar in 1975.  Peter decides to try to piece together the story of Ben's other life after agents from the F.B.I. approach him in the course of their investigation. Of their friendship, Peter acknowledges Ben's lost years of suffering and painful inner state, saying \u2014\nIn 15 years, Sachs travelled from one end of himself to the other, and by the time he came to that last place, I doubt he even knew who he was anymore. So much distance had been covered by then, it wouldn't have been possible for him to remember where he had begun.\nThe two first meet as struggling novelists, Peter with the \u201cwheeling\u201d mind and the provocative Ben with his perfect marriage to the beautiful Fanny. Both have a wish to \u201csay something\u201d, to make a difference in the real world.\nPrivately, Ben himself is full of doubts and his marriage is showing cracks, when one night at a drunken party by freakish chance, he tumbles from a fourth-floor fire escape, nearly losing his life. The fall is both actual and metaphorical. For days afterward he refuses to speak and on recovery he is strangely remote. Within a week of turning 41, Ben expresses a desire to end the life he has lived until then. Feeling that his life has been a waste, he declares he wants everything to change, and serving himself with an all-or-nothing ultimatum, decides he must take control or fail. In evincing this change, he leaves Fanny, moves to a cabin in Vermont where he begins to work on a book \u2013 then vanishes.\nHis cabin and its contents are deserted, including his manuscript, titled Leviathan. There is no further contact with Fanny and one final meeting with Peter where he confesses all.\nPeter pieces together Ben's life and relationships with Maria, an artist, and her friend Lillian. A random, violent encounter with Lillian's husband, a Vietnam War veteran named Reed sends Ben in a radically new direction.\nAusterian themes in the novel explore failure, identity, chance, coincidence and the evasive nature of truth. Maria, the character who follows strangers to photograph them is based on Sophie Calle, a French performance artist who recreated her own life by photographing actual people while creating fictions about them. Calle is acknowledged in the novel's introduction. Ben, the novel's central character meets Maria at the point where he begins to recreate his own life. The contrast is that while Calle/Maria parlayed her fictions into a career, Ben creates a life that finishes him.\nStylistically, Auster proves his themes through circuitous multi-layered writing, reporting conflicting personal accounts to inscribe subjective kinds of truth.\nPeter Aaron, novelist and narrator (titled after God's spokesman, the biblical Aaron)\nBenjamin Sachs, war protester, novelist, urban terrorist\nFanny Sachs, Ben's wife\nMaria Turner, photographer\nLillian Stern, ex-sex worker, Maria's best friend\nMaria Dimaggio, Lillian's little daughter\nReed Dimaggio, Lillian's husband\nAgnes Darwin, party guest who causes Ben's accident\nAuster references themes of coincidence and chance that began with the hero of his"

His title is worthless. All he has is a battle-torn Stormwalker and a loyal crew of men.\nMeanwhile, Deryn, a commoner girl, is staying with her brother Jaspert in London. Her father died in a ballooning accident and her mother and aunts want her to grow up as a proper lady. Deryn dreams of joining the British Air Service and to serve on one of the great air beasts. In order to do so, she must pose as a boy (\"Dylan Sharp\"). To pass the starting exam, she goes aloft with a Huxley (a jellyfish-like creature which uses hydrogen to float) to prove her air-worthiness. However, a storm hits while she is aloft, severely tossing Deryn and the Huxley about, and they narrowly survive\u2014she is forced to cut the Huxley loose from its mooring in order to avoid crashing into a nearby building. This results in Deryn and the Huxley being blown out over the North Sea; she is thrilled when she and the Huxley are rescued by the Leviathan, the most famous of the air-beasts, a massive ecosystem comprising many different animals but based largely on a whale. She is inducted into the crew of the Leviathan, and makes friends with the 'Monkey Luddite' Newkirk. The Leviathan's mission is to transport a top British boffin, or scientist, and a secret package to Constantinople. Deryn is surprised to learn the boffin is a woman, Dr. Nora Barlow, and is afraid Barlow will discover her secret.\nIn the air over Europe, the Leviathan comes under attack from German airplanes. The crew fights back and defeats the planes, but not before the great whale's hydrogen bladder is severely punctured. The airship crash-lands in Switzerland on the very glacier where Alek's group is hiding. Alek and Volger witness the crash, but Volger insists they do nothing to interfere, as they will risk giving away their position to the Germans or being captured by the British.\nAlek is unable to stomach letting the crew of the Leviathan suffer out on the ice, and secretly leaves the fortress to bring medicine to the crew of the fallen ship. The first person he finds is an unconscious Deryn, who had fallen from the rigging during the crash. Alek revives her and claims unconvincingly to be a Swiss villager. Deryn is suspicious of him and sounds the alarm, resulting in Alek's capture. Alek continues to insist he is just a bystander trying to help, but the captain refuses to release him and instead leaves him under Deryn's charge. The secret cargo brought by Dr. Barlow is revealed to be eggs of some kind, though most were destroyed in the crash.\nAlek's \"family\" comes to his rescue, and battle almost erupts between the two sides, but  Deryn's quick thinking in bringing Alek to the front and holding him as a hostage brings everyone together to talk under a flag of truce. Realizing their differences are outweighed by their similarities, Alek offers a sizable chunk from their food storage so the ship can replenish its hydrogen supply and take off again. However, as they travel back to the Leviathan, two German zeppelins appear and send out commandos to capture them. Unfortunately, one of the zeppelins escapes, and the Stormwalker is severely damaged by an aerial bomb, making it impossible to stand up and repair.\nThanks to the diplomacy of Dr. Barlow and a bright idea from Alek, the two groups decide to combine their technologies and leave together as one group. Alek also admits his true origins to Deryn/Dylan and Dr. Barlow when he realizes he let a few too many things slip. The Austrians dismantle the Stormwalker and use its engines to replace those lost by the Leviathan. The Austrian engines prove to be much more powerful than its previous ones, propelling them quickly away from danger and Herkules, a deadly Clanker ship.\nIn the aftermath, Dr. Barlow reveals information about a fabricated ship in England that was sold to the Ottoman Empire but then taken back by Winston Churchill despite being paid in full, thus creating tension between the British and the Ottomans. The novel closes with the Leviathan continuing its flight towards Constantinople with Alek watching the mysterious"

The novel opens like a detective story as the narrator begins,\nSix days ago, a man blew himself up by the side of a road in northern Wisconsin. There were no witnesses, but it appears that he was sitting on the grass next to his parked car when the bomb he was building accidentally went off. According to the forensic reports that have just been published, the man was killed instantly. His body burst into dozens of small pieces, and fragments of his corpse were found as far as fifty feet away from the site of the explosion. \u2014Leviathan \nThrough his own investigations, the narrator attempts to  answer questions as to who the man was who blew himself up, why he was found with a homemade bomb, and what circumstances brought him to a violent end.\n\"Leviathan\" is borrowed from the biblical sea monster that Thomas Hobbes used as a metaphor for the State in his own book of that title. As the \"Phantom of Liberty\", blowing up replicas of the Statue of Liberty around the country \u2013 the novel's protagonist is a Hobbesian hero  whose nemesis is the State; his self-inflicted death, a metaphor for man's doomed struggle.\nAuster is known for placing his fictional characters in real-time contexts with real events as backdrop to his narratives. There are parallels with the \"Unabomber,\" the academic urban terrorist, Theodore Kaczynski who was active for a similar length of time from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s.\nThe story is told by Peter Aaron about the victim, Benjamin Sachs, his best friend whom he first meets as a fellow writer in a Greenwich Village bar in 1975.  Peter decides to try to piece together the story of Ben's other life after agents from the F.B.I. approach him in the course of their investigation. Of their friendship, Peter acknowledges Ben's lost years of suffering and painful inner state, saying \u2014\nIn 15 years, Sachs travelled from one end of himself to the other, and by the time he came to that last place, I doubt he even knew who he was anymore. So much distance had been covered by then, it wouldn't have been possible for him to remember where he had begun.\nThe two first meet as struggling novelists, Peter with the \u201cwheeling\u201d mind and the provocative Ben with his perfect marriage to the beautiful Fanny. Both have a wish to \u201csay something\u201d, to make a difference in the real world.\nPrivately, Ben himself is full of doubts and his marriage is showing cracks, when one night at a drunken party by freakish chance, he tumbles from a fourth-floor fire escape, nearly losing his life. The fall is both actual and metaphorical. For days afterward he refuses to speak and on recovery he is strangely remote. Within a week of turning 41, Ben expresses a desire to end the life he has lived until then. Feeling that his life has been a waste, he declares he wants everything to change, and serving himself with an all-or-nothing ultimatum, decides he must take control or fail. In evincing this change, he leaves Fanny, moves to a cabin in Vermont where he begins to work on a book \u2013 then vanishes.\nHis cabin and its contents are deserted, including his manuscript, titled Leviathan. There is no further contact with Fanny and one final meeting with Peter where he confesses all.\nPeter pieces together Ben's life and relationships with Maria, an artist, and her friend Lillian. A random, violent encounter with Lillian's husband, a Vietnam War veteran named Reed sends Ben in a radically new direction.\nAusterian themes in the novel explore failure, identity, chance, coincidence and the evasive nature of truth. Maria, the character who follows strangers to photograph them is based on Sophie Calle, a French performance artist who recreated her own life by photographing actual people while creating fictions about them. Calle is acknowledged in the novel's introduction. Ben, the novel's central character meets Maria at the point where he begins to recreate his own life. The contrast is that while Calle/Maria parlayed her fictions into a career, Ben creates a life that finishes him.\nStylistically, Auster proves his themes through circuitous multi-layered writing, reporting conflicting personal accounts to inscribe subjective kinds of truth.\nPeter Aaron, novelist and narrator (titled after God's spokesman, the biblical Aaron)\nBenjamin Sachs, war protester, novelist, urban terrorist\nFanny Sachs, Ben's wife\nMaria Turner, photographer\nLillian Stern, ex-sex worker, Maria's best friend\nMaria Dimaggio, Lillian's little daughter\nReed Dimaggio, Lillian's husband\nAgnes Darwin, party guest who causes Ben's accident\nAuster references themes of coincidence and chance that began with the hero of his"

They ask Nick if he would like to go to Strangeday Hall, an institution for criminals aged under 18, and befriend inmate Johnny Powers, a gang leader known as \"Public Enemy Number One\" following his recent conviction and 15-year prison sentence for armed robbery.

Believing Penelope to be the Fence, Nick follows Johnny into the Wapping tube station but loses him there. After making his way out onto the street, he is then captured by henchmen of Big Ed, who later tie him to a train track, intending for him to be killed by a train.\nNick is rescued by a man who cuts him free from the tracks just before the train passes. Nick knows that he had seen that man before, but doesn't know where, and the man has quickly disappeared. To prove his loyalty to Johnny, and take revenge on Ed, Nick burns the railway carriage which is their hide-out, by emptying an oil drum and starting a fire. Nick decides that he must go back to Johnny and Tim, but he is still determined to find the Fence, in the hope of being able to barter his freedom. Nick realises that Palis, his French teacher, could have seen Snape and Boyle on the afternoon that he was serving a detention. He heads for Palis's flat in Chelsea but is nearly caught by the police there; they had spotted him in a nearby street. Palis saves him, and Nick explains his mission to him. He stays the night at Palis's flat. Palis drives Nick back to Wapping the following morning and tells him to get in touch if he needs anything. At the hideout, Nick sees a doorbell. Not recalling one, he enters the house through the back and rescues Tim from a bomb rigged to go off if the newly installed bell had been rung.\nTim then explains that Johnny had come back the previous afternoon from wherever he had been to find Nick gone. They hadn't liked his answers, and during the night Johnny dragged Tim out of bed and tied him up before rigging the bomb. Nick and Tim discover that \"Penelope\" is actually a boat, and decide to keep a watch on the Penelope from a nearby derelict house. After seeing men storing objects aboard the Penelope, Nick remembers that Johnny went to \"Penelope\" through Wapping Tube Station. Nick and Tim"

It is the second full-length novel set in the ConSentiency universe established by Herbert in his short stories \u201cA Matter of Traces\u201d and \u201cThe Tactful Saboteur\u201d, and continued in his novel Whipping Star.  It was first published as a four-part serial in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine from May to August, 1977.\n\nJorj X. McKie is the leading saboteur extraordinary in the Bureau of Sabotage (BuSab), an organization found in The Dosadi Experiment as well as two earlier short stories.  He is described as a squat and ugly man of Pacific Islander ancestry, with green eyes and a shock of red hair.  The Gowachin say they feel their bones age in his presence, because when he smiles, he bears a remarkable resemblance to their \"Frog god\", the nearly-divine Lawgiver, Mrreg.\nA born troublemaker, Jorj McKie finds BuSab to be a natural outlet for his tendencies.  But McKie's success as a BuSab agent is really the result of a formidable intelligence and an exquisite sensitivity to the traditions of other races combined with the ability to adapt to any circumstances.  Sent by the agency to Dosadi as their \"best\", he was like an infant in swaddling clothes in comparison to a people honed by fifteen generations of violence.  However, in less than a single week Keila Jedrik appraised him as \"more Dosadi than Dosadi.\"\nDespite his feelings of genuine love for the Caleban Fannie Mae (a love which is fully returned), McKie finds it difficult to form long-term attachments to human women; he had been married no fewer than fifty occasions by the time of the Dosadi affair.  Nevertheless, he finds in Keila Jedrik a companion who becomes far more than a soul mate.\nKeila Jedrik is a human native of Dosadi with short, bristly black hair and icy blue eyes. She introduced a subtle flaw in the computer system governing food distribution, which eliminated her own position as \"Senior Liaitor\" (or Liator) along with the jobs of 49 other human beings. This small, dislodged pebble became an avalanche that led to a full-scale race-war against the Gowachins who lived side-by-side with humans in the planet's one inhabitable city, a crisis she had long prepared for. Jedrik is the culmination of an eight-generation plan to break free of the God Wall enclosing Dosadi.\nWhen the Bureau of Sabotage got wind of the existence of Dosadi and sent saboteur extraordinary Jorj X. McKie to investigate, Jedrik snatched McKie before he could fall into the hands of Dosadi's nominal ruler Broey. The novel chronicles the way they became utterly joined in body, mind, and purpose.\nElector Broey is the ruler of the planet Dosadi, the Gowachin Broey is slow to recognize the race riots between human and Gowachin in the warrens of Chu as the beginning of a world war orchestrated by a mid-level functionary in his organization named Keila Jedrik.\nAfter only a few days, Elector Broey is forced to cut his human allies loose and devote all of his resources defending a narrow corridor through Chu to the Rim. Acknowledging the superior abilities of Jedrik, he nevertheless dispatches suicide bombers to make her inevitable victory as costly as possible. But he is shocked into personally surrendering to Jedrik after the God Wall Caleban makes the sky of Dosadi black in preparation for the destruction of the planet.\nTemporarily allied with Jedrik, Broey seizes the reins of power throughout the ConSentiency universe after the God Wall contract is cancelled.  He is the only judge to survive the courtarena when the Dosadi affair comes to trial.  In the end, however, he only succeeds in providing a single target for the \"ministrations\" of the Bureau of Sabotage under its new leader, Jorj X. McKie.\nC. Ben Ostrander reviewed The Dosadi Experiment in The Space Gamer No. 13. Ostrander commented that \"The wheels-within-wheels plotting is one of the most enjoyable reading experiences any SF fan can have. I recommend this book highly.\"\nThe Dosadi Experiment was nominated for a Locus Award for best science fiction novel in 1978 but lost to Frederik Pohl's novel Gateway.\nOstrander, C.

Francis Sandow is the last surviving human born in the 20th century. An early space colonist, he spent long centuries of space travel in suspended animation. After his last such trip, he woke in the 27th century, where everything had changed.  Desperate for something to hold to, he sought out a mentor, who happened to be a member of a very long-lived and slowly dying alien race, the Pei'ans.  Under this tutelage, Sandow eventually became a telepath and \"worldscaper\". Worldscapers have the ability to create and/or terraform planets. The process of becoming a worldscaper culminates in a mystic rite called \"Naming\" that binds the mortal to one of the gods in the Pei'an pantheon, and it is believed that the worldscaper is actually acting as an avatar for the god. There are only twenty-seven existing worldscapers; Sandow, bound to Shimbo of Darktree, Shrugger of Thunders, is the only non-Pei'an among them. Outworlders are welcome to practice the religion, which is called Strantri. Sandow opines it will be the first major religion to outlive its founders. Unlike most of the Pei'an deities, who tend to be chimeras like Egyptian gods, Shimbo is also unmistakably human, showing that the Pei'ans had visited Earth in the distant past.\nThe rite of Naming was once reserved for the high priests of the Pei'an religion. Sandow is a confirmed agnostic as far as the objective existence of the gods is concerned.  However, whenever he sits for a time in a Strantri shrine, the icon of Shimbo always lights up, and this happens simultaneously in every shrine in the galaxy.\nAt the beginning of the novel, Sandow is one of the most famous men in the Galaxy, wealthy beyond imagination, living a life of seclusion and luxury in worlds he fashions according to his taste.  But he is lured into action by a series of photographs sent to him anonymously, showing him old enemies, old friends, and old lovers\u2014most of whom should be dead, but appearing in the photographs to be alive.\nThe novel is partly a tribute to Ernest Hemingway and some of its meditative sequences are written in a Hemingway-like style.  Through Sandow's narrative, Zelazny presents observations on 20th-century American culture and how it has changed as other planets are created or discovered. An episode in a luxurious city of an earth colony leads to a rant on gratuities, for example.\nEventually Sandow makes his way to Illyria, a world he created as an idyllic paradise, but finds it has been severely damaged. The enemy is a Pei'an rival who as an orthodox member of the faith feels that Sandow's Naming was sacrilege. The ultimate conflict takes place on the Isle of the Dead, at the center of a great lake. It is a replica of Arnold B\u00f6cklin's famous Isle of the Dead painting.\nSandow also appears as a character in To Die in Italbar (1973) and the short story \"Dismal Light\" in the collection Unicorn Variations.\nSandow is jolted from his wealthy, indolent lifestyle by a series of messages, each accompanied by a picture of one of a number of people once important to him, and all dead for many years. Sandow realizes the pictures could be fake, and he has other obligations, one of which is responding to a call for help from a friend, Ruth Laris. In the course of investigating her disappearance, he receives another message that he will find all his friends \"on the Isle of the Dead\".  The message is in Pei'an, addressed to Shimbo (the name of the Pei'an god connected with Sandow) and signed by Belion (Shimbo's traditional enemy in Pei'an mythology).\nSandow soon learns that somebody has been stealing the memory records and tissue samples of people who died on Earth. These things are required of everyone who lives on Earth, so they can be recalled to life should the need arise. The six missing sets are of the people whose photos Sandow received.\nVisiting his Pei'an mentor Marling, who is dying, Sandow learns that his tormentor is Gringrin, another Pei'an who was denied communion with a deity despite passing almost all the tests. Gringrin vowed revenge on the other worldscapers, starting with Sandow. Somehow Gringrin has been able to unite himself with Belion.\nSandow helps his mentor end his life with the glitten root ceremony, in which two telepaths take the hallucinogenic root and have a shared dream, from which only one returns alive. This is also used for duelling between telepaths, which is what Sandow must do when he finds Gringrin.  After the funeral, Sandow sets out for Illyria, the world he made which has the Isle of the Dead.\nLanding by stealth, and armed to the teeth, he sets out to walk the remaining distance to the Isle of the Dead.

Since a new queen has been in charge in the ant nest, the supplies of food given by the ants to the humans are growing increasingly smaller.

Le Jour des fourmis (English: The Day of the Ants) is a 1992 science fiction novel by \nFrench writer Bernard Werber.  It is the second novel of La Saga des Fourmis trilogy (also known as La Trilogie des Fourmis (The Trilogy of the Ants), preceded by Les Fourmis (The Ants, 1991) and followed by La R\u00e9volution des fourmis (The Revolution of the Ants, 1996).\n\nOne of the central themes of the novel is that humans can learn a lot from the civilisation of the ants and vice versa. The people living under the ant nest are acting more and more like ants and thus reach spiritual enlightenment. Meanwhile, some of the ants from the nest discover religion, through humans, and start praising humans (or Fingers, as ants call them) as gods.\nIn one chapter of Edmond Wells' Encyclopaedia of relative and absolute knowledge, the protagonist is asked about the best way to get rid of ants in one's apartment. Wells replies that there is no reason why one should consider himself more of an owner of his own flat than ants. He claims that merely buying something from another human doesn't mean that something is yours now - you have merely more rights to be its owner now than other humans.\nAnts in this novel consider themselves the masters of the Earth and even claim to have been the cause of dinosaurs' extinction. Meanwhile, cockroaches feeding from human trash consider humans their slaves.\nWerber, Bernard. La Saga des Fourmis. Goodreads.\nWerber, Bernard. La Trilogie des Fourmis.

The Mystery of the Blue Train is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the United Kingdom by William Collins & Sons on 29 March 1928 and in the United States by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. The book features her detective Hercule Poirot.\nThe novel features the murder of an American heiress, taking place on Le Train Bleu. The novel introduces the fictional village of St. Mary Mead.\nHercule Poirot\nRufus Van Aldin, the American millionaire, Ruth\u2019s father\nRuth Kettering, Van Aldin\u2019s only daughter, Derek\u2019s wife\nHon.

It also features the first appearance of the minor recurring character, Mr Goby, who would later appear in After the Funeral and Third Girl. The book also features the first appearance of Poirot's valet, George.\nMere months after this novel was published, prolific French novelist Arthur Bern\u00e8de published \"Le myst\u00e8re du train bleu\" in late 1928. A murder mystery adventure featuring Bern\u00e8de's own popular detective, Chantecoq, the story is set in Paris and the plot is completely different. It seems likely, however, that Bern\u00e8de was hoping to benefit from Poirot's popularity.\nThe Times Literary Supplement gave a more positive reaction to the book than Christie herself in its issue of 3 May 1928. After recounting the set-up of the story the reviewer concluded: \"The reader will not be disappointed when the distinguished Belgian on psychological grounds declines to suspect the arrested husband and, by acting on the suggestion of an ugly girl who consistently derides her preposterous mother, builds up inferences almost out of the air, supports them by a masterly array of negative evidence and lands his fish to the surprise of everyone\".\nThe New York Times Book Review of 12 August 1928 said, \"Nominally Poirot has retired, but retirement means no more to him than it does to a prima donna. Let a good murder mystery come within his ken, and he just can't be kept out of it.\"\nBritish crime writer and critic Robert Barnard declared: \"Christie's least favourite story, which she struggled with just before and after the disappearance. The international setting makes for a good varied read, but there is a plethora of sixth-form schoolgirl French and some deleterious influences from the thrillers. There are several fruitier candidates for the title of 'worst Christie'.\"\nOne of the characters in Death on the Nile recognises Poirot because of his involvement in The Mystery of the Blue Train: \"Miss Van Schuyler said: ' I have only just realised who you are, Monsieur Poirot. I may tell you that I have heard of you from my old friend Rufus Van Aldin.\" That line was retained in the television film, even though Death on the Nile was broadcast first.\nThe titular Blue Train appears again in Three Act Tragedy where Poirot boards the train with Sir Charles Cartwright to return to England.\n\nThe novel was televised in 2006 as a special episode of the series Agatha Christie's Poirot, and was"

The narrator is Donald Dodd. In places, including the last few pages, he writes in the present tense. \nDonald Dodd is a lawyer in Brentwood, Connecticut; his friend Ray Sanders, whom he has known since they were at Yale University together, is a partner in a public-relations organization in Madison Avenue. Donald and his wife Isabel, and Ray and his wife Mona who are staying with the Dodds, go to a party in January in New York, given by Harold Ashbridge, a business acquaintance. During the party, he aimlessly goes into a room and sees Ray making love with Ashbridge's wife Patricia (unnoticed by Ray).\nThere is a blizzard on the way back; the car gets stuck in snow about a mile from the Dodds' home Yellow Rock Farm, and they walk the rest of the way. When they get there, Ray is missing. Donald tells the others he will go and look for him; instead, he sits in the barn next to the house and smokes cigarettes, feeling that in doing so he has killed Ray. He wonders whether his attitude to Ray has been envy, admiration or hate. \nLater in the house they get some sleep, putting mattresses in front of the fire. \"The last thing I remember was Mona's hand on the floor, between our two mattresses, and that hand, as I drifted off to sleep, acquired an incredible meaning.\" Snowploughs clear the roads, and police, following up Donald's call, come to question him about Ray. When Donald later goes back to the barn he finds the cigarette butts on the ground are missing: Isabel must have cleared them away, so that the police, checking Donald's story, would not find them. \"She knew. Yet there was no accusation in her blue eyes, no sharpened attitude. Only a slight astonishment and curiosity.\" Later, Ray's body is found.\nAt the funeral, Donald stands beside Mona. Back at his office in Brentwood, he wonders if the others are aware he is a different person. He knows that he and Isabel have become strangers.\nHe goes to New York to deal with Mona's estate. Arriving at her apartment in Sutton Place, Manhattan, they immediately begin a passionate affair. He tells her that at Ashbridges's party he saw Ray and Patricia, and that he didn't look for Ray in the blizzard; she thanks him for being frank, and says she knew about Ray and Patricia.\nBetween visits to New York, where Mona has moved to a smaller apartment, his family life with Isabel and their daughters Mildred and Cecilia continues. Isabel continues to look at him, and he wonders what her eyes are saying. People in Brentwood know he is having an affair. During one visit to New York, Mona tells him she is going to marry John Falk, a television producer. Donald has settled Mona's estate, and he does not visit her again.\nHis hatred of Isabel increases, and he finds it difficult to sleep. Finally he reaches breaking point.\nThe play The Red Barn, by David Hare, is based on the novel. Its first production, directed by Robert Icke, ran from 6 October 2016 to 17 January 2017 at the Lyttelton Theatre, London; it featured Mark Strong as Donald Dodd, Hope Davis as his wife Ingrid and Elizabeth Debicki as Mona Sanders.\nCarter, David.

High school student Bianca Piper, along with her friends Casey Blithe and Jessica Gaither, frequent a teen lounge called the Nest. One January night as Casey and Jessica are dancing, another student named Wesley Rush, who has a reputation as a womanizer, approaches Bianca. He explains that he wants people to see him talking with her, because she is the DUFF, the Designated Ugly Fat Friend, and a connection with her will bring other, more attractive women to him. Disgusted, Bianca finds her friends and leaves. A few nights later, however, Wesley approaches Bianca at the club again after Bianca had a particularly bad day, and Bianca spontaneously kisses Wesley in order to distract herself from her problems.\nBianca's mother Gina, a self-help lecturer, has been disappearing for longer and longer periods of time on her business trips, and one day she sends Bianca's father, Mike, divorce papers. This drives Mike Piper to start drinking again and to demolish the living room, and when Wesley plans to come to Bianca's house to work on an English paper together on the novel The Scarlet Letter, Bianca suggests going to Wesley's house instead so that no one discovers about her parents' divorce. In Wesley's room, Bianca kisses him again and ends up sleeping with him. She insists, however, that she hates him, and he continues to address her as \"Duffy\". Bianca does not tell Casey or Jessica about sleeping with Wesley, or about her parents' divorce.\nAt school, Jessica says that her older brother Jake is coming to visit, and Bianca remembers an ill-fated affair she once had with Jake. The stirring of this memory prompts her to approach Wesley again for distraction, and soon she starts a casual relationship with him, sleeping with him every few days. She tells him about Jake Gaither, but refuses to tell Jessica or Casey anything and begins to avoid them, though she eventually talks about her parents' divorce. On Valentine's Day, Bianca's longtime crush Toby Tucker begins to pay attention to her, and Gina Piper comes to discuss the divorce with Bianca's father. This causes Mike to relapse into alcoholism. One afternoon at school, Wesley gives Bianca a ride after her car fails to start. Bianca meets Wesley's sister Amy and their grandmother, and learns about Wesley's own family troubles. When they go to Bianca's house, a drunken Mike calls Bianca a \"whore\", and Bianca ends up going back to Wesley's house and telling him all about her parents' divorce. After spending the night with Wesley, Bianca calls Casey and asks for a ride home, and on the way Bianca tells Casey about her relationship with Wesley (as well as the DUFF concept). Bianca admits that she has feelings for Wesley, and she wonders if she is in love with him.\nMike Piper stops drinking and starts attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Bianca makes up with Jessica and Casey and avoids Wesley altogether, and Toby Tucker asks Bianca out. Toby and Bianca begin dating, but Wesley takes to following Bianca around, leaving her notes, even sending her flowers. On Toby's suggestion, Bianca reads Wuthering Heights. Unexpectedly, she sees her situation between Wesley and Toby as analogous to Catherine Earnshaw's situation, between Heathcliff and Edgar Linton. Bianca also realizes that her status as a DUFF is illusory and unimportant, since other people sometimes act as the odd one in a group and later become popular or successful. She vows to stop judging people, since she wishes to avoid judgment from others. Finally, Toby takes Bianca on a date to the Nest but notices Wesley staring at her, and Toby reveals that he does not feel chemistry with Bianca and is hoping to reconcile with his ex-girlfriend, Nina. Toby and Bianca part amicably, and Bianca joins Wesley at the Nest, requesting that they begin dating like normal people.\nThe DUFF started as a joke during senior year when Keplinger, who graduated from McLean County High School in 2009, first heard the phrase DUFF, or Designated Ugly Fat Friend. Shortly after Christmas, she walked into the cafeteria one morning. A girl at her table was talking about guys calling her friend \"the DUFF.\" Keplinger did not know what that meant, so when they told her, \"I had these three thoughts\", she said. \"First, 'that's really funny.' Second, 'that's really mean.' Third, 'that's me. I'm the DUFF.\" \"I realized every person thinks they're the DUFF in their group\", she said. Jokingly, she told her friends she would write a book called The DUFF.\nKeplinger also said in a webcast:\n\"I started writing the book, because I thought I was the DUFF of my group of friends. But the more I wrote, and the more I began talking to my"

The novel begins with Magda, the narrator, recounting the recurring dream that haunts her in her old age. As Magda explains, after waking up from this dream, she is forced to face the fact that \"I killed Emerence\". The story that follows is Magda's attempt to explain what she means by this sentence; it is the comprehensive story of her decades-long relationship with her housekeeper Emerence.\nWhen the story begins, Magda has just come into favour with the government and her works are finally allowed to be published again. She realises that she must employ a housekeeper to be able to dedicate herself to writing full-time. A former classmate recommends an older woman named Emerence. Emerence agrees to come work for her on her own terms, but she will not, she informs Magda, just be a person to \"wash the dirty linen\" of whoever is willing to hire her. For several years, Magda and Emerence have a somewhat unconventional relationship. Emerence sets her own wages and her own hours, and even chooses which household chores she will or will not accept. Even though she works in Magda's home, Emerence remains as much an enigma to Magda as she is to the rest of the neighbourhood. The neighbours on their street are bewildered by but still respect this odd elderly woman who is so particular in her habits and guards the closed doors of her house with the utmost secrecy.\nThe relationship between the two women changes dramatically some years after Emerence begins working for Magda, when Magda's husband suddenly becomes seriously ill. Magda, not thinking that Emerence cares about her personal life, takes her husband to the hospital for an operation without telling Emerence. When she returns, Emerence feels furiously betrayed. The two women stay up talking through the night, and get to know each other on a much deeper level than ever before. Although this night does not make them into instant friends, it certainly lays the foundation for the friendship that gradually emerges. Shortly after this episode, Magda and her husband find a starving puppy and take it in, with the intention of nourishing it back to health and then giving it away. Emerence and the dog, however, form a very quick and incredibly close bond, and the dog, whom Emerence names Viola (even though it is a male) adds an extra dimension to the relationship between the two women - Magda, the dog's owner, and Emerence, the dog's master.\nOver the next several years, Magda and Emerence become increasingly close, and start to depend on each other more than either of them could have anticipated. Together, they experience all the drama of the neighbourhood, including the suicide of Pollet, one of Emerence's three close female friends. The two women open up to each other, and Magda learns many details of Emerence's life, including the story of her early life in the same rural region where Magda has family roots. She also learns the story of how Emerence saved the life of the baby Eva Grossman, the daughter of the wealthy Jewish family whose house Emerence cared for before they fled the country. Emerence develops so much trust for Magda that she allows her inside her house, an honour she has bestowed on nobody else in decades, not even her three best friends or her own nephew.\nNear the end of the story, the always robust Emerence falls ill and is unable to continue to perform her duties. She hides away in her house, allowing entry to nobody. Magda, out of genuine concern, intervenes and arranges to forcibly take Emerence to a hospital to recover. Emerence very nearly recovers, but when she finds out that Magda betrayed her secret by letting the whole street into her closely guarded home, Emerence loses her will to live. Emerence dies in the hospital, and Magda is racked with guilt for the rest of her life.\nMagda: The narrator of the novel.

A species of parasitic aliens called \"Souls\" have invaded Earth, deeming the humans too violent to deserve the planet. When a Soul is implanted into a host body, the consciousness of the original owner is erased, leaving their memories and knowledge. Wanderer, a Soul, is placed into the body of Melanie Stryder. However, Melanie's consciousness is still alive and begins to communicate with Wanderer mentally. Wanderer's assigned \"Seeker\" suggests that she could be placed into Melanie to retrieve the memories before disposing of the defective body, but Wanderer makes several attempts to deny her Seeker's wishes. As Wanderer starts to uncover some of Melanie's memories of her younger brother Jamie Stryder and her boyfriend Jared Howe, Melanie gets her to follow a series of landmarks throughout the Arizona desert to find her Uncle Jeb, hoping that Jared and Jamie are with him. By doing so, she would be denying the Seeker Melanie's memories and the humans they would lead her to.\nWhen Jeb comes across Melanie's dying body, he realizes what had happened to her but still leads her to his hideout: a network of caves housing more than thirty people. Most of the other humans wanted her to be killed with the exception of Jared and Jamie, and later on Ian O'Shea, who develops feelings for Wanderer. As days pass and she starts to become a part of the community, many of the community members start to trust her with jobs and eventually gave her a teaching role among the colony. She is also given the name Wanda in replacement of the name Wanderer. After tending to a cancer patient one night, Wanda is attacked by Ian's brother, Kyle. After managing to save both herself and Kyle from drowning, the two are taken into the infirmary. Shortly after recovering, Wanda stumbles across a slew of mutilated bodies that cause her to hide by herself in terror for three days. During her time in isolation, Wanda learns from Jeb that the humans are trying to cut Souls out of their hosts in attempt to restore the consciousness and life of the humans but so far each attempt has resulted in a dead body.\nWhen Jamie is suffering from a fever caused by infection from a leg injury, Wanda realizes that she must recover medicine from the Souls to cure Jamie before it is too late. With the assistance of Jared, the two manage to cure Jamie's ailments in time. Thanks to her efforts, Wanda is entrusted with attending raids for supplies and it is now believed by many that Melanie is still present inside Wanda's mind. Not long after the raiders return to the colony, they learn that the caves have been attacked and Wanda's Seeker has been captured. After coming to a conclusion about the Seeker's life, Wanda decides to tell Doc how to properly remove Souls from human bodies. The Seeker is sent back into space. Wanda devises another plan to remove herself from Melanie's body and let herself die in order to allow Melanie to return to Jared once more. Learning of Wanda's plan, Ian becomes furious and calls a tribunal to stop her plans. Despite his attempts, Wanda manages to get herself to Doc's beforehand. Before going through the procedure though, Wanda declares her love for Ian.\nTo her surprise, Wanda wakes up in a new host whose consciousness has not returned. In her new body, Wanda gains wide acceptance from the humans and is free to be in a relationship with Ian while Melanie goes back with Jared. Over the course of time following the surgery, the colony begins to grow and many of its residents become more prosperous than ever before. The novel ends with their discovery of another group of humans like theirs who have a Soul named Burns in their group.\nWanderer \u2013 Nicknamed Wanda, a parasitic alien Soul who is inserted into Melanie Stryder's body. She received her name because of the number of planets she has lived on, having never settled on one she truly liked. She is later nicknamed \"Wanda\" by Mel's Uncle Jeb. Initially only interested in enjoying her new life, Melanie's love for her brother and boyfriend spills over to Wanda and she finds herself abandoning her kind to seek them out in the desert. She slowly develops sympathy for humans, eventually acknowledging that they have a right to their own lives, and attempting to sacrifice herself so that Melanie can have her life back. Like all Souls, she is naturally altruistic, horrified by violence, and finds it difficult to believably lie (to humans). She hates upsetting people and so suffers"

Riddle of the Seventh Stone is a 2010 novel by Monideepa Sahu. This fantasy novel for children is set in Bangalore, India.  The book was longlisted for the Vodafone Crossword Book Award for 2011.\nRishab: the aged rat who transforms into a shy and awkward boy. He overcomes his shyness to become the hero of the novel by solving the riddle of the seventh stone, finding the treasure and becoming friends with a girl called Geeta whom he saved from an accident.\nShashie: the very old spider who transforms into a bossy and opinionated girl. She plays a pivotal role in the novel.\nVenkat Thatha: the owner of the rare herb store, an absent-minded old man worried about the future of his shop\nAjji: Venkat Thata's wife, deaf but practical\nThe twins Leela and Deepak: orphaned grandchildren of Venkat Thatha. They discover and try to civilize Rishab and Shashie.\nShark: the mysterious scar-faced villain who doubles as a loan shark and a land shark out to snatch the store\nMinor characters like the wise bandicoot and the helpful policeman\nNumerous insects and rats who bravely help Rishab and his friends in their quest\nMonideepa Sahu got the idea of writing this book after meeting the owner of a shop selling rare herbs while doing research for an article for the newspaper Deccan Herald. A big spider weaving a web in a corner of the shop and a rat scurrying about the shop were the inspiration behind the main characters of the book, Rishab and Shashee. In the course of the author's conversations with long-term residents of Old Bangalore, she learnt about local life, and discovered old temples, churches and mosques. Hearing tales of local life, temple chariot festivals, the early morning flower market etc., related by people from diverse communities, inspired the characters and plot of her book. Although the book was written in 2003 it was rejected by a number of publishers for failing to follow established stereotypes, before being selected by Zubaan in 2008 as an anonymous pitch in the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival. The book was formally launched in Bangalore on 9 October 2010.\nA review in The Hindu noted the unusual storyline and praised the book for a realistic portrayal of children and language.  The reviewer praised Rishab as an adorable character and appreciated the book's humorous touches but found the decoding of the riddle weak. The Deccan Herald appreciated the fact that this novel as a fantasy set in India unlike most children's books. They noted the mix of adventure, fantasy, insects, vermin and a little bit of love made the novel fast-paced. The Bangalore Mirror found the description of Bangalore's underworld populated with rodents and roaches and not crooks, as a world full of fantasy and adventure in the labyrinths of drains and nooks of the old Bangalore.\nRanjana Kaul in the Book Review noted the \"unlikely protagonists drawn from the world of vermin and insects, a world which humans generally tend to ignore or treat with disgust and repulsion. The book straddles these two antithetical yet interdependent worlds with ease through its unlikely heroes, the rat Rishabh and the bossy spider Shashee (spelt with a double 'e' for astrological reasons!) who find themselves catapulted unwillingly into the world of humans.\"\nIt has been noted, apart from nuggets of history of Bangalore, the novel also deals with ecological concerns, coexistence and the discovery of self-reliance. However, the author has denied having put in a moral in the book.\nGoing home in the rain, a 2016 book by Monideepa Sahoo\n\"Crossword Book Award Longlist announced\". IBN live, Network 18.

Krasicki's novel is the tale of Nicholas Experience (Miko\u0142aj Do\u015bwiadczy\u0144ski), a Polish nobleman. During sojourns in Warsaw, Paris, and the fictional island of Nipu (based on Japan, known to natives as Nippon), the protagonist gathers numerous experiences that lead him to a rationalist outlook and teach him how to become a good man, and thus a good citizen. This rationalist outlook, often emphasized in Krasicki's writings, constitutes an apologia for the Enlightenment and physiocratism.\nThe Adventures of Nicholas Experience offers a portrayal both of the 18th-century Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and of the broader European culture of the time.\nTitle:\tThe Adventures of Mr. Nicholas Wisdom\nAuthor\tIgnacy Krasicki\nEditor:\tNorthwestern University Press, 1992\nISBN\u00a00810110148, 9780810110144\n148 pages\n\n\"Ignacy Krasicki\".

It is the first volume of a series known to Poles as The Trilogy, followed by The Deluge (Potop, 1886) and Fire in the Steppe (originally published under the Polish title Pan Woodyjowski, which translates to Lord Wolodyjowski). The novel has been adapted as a film several times, most recently in 1999.

Despite some deviations, the book's historical framework is genuine and the fictional story is woven into real events. Many characters are historical figures, including Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki and Bohdan Khmelnytsky (Polish: Bohdan Chmielnicki). Sienkiewicz researched memoirs and chronicles of the Polish nobility, or szlachta, for details on life in 17th-century Poland. The book was written, according to the author, \"to lift up the heart\" of the Polish nation in the unhappy period following the failed January Uprising during the era of the partitions of Poland. Thus it often favors epic plots and heroic scenes over historical accuracy. Nonetheless, Sienkiewicz's vivid language made it one of the most popular books about that particular place and era.\nJan Skrzetuski (Yan Skshetuski), lieutenant of the armoured regiment of Prince Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki (Yeremi Vishnyevetski), gives assistance to Bohdan Zenobi Chmielnicki (first posing as Abdank) as his party are returning from a mission to the Khan through the Wilderness. At Czyhryn (Pol. Czehry\u0144) the next day, Skrzetuski learns that Chmielnicki was escaping to the Sich. In a tavern he throws Czapli\u0144ski (Chaplinski), a voluble under\u2013starosta (and Chmielnicki's deadly enemy), out through the door. It is here that he also becomes acquainted with Zag\u0142oba and the Lithuanian Podbipi\u0119ta (Podbipienta), who wishes to join the service of Prince Jeremi in order to fulfil his family vow of cutting off the heads of three infidels, all at the same time with one blow.\nOn their way to Lubni, the party comes to the assistance of two women, one of whom is Helena Kurcewicz (Kurtsevich), returning to her aunt's home that really belongs to her. Jan's party are invited back to Rozlogi where Jan meets Bohun, a Cossack, adopted as a sixth son by the old princess (Helena's aunt). Bohun wants to pick a quarrel but is sent away and Jan is able to declare his love for Helena. Skrzetuski realizes the girl is being mistreated and denied her rights so gets the princess to promise Helena to him instead of Bohun or he will have Prince Jeremi help her recover home. The lieutenant finally arrives at Lubni and tells his comrades about his mission to the Crimea. Prince Jeremi returns and entertainments are laid on. To wile away the time, Skrzetuski fences with his friend, Micha\u0142 Wo\u0142odyjowski (Volodyovski), and receives a response to his letter sent to Helena via Rz\u0119dzian (Jendzian), his assistant.\nRevolution is now afoot. The prince decides to send an envoy, in a group led by Pan (Sir) Bychowiec (Bykhovets), to the Sich to find out about Chmielnicki. Jan persuades him to let him go in his place as he wants to see Helena and receives permission from the prince. He meets Helena once more at Rozlogi and then sets out for Czyhryn. Here, he meets Za\u0107wilichowski (Zatsvilikhovski), an old colonel, who says he expects revolt in the Ukraine. He also re-encounters Zag\u0142oba who tells him that he has befriended Bohun. Further on his travels he decides to send Rz\u0119dzian with a message to Helena to flee the impending hordes. His party encounters some Cossacks and Tartars and a fight breaks out in which Jan's soldiers are slaughtered and he severely wounded. The alliance between the Cossacks and Tartars had been brokered by Chmielnicki, who understood that Cossacks, while having an excellent infantry, could not hope to match the Polish cavalry, the best in Europe. By combining Cossack infantry with Tartar cavalry, the uprising had balanced military force and a chance to beat the Polish army.\nThe messages to the friends in the court are discovered and two, Barabasz (Barabash) and Tatarczuk (Tatarchuk), are murdered by the Brotherhood of Cossacks. Tuhaj-bej (Tugay Bey), the Tartar leader, is given Jan as a ransom captive and news arrives that the Great Hetman, Miko\u0142aj Potocki (Pototski), has sent his son Stefan (Stephen) with his army against the Brotherhood, so Chmielnicki is chosen as their leader. The Zaporojians and Tartars march out of the Sitch to meet the Poles marching from Czyhryn. Chmielnicki avoids besieging Kudak. Krzeszowski (Krechovski), a Cossack, is sent to support Potocki but is won over by talks with Chmielnicki and massacres the German mercenaries who refuse to support his betrayal. At \u017b\u00f3\u0142te Wody (Zhovti Vody) the Polish hussars become bogged down in the soft mud and cannot attack on the second day of the battle, so Chmielnicki wins it and another at Kruta Ba\u0142ka (Krutaya Balka).\nChmielnicki frees Jan to parley with the Prince. Skrzetuski passes through a devastated landscape to Czyhryn and then to Rozlogi, where he discovers that Helena has disappeared. He mistakenly"

The Horn of Mortal Danger is a 1980 novel by British musician Lawrence Leonard.  It relates the adventures of a brother and sister as they discover a secret civilisation buried beneath the streets of London.  It is a 'classical' children's fantasy.\nIt is worth noting that, seemingly in imitation of The Lord of the Rings (1937 and 1949), Leonard includes appendices relating the aftermath of the story underground, in which the Railwaymen and Canal Folk discuss the joint threats of the children and the rats, and giving a short history of the North London System (and suggesting that similar societies exist beneath many major cities, at least in England).  It also includes two short \"Interludes\", set aboveground, concerning the search for the missing children.\nLeonard's secondary world is unusual in that it overlaps with the primary one and is separated from it, it seems, through nothing stronger than blind luck.  Uniquely among such fantasies, Leonard never employs magic, and indeed seems at pains to explain how his underground System works.  There are no women seen underground, nor any apparent means to produce food to support the Undergrounders, but rather than hoping his readers will not notice this (as the children do), he explains very concisely the why and how of this in a throwaway manner near the beginning.  \nThe technology of railways and canals is borrowed from observation of the Aboveground world, but the System is conservative and usually does not adopt new things very quickly.  They have no electricity, though the Railway is reportedly looking into the matter.  The children finally make their escape through an Observation Shaft, similar to the one they entered through, which leads into the Post Office Railway, and is used to study the operation of electric trains.\nIn the story, the System had existed for centuries before the Tube, and it is mentioned in the second Appendix that the beginning of construction of the Tube caused the Undergrounders considerable alarm, although tempered by pride that the Abovegrounders were (seemingly) imitating them for a change.\nThe key clue to the location of the System is the River Fleet, diverted underground in the eighteenth century.  It serves as the spine of the canal network and the setting for one of the most dramatic scenes in the book, as both the train (with Widgie on board) and the boat (with Jen) race against time to reach and pass a bridge over it as the river becomes swollen and flooded.  \nSeveral locations (King's Cross, Paddington, Camden Lock) are named after real-world locations, and it appears from the map in the book that these are intended to be very near their real-world locations: the System incorporates the area roughly bounded on the surface by Muswell Hill to the north, Tottenham and Islington to the east, Paddington and Oxford Street to the south and Finchley Road to the west.  The southern part of this area includes the River Fleet, which drains southwards into the Thames.\nLeonard, Lawrence (1980). The Horn of Mortal Danger. Cox and Wyman Ltd. ISBN\u00a00-7445-0847-9."

What is relentless is our education, which, for good or ill, gives us no rest. That is why poverty is a great educator. Having no boundaries and refusing to be ignored, it mostly teaches hopelessness. But not always. Politics is also a great educator. Mostly, it teaches, I am afraid, cynicism. But not always. Television is a great educator as well. Mostly it teaches consumerism. But not always.\" (pg. ix.)\n Postman believes that schools' primary social function is to create a common culture among citizens through the communication of unifying purpose-giving narratives rather than to simply initiate children into the economy.  \n\u201cThe idea of public education depends absolutely on the existence of shared narratives and the exclusion of narratives that lead to alienation and divisiveness.  What makes public schools public is not so much that the schools have common goals but that the students have common gods.  The reason for this is that public education does not serve a public.  It creates a public.\u201d (pg. 17)\nFurthermore, he feels American education has drifted away from its founding narratives of democracy and Individual rights, replaced by the narratives of economic utility and the belief in technology as the measure of humanity's progress.  Postman believes that the school system's current narratives at best, fail to sufficiently inspire and, all too often, fail to communicate anything at all.  Chief among the failing gods is Economic Utility, the view of school's highest purpose as preparation for the workplace.  \n\"The preparation for making a living... is well served by any decent education.\" (pg. 32, 33)  \u201cHere it is necessary to say that no reasonable argument can be made against educating the young to be consumers or to think about the kinds of employment that might interest them. But when these are elevated to the status of a metaphysical imperative, we are being told that we have reached the end of our wits\u2014even worse, the limit of our wisdom.\u201d (pg. 35,36)\nIn the second part of the book, Postman proposes 5 narratives as possible alternatives to the current ones: \n\"Spaceship Earth\" (the notion of humans as stewards of the planet)\n\"The Fallen Angel\" (a view of history and the advancement of knowledge as a series of errors and corrections)\n\"The American Experiment\" (the story of America as a great experiment and as a center of continuous argument)\n\"The Laws of Diversity\" (the view that difference contributes to increased vitality and excellence, and, ultimately, to a sense of unity)\n\"The Word Weavers/The World Makers\" (the understanding that the world is created through language \u2014 through definitions, questions, and metaphors)\nPostman, Neil (1996).

The story is about a small rainbowfish with shiny, multi-coloured scales. He has blue, green, purple, and pink scales. Interspersed with these colorful scales are shiny, holographic scales which are his favorites. The other fish from his gang also have scales, but only scales matching to their real colors. However, they wish that they had shiny silver scales just like that little newbie  Rainbow Fish. One day, a small blue fish (wishing he could have shiny silver scales) asks the Rainbow Fish if he could have one of his shiny silver scales. The Rainbow Fish refuses in a very rude manner. The small blue fish tells all the other fish that The Rainbow Fish was being rude, and as a result, the other fish do not want to play with him any more.\nHis only remaining friend, the starfish, tells him to go visit the wise octopus for advice. When he goes to the cave where the wise octopus lives, he sees the octopus, who says that she has been waiting for him. She explains that the waves have told her his story. Then, she gives The Rainbow Fish her advice: He must share his scales with the other fish. She continues that he might no longer be the most beautiful fish after that, but he will discover how to be happy. The Rainbow Fish says that he cannot share his favorite scales, and the wise octopus disappears in a cloud of ink.\nWhen he encounters the little blue fish for a second time, The Rainbow Fish shares one of his precious silver scales and sees the little fish's joy. With that one shiny scale gone, he immediately feels much better. Very soon, the Rainbow Fish is surrounded by the other fish requesting scales and he shares one of his shiny silver scales with each of them. Soon, everyone in the ocean has one shiny scale, including The Rainbow Fish. The Rainbow Fish is finally happy even though he only had one shiny scale left.\nA Publishers Weekly reviewer called the book a \"cautionary tale about selfishness and vanity\".\nThere are five other sequels in the Rainbow Fish book series:\nRainbow Fish to the Rescue: About the acceptance and integration of foreigners.\nRainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale: About arguments and how to settle them.\nRainbow Fish and the Sea Monster's Cave: About irrational and rational fears.\nRainbow Fish Finds his Way: With the help of his new friends, Rainbow Fish finds his way back home.\nRainbow Fish Discovers the Deep Sea: About modesty and happiness.\nOn March 25, 1997, an animated adaptation of the story book was released on VHS and DVD (known as The Rainbow Fish and Dazzle the Dinosaur). The home video releases also contain the film Dazzle the Dinosaur which is based on another book written by Pfister and published in 1994. The animated short film features a song called \"Giving Makes You Special\". In Dazzle the Dinosaur, the imaginary dinosaur named Dazzle is an egg (separated from another family and is at first an orphan). Although it is not specified what kind of dinosaur he is, he is possibly an Ouranosaurus (relative of Iguanodon; or in other words a dinosaur from the Iguanodontidae family). Then he adopts a young female Maiasaura from a Maiasaura family and herd. Her name is Maia the Maiasaura. In this story, they try to get the no-good Dragonsaurus (which terrified the Maiasauruses) to give them back their old home (which had once been in a cave). The duo (Dazzle and Maia) see a Apatosaurus. Then they tell him the truth about their old home (their cave) which the Dragonsaurus had moved in to. When the Quetzalcoatlus takes Dazzle and Maia to the cave (which the Dragonsaurus had moved in). But he warns them he and his flock leave at sunset. Because he is not staying when the Dragonsaurus comes around (saying to them, \"I am never again coming back to that cave once the Dragonsaurus is awake!\"). The Dragonsaurus does give it back in the end, and Dazzle, Maia, and all the other Maiasauruses are able to return to their old home. The dinosaurs in this story are Apatosaurus, Stegosaurus, Quetzalcoatlus, Deinonychus, Tyrannosaurus rex, Ouranosaurus (that being Dazzle), and Dragonsaurus.\nThe Rainbow Fish was adapted into a children's animated television series in 1999. However, the television series does not follow the plot of the book; rather it takes the character and the setting and creates a new story with them. Some characters were added and others embellished for the purposes of the show. In the series, the place where the fish live is called Neptune Bay (after Neptune, god of the sea). The fish attend school, which is aptly named \"The School of Fish\". There is a shipwreck called \"Shipwreck Park\" in the series that resembles the wreck of the RMS Titanic. It was produced by Decode"

The first part of the novel is set in Devon, where Dr Conybeare, a progressive-minded physician, resides in the parish of Rev. Robert Herrick. The widowed doctor lives alone with the youngest of his four children, his fifteen-year-old daughter Julian. Conybeare himself is an atheist, but the studious Julian attends church with her friend Meg Yarde, granddaughter of the local squire. Meg's brother Giles is a student at the University of Cambridge, along with Julian's brother Kit. Dr Conybeare deplores the lack of educational opportunities for women, and has Julian privately tutored in the classics by Herrick, who also instils in her a love for literature, particularly poetry. When an elderly local woman is accused of witchcraft, Conybeare and his daughter hide her in their home, but she is discovered and sentenced to be burned at the stake. The doctor administers a fast-acting poison to save her from suffering, and thus incurs the anger of the local population. \nDeciding to take Julian away from the hostile atmosphere of the village, Dr Conybeare arranges a visit to his son in Cambridge, and a party is made up, consisting of the Conybeares, Herrick and Meg Yarde. The second part of the novel takes place mainly in Cambridge, where Julian is thrilled to find herself in the company of many prominent poets and philosophers, and begins attending classes given by Henry More to selected young ladies. She is largely unaware of the political upheavals that threaten to escalate into war, but is concerned when her brother Kit converts to Catholicism without their father's knowledge. She also falls in love with Kit's urbane tutor, John Cleveland, even though Cleveland has no sympathy with the idea of female education and belittles Julian's interest in the classics and philosophy. Banned by his college fellowship from marrying, he has no fear of permanent entanglement, but does not seek to draw Julian into a sexual relationship.  Their friendship is resented by Giles Yarde, who is himself in love with Julian.\nAfter a few weeks, Squire Yarde summons Herrick and Meg back to Devon, but the Conybeares stay on. When the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Dr John Cosin, is threatened with the loss of his position because of his supposed Catholic leanings (early 1641), the authorities begin to crack down on recusants, and three Catholic priests are arrested during the celebration of Mass. Several students found attending the service, including Kit, are reported to their colleges. Because of his burgeoning romance with Julian, Cleveland agrees to keep quiet about Kit's involvement, on condition that he abandon his Catholicism.  Kit refuses to do so, and goes to London. His father pursues him there, leaving Cleveland to take advantage of his time alone with Julian. Kit is found in the entourage of the prominent Catholic courtier, Sir Kenelm Digby.  Conybeare decides to leave Kit to make his own way in the world, and returns to Cambridge. Cleveland, realising that his affair with Julian must now come to an end, breaks off their relationship.\nDr Conybeare's elder son, Francis, arrives with news that Kit is back in the country and the doctor goes once more to London in the hope of persuading Kit to return to Cambridge, leaving Julian in the care of Francis. Very soon, Francis hears rumours of Julian's involvement with Cleveland, whom he hates as a result of their previous acquaintance. He confronts Cleveland and a brawl begins.  When Julian attempts to intervene, Francis pushes her out of the way and she hits her head on a corner of the table and is killed outright.

Storm Thief is a 2006 dystopian science-fiction novel written by Chris Wooding and published by Scholastic Books. It also has elements of the Gothic, tech-punk, and alternate history genres. It is set on a futuristic island-city known as Orokos, which is plagued by deadly \"probability storms.\" It features a group of outcasts on the run, a mysterious artifact, a golem with a shadowed past, an underground resistance movement, a corrupt government, the downfall of two civilizations, and a seabird. The novel displays a number of literary themes, including fate, free will, and redemption.  It received recognition as a 2007 Best Book for Young Adults from the American Library Association.\nRail is willful and highly protective of Moa. Rail was left without functioning lungs after one particularly bad probability storm, and therefore must constantly use a respirator  to him by the Thief master Anya-Jacanca, in return for his services as a thief. Rail believes his duty is to protect unassuming, naive Moa from the roughness of the ghetto, a job he carries out dutifully. He is highly distrustful of Vago, but allows him to stay with them because he is so important to Moa. At the end of the book, it becomes apparent that Rail has romantic feelings for Moa, and vice versa.\nMoa is Rail's best friend and helps him steal things for Anya-Jacana. She is sickly and weak, and depends heavily on Rail for her own survival. She strikes up a friendship with the golem, Vago. Moa is convinced that there is more to the world beyond Orokos, though Rail does not and even scorns her convictions. The more feeling of the two, Moa tends to follow her heart more than her head, a tendency that gets her and her friends into trouble more than once. She loves Rail very much, although she's not always sure in which way.\nVago is a golem, half man half machine.  He was created by the Protectorate Chief of Police, Lysander Bane, to be a super soldier against Revenants. He was created to be a prototype and was a murderer named Tukor Kep before he lost his memories in the surgery. As he is about to finish his programming a probability storm takes him from the laboratory and places him in the home of the toy maker, Cretch. Cretch abuses Vago because Vago reminds him of a granddaughter he lost to the same storm. Vago finally has a moment where he snaps and attacks Cretch during a beating. He is later found by Rail and Moa. He wants to stay with Moa and protect her but doesn't like to be around Rail. He is eventually caught by the Secret police who program him to hate ghetto people. Vago almost murders Moa but his former compassion for her overrides his new programming. At the end of the book, Vago is willing to sacrifice himself to allow Rail and Moa escape from Orokos.\nChris Wooding, Storm Thief, 2006, Scholastic\nAmerican Library Association (2007). \"2007 Best Books for Young Adults\".

In The Reality Dysfunction, the presence of an energy-based alien lifeform during the death of a human on the colony world of Lalonde somehow 'jammed open' the interface between this universe and 'the beyond', an energistic vacuum where the souls of dead humans (and other races, although they inhabit different areas within that realm) have become trapped after death. They are able to cross back over into this universe and possess the living, gaining tremendous strength, agility and the ability to create and alter matter. They overrun the planet Lalonde in a matter of weeks and spread beyond to many other worlds and asteroid settlements. A failed attempt to conquer the planet Atlantis alerts the Edenists to the threat.\nIn The Neutronium Alchemist, the Confederation learns of the extent of the danger and imposes a complete shut-down of all interstellar flight to quarantine the possessed on the few planets they have secured a foothold on. However, quarantine-busting flights soon spread the possessed further. The deployment of military forces against the possessed is complicated by the fact that killing the possessor also kills the possessed victim. This depressing fact, creating the greatest hostage situation in human history, threatens to undermine morale. Eventually, the Kulu Kingdom joins forces with their ideological opponents, the Edenists, to retake the peninsula of Mortonridge on their colony world of Ombey from the possessed to provide the Confederation with proof that the possessed can be beaten. Elsewhere, the most infamous 'returnee' of the possessed, Al Capone, uses his organisational skills to conquer the planet New California and turn it into the hub of an expanding empire, 'The Organisation', with the Confederation Navy hard-pressed to deal with checking its advance whilst maintaining the quarantine.\nAt the conclusion of The Neutronium Alchemist, the personnel of Tranquillity learned that over a thousand years ago a Tyrathca arkship encountered a space-borne entity known as the 'Sleeping God' which exhibited enormous powers which may be of use against the possessed. Before this information could be passed onto anyone, the habitat came under concerted attack by the Organisation. When Captain Calvert and the crew of the Lady MacBeth arrived back at Tranquillity, they found the habitat missing, presumed possessed and taken out of the universe.\nJay Hilton, one of the surviving children from Lalonde, is awoken when Tranquillity falls under attack by the Organisation and its hellhawk allies. With the habitat in imminent danger of destruction, the Kiint personnel immediately evacuate by triggering their 'Emergency Exodus Facility', personal wormholes that transport them to the real Kiint home star system. An infant Kiint, Haile, decides that she can't let Jay be killed in the attack and activates the Emergency Exodus Facility on her, removing her from Tranquillity as well, to the displeasure of her parents, Nang and Lieria. Jay finds herself on a planet which appears to be just one in a necklace of hundreds orbiting a star in the same orbit. Haile's parents reluctantly confirm that this, the Kiint home system, is actually in another galaxy, and the supposed Kiint homeworld of Jobis was actually just a single scientific outpost. They regretfully announce that Tranquillity has either been destroyed or forced to surrender to the possessed.\nThe Jovian Consensus is placed on an emergency alert when a colossal wormhole opens above Jupiter. They are shocked when the habitat Tranquillity appears. Ione Saldana reveals that Michael Saldana feared that whatever destroyed the Laymil might return to its system, and gave Tranquillity the means to escape that threat.\nThe Lady Macbeth journeys to Trafalgar and there reveal the events of their mission to the First Admiral, who is happy that the Alchemist has been destroyed and Alkad Mzu is no longer at large. Because Joshua Calvert knows the mechanics of the Alchemist he must not risk death due to the event his soul is brought back in a different body and is tortured/interrogated by the possessed about his knowledge of the Alchemist. After thoroughly debriefing the crew, the First Admiral allows them to travel on to Tranquillity. A meeting is held and Ione proposes that Tranquillity and the Jovian Consensus join forces to track down the Tyrathca Sleeping God and see what use it could be in the fight with the possessed. Syrinx and the voidhawk Oenone volunteer for the mission and Joshua Calvert agrees to take the Lady Macbeth on the mission. The"

The story arises from the murder of Rikaine Delmarre, a prominent \"fetologist\" (fetal scientist), responsible for the operation of the planetary birthing center of Solaria, a planet politically hostile to Earth, whose death Elijah Baley is called to investigate, at the request of the Solarian government. He is again partnered with the humanoid robot R. Daneel Olivaw, and asked by Earth's government to assess the Solarian society for weaknesses.\nThe book focuses on the unusual traditions, customs, and culture of Solarian society. The planet has a rigidly controlled population of 20,000, and all work is done by robots, which outnumber humans ten thousand to one.\nNormally the prime suspect in a murder would have been Delmarre's wife Gladia, who was present in the house when he was killed by being beaten over the head. She claims to have no memory of what happened, nor is there any sign of the object used to beat Rikaine Delmarre to death. The only witness is a malfunctioning house robot that has suffered damage to its positronic brain because it allowed harm to be done to a human, in violation of the First Law.\nBaley's first encounter with Gladia is through \"viewing\" (holography), at which point he discovers that Solarians have no taboo about nudity when viewing, though Baley is shocked. Thereafter he develops a relationship with Gladia in face-to-face contact. She reveals to Baley that she does not like all the customs of Solaria, where face-to-face interaction, and especially sex, are considered repugnant, and was on bad terms with Rikaine, partly from sexual frustration.\nThe situation becomes more complex when Hannis Gruer, the Head of Security on Solaria, is poisoned while viewing with Baley. Baley, unable to intervene physically, has to call on Gruer's robots to save him. Baley is able to prevent the house robots from cleaning up the scene and destroying evidence, which happened after Delmarre's death.\nUltimately, it is revealed that Delmarre's neighbor, roboticist Jothan Leebig, was working on putting positronic brains in spaceships. This would negate the First Law, as such ships would not recognize that humans usually inhabit ships, and would therefore be able to attack and destroy other ships without regard for their crews. Delmarre was one of his opponents, as were other Solarians who were horrified by the prospect of robots that could actually harm humans. Leebig poisoned Gruer by tricking his robots, using his knowledge of positronic brains, into putting poison into Gruer's drink. Daneel goes to arrest Leebig, who kills himself in Solarian fear of human contact, not knowing that Daneel is a robot. It is assumed that he also engineered the murder of Rikaine Delmarre. Baley conceals Gladia's role on the grounds that her emotional breakdown was under the pressure of the Solarian way of life. Leebig had instructed the Delmarre house robots to detach an arm and give it to Gladia in the heat of an argument. She then hit her husband with it, killing him, before going into a fugue state, after which she remembered nothing. She decides to emigrate to the Spacer planet of Aurora.\nBaley returns to Earth to acclaim from his boss. Asked by his boss to reveal any weaknesses he found, Baley says that the features once regarded as Spacer strengths; their robots and long lives, will ultimately prove to be weaknesses. They discourage an active, exploratory attitude that Earth-born humans will eventually rediscover once they are able to leave Earth.\nThe story of the after-effects can be found in the sequel The Robots of Dawn.\nGalaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel as \"an interesting exercise in scientific detection ... Asimov appears to be laying the groundwork for a new category of science fiction, the S-F detective story\".\nAsimov portrays in The Naked Sun a world focused on avoiding physical contact with other people. The Solarians practice physical distancing, and interact with each other largely through technology. They live far from each other, spread out across a sparsely populated planet. People are taught from birth to avoid physical contact, and live on huge estates, either alone or with their spouse only. Face-to-face interaction (referred to in the book as \"seeing\") is seen as a repugnant chore. (Other science fiction novels examine the extra-uterine care of fetuses, but this is not Asimov's concern here.) Communication takes place through technology unknown of off their world: holography, 3-D television. At the time of writing, 2-D"

The sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 left Romans in a deep state of shock, and many Romans saw it as punishment for abandoning traditional Roman religion in favor of Christianity. In response to these accusations, and in order to console Christians, Augustine wrote The City of God as an argument for the truth of Christianity over competing religions and philosophies. He argues that Christianity was not responsible for the Sack of Rome but instead responsible for Rome's success. Even if the earthly rule of the Empire was imperiled, it was the City of God that would ultimately triumph.  Augustine's focus was Heaven, a theme of many Christian works of Late Antiquity. Despite Christianity's designation as the official religion of the Empire, Augustine declared its message to be spiritual rather than political. Christianity, he argued, should be concerned with the mystical, heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, rather than with earthly politics.\nThe book presents human history as a conflict between what Augustine calls the Earthly City (often colloquially referred to as the City of Man, but never by Augustine) and the City of God, a conflict that is destined to end in victory for the latter. The City of God is marked by people who forgo earthly pleasure to dedicate themselves to the eternal truths of God, now revealed fully in the Christian faith. The Earthly City, on the other hand, consists of people who have immersed themselves in the cares and pleasures of the present, passing world.\nAugustine\u2019s thesis depicts the history of the world as universal warfare between God and the Devil. This metaphysical war is not limited by time but only by geography on  Earth. In this war, God moves (by divine intervention, Providence) those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Catholic Church (the City of God) in order to oppose by all means\u2014including military\u2014those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Devil (the City of the World).\nThis concept of world history guided by Divine Providence in a universal war between God and the Devil is part of the official doctrine of the Catholic Church as most recently stated in the Second Vatican Council's Gaudium et Spes document: \"The Church\u00a0... holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the goal of man, as well as of all human history\u00a0... all of human life, whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness\u00a0... The Lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings.\"\nPart I (Books I\u2013X): a polemical critique of Roman religion and philosophy, corresponding to the Earthly City\nBook I\u2013V: A critique of pagan religion\nBook I: a criticism of the pagans who attribute the sack of Rome to Christianity despite being saved by taking refuge in Christian churches. The book also explains good and bad things happen to righteous and wicked people alike, and it consoles the women violated in the recent calamity.\nBook II: a proof that because of the worship of the pagan gods, Rome suffered the greatest calamity of all, that is, moral corruption.\nBook III: a proof that the pagan gods failed to save Rome numerous times in the past from worldly disasters, such as the sack of Rome by the Gauls.\nBook IV: a proof that the power and long duration of the Roman empire was due not to the pagan gods but to the Christian God.\nBook V: a refutation of the doctrine of fate and an explanation of the Christian doctrine of free will and its consistency with God's omniscience.

The City of Love begins with the siege of Malacca by the Portuguese in 1510. Fernando Almenara is a Castilian trader captured in the abortive first siege of Malacca. Fernando has a secret: he is fleeing the Inquisition in Florence for his involvement with a Cabalist group there, and the invasion of Florence by the Holy Alliance in 1509 meant death to him and his friends. During the siege he is kidnapped by Daud Suleiman ibn Shams al Basri, a sharp young Arab physician and pirate based in Chittagong. Fernando joins Daud\u2019s ship, the Shaan-e-Dariya, crewed by fugitives and renegades from all over the known world, and comes to their home port.\nChandu Sadashiva is the son of a Shaiva priest exiled from Gaur, West Bengal to the wilds of rural Chittagong. His father Bhairavdas is determined to turn him into a powerful Tantric warrior against the foreign polluters of his land, but Chandu has other ideas. He forms a secret attachment with Bajja, a tribal girl eight years older than he is, who becomes his secret role model and ideal. Things fall apart when Bajja asks Chandu\u2019s father to initiate her into the Tantra but he tries to seduce her and she escapes. Bitterly disappointed, she vows to find enlightenment or die by fasting at the cremation ground. Desperately ill from weeks of starvation, she is rescued by the wise woman Dhumavati who undertakes to train her.\nAt first Fernando\u2019s band of pirates does well from their excellent piratical harbour, but then the Portuguese come to Chittagong and change the rules with their cannon and brutal ways. The pirate band breaks up, Fernando runs from agents of the Inquisition and falls in love with Bajja deep in the forest. Bajja is being taught the Sahajiya Buddhist Tantra by Dhumavati, while Fernando has training in the Christian Cabala, and together he and Bajja teach each other about love and the lore.\nMeanwhile, thirteen-year-old Chandu and his father have set out for Gaur to begin Chandu\u2019s formal training, but they are ambushed on the way, Bhairavdas is killed and Chandu wounded in the throat and sold into slavery. Daud, who is travelling with a wandering Sufi, rescues and heals him. Chandu, temporarily speechless, is apprenticed to a blacksmith and takes the name Kalketu, having lost his Brahminical heritage. He becomes an accomplished Sufi qawwal or devotional singer.\nBajja is now wandering the countryside, teaching other Tantrics her wisdom in secret places, but she is becoming disillusioned with the way Dhumavati treats their followers. Finally Dhumavati persuades her to take part in a Tantric ritual which involves killing a child, and in disgust she gives up the life of a guru and disappears to seek her own truth. Fernando is crushed, and he returns to Chittagong where he agrees to return to Amsterdam with an old shipmate and join the Family of Love.\nIn the background of Sher Shah Suri\u2019s and Humayun\u2019s invasions of Bengal (1538\u20131540), Chandu sets off to look for Bajja and finds her herding pigs on top of a desolate mountain in Assam. They speak of all that has befallen them, lie down and make love.\nThe first part of the book is set against the spice trade from Antwerp to Indonesia, the greatest network of goods and ideas the world has ever known, and the struggle for supremacy in Chittagong between Bengal, Tripura and Arakan, and the Portuguese empire. In this cultural cauldron, established Hindu and Buddhist Tantric, Vaishnav and tribal traditions meet the three-centuries-old incursion of Islam and the dawning of contact with the West.\nDaud had closed his eyes and sat with his hands folded in his lap, one hand sometimes softly tapping the other. Fernando closed his eyes too. At first he felt nothing, then subtly the music changed. Without the light and glitter to distract him, it seemed to reach inside the darkness behind his eyes and gently cut him loose from himself. Pir Baba\u2019s voice wove like a hummingbird around a note, climbed, danced with another. He seemed to sing alone, though the others followed his lead and he courteously let them repeat what he sang. He led them to places of melody they could never have reached on their own, and yet he was always a step ahead of them, teaching, teasing. His voice sounded as though many years of waiting for an answer from God had put pain into it along with joy, as though it had become a direct channel for a longing that could never be assuaged. It was a strong voice because it had known weakness, and it took Fernando in the cup of its hands and bore him aloft into the sky.\nSahara Time\nDeccan Herald\nHindustan Times\nIndo-Asian"

The prologue shows a young boy dying of a drug overdose in a slum in Washington, D.C. The boy's grandmother works as a maid in the White House. When the President inadvertently hears of this, he decides to end the international cocaine trade. Paul Devereaux, who previously appeared in the Forsyth novel Avenger, is tasked by the U.S. President to end the international cocaine trade. He recruits lawyer Cal Dexter, the main character in Avenger and a highly decorated Vietnam War veteran who served in the \u00e9lite tunnel rat unit, to help him with this task. Together they set up a joint Anglo-American task force operating from 2 converted grain carriers transformed into Q-ships to intercept cocaine shipments, destroy the ships and to detain the crews on a remote island. Both teams have access to a UAV that provides them with target information and other intelligence. Dexter also recruits a Blackburn Buccaneer pilot to shoot down the cartel's cocaine-carrying airplanes. He also obtains a list of corrupt officials who allow the cocaine to enter their country and exposes them. When the actions of both task forces and the pilot lead to major international cocaine shortages, Devereaux starts a disinformation campaign aimed at turning the international drug cartels against each other. Since this leads to out-of-hand gang wars with innocent bystanders getting killed, Devereaux is eventually asked by the White House to stop all operations. Dissatisfied by the White House decision, Devereaux cuts a deal with a drug lord promising him the cocaine captured by the task forces. He tells Dexter the location of the captured cocaine and tells him to destroy it. However, it turns out to be fake and Cal Dexter finds out about this and has the Buccaneer pilot destroy the cocaine-carrying ship before it reaches its destination. In the epilogue, Devereaux's assassinated body is discovered: the drug lord, Don Diego Esteban, has taken his revenge on him for breaking his deal.\nThe novel has been lauded for its background research, but the Washington Post reviewer found the characters lacking in depth, and the plot often unconvincing, \"a fantasy that spins out of control\".\nClear and Present Danger, Tom Clancy's 1989 novel with a similar premise\n\"Frederick Forsyth's new thriller, \"The Cobra,\" reviewed by Patrick Anderson\".

The story is told out of chronological order.\nAqib, a distant relative of the royal family of Olorum, is the assistant keeper of the royal Menagerie. He meets Lucrio, an ambassador from the Dalu\u00e7an kingdom. An attraction develops between then, despite an Olorumi prohibition against same-sex relationships. Ten days later, Lucrio boards a ship to return to his homeland with his new Olorumi wife. Aqib attempts to swim out to the ship, but is dragged back to shore by his brother, the Corporal.\nAqib and Lucrio make love on the night after they meet; they continue to have nightly trysts for the duration of Lucrio's stay. Three days after Lucrio leaves, the princess Femysade chooses Aqib as her husband; they marry and have a daughter, Lucretia. Aqib is summoned to a meeting with two Olorumi deities, who grant him the ability to communicate with animals. Femysade leaves her family to live with the gods.\nIn the Royal Menagerie, Lucrio asks Aqib to leave Olorum with him. Torn between love for Lucrio and loyalty to his family and religion, Aqib declines. Later that night, he regrets this choice and attempts to leave, but is prevented by his father and the Corporal. Due to Femysade's jealousy, the gods erase all memories of Lucrio from Aqib's mind. At the age of 89, Aqib dies.\nIt is revealed that Aqib actually chose to leave the Menagerie with Lucrio. For decades, he wondered if he had made the correct choice. Once per lifetime, a Sibylline Oracle allows supplicants to ask for one miracle. The Oracle offered Aqib the chance to live another life as if he had stayed in Olorum. In return for this vision, Aqib dips his hand into a jar of honey, and the Oracle consumes it. Aqib realizes that he made the correct choice. Despite the fact that Lucretia does not exist, he and Lucrio have made their own family in Daluz. Aqib realizes that he can now understand the language of animals, just as he did in his vision of another life.\nA Taste of Honey has received positive reviews from fantasy authors such as N.K. Jemisin, as well as positive reviews in The Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, and Booklist. The story received praise for its unconventional plot structure. It was nominated for the 2016 Nebula Award for Best Novella, 2017 Hugo Award for Best Novella, 2017 Locus Award for Best Novella, 2017 Theodore Sturgeon Award, and 2017 World Fantasy Award for Long Fiction.\n\"Revealing the Cover for Kai Ashante Wilson's A Taste of Honey\".

Hume starts out with an important point that touches upon a key fact of economics that many fail to recognize even in the 21st century: Allowing the sale or export of a good actually increases its production. Economic activity in trade is not a fixed-slice pie, but one where freedom to trade can create more, rather than less.\nIt is very usual, in nations ignorant of the nature of commerce, to prohibit the exportation of commodities, and to preserve among themselves whatever they think valuable and useful. They do not consider, that, in this prohibition, they act directly contrary to their intention; and that the more is exported of any commodity, the more will be raised at home, of which they themselves will always have the first offer.\nHe uses, as example, the ridiculous (his word) behavior of the ancient Athenian government, in banning the export of a certain kind of fig deemed too delicious for mere foreigners...but he goes on to cite similar errors in contemporary England and France, as well.\nIn modern economic terms, this is equilibration through the price-specie flow mechanism. In other words, money moves around where it's needed, forever seeking a balance.\nThis means that not only does a country not need to limit exports, but also need not limit imports, because the money flowing out of the economy will create more demand for money, helping bring it back in.\nHume's essay is the first known establishment of the concept of the Price-Specie Flow Mechanism, and perhaps still the best, cited by Paul Krugman and John Maynard Keynes on one end of the political spectrum, and Austrian economists on the other.\nOf the Balance of Trade\nMurray N.

In The Emigrants, Sebald's narrator recounts his involvement with and the life stories of four different characters, all of whom are emigrants (to England and the United States). As with most of Sebald's work, the text includes many black and white, unlabeled photographs and strays sharply from general formats of plot and narrative.\nDr. Henry Selwyn is the estranged husband of Sebald's landlady. Selwyn fought in the First World War and has an interest in gardening and tending to animals. He confides in Sebald about his Lithuanian Jewish family's immigration to England from Lithuania, and suspects that it is this secretive, alien past that contributed to the dissolution of his relationship with his wife. He commits suicide by inserting a gun in his mouth.\nPaul Bereyter was the narrator's childhood teacher in a town referenced in the text only as \"S\". A quarter Jewish, he found employment difficult in the period leading up to the Second World War, although he eventually served in the Wehrmacht. Teaching in the small school after the war, Bereyter found a passion for his students while living a lonely, quiet life. In later years, his eyesight began to fail and he moved to France, where he met and spent much time with Mme Landau, from whom the narrator obtains most of his information about Bereyter. Like Selwyn, Bereyter commits suicide, by lying down on railway tracks.\nThe narrator's great uncle, Ambros Adelwarth, was the travelling companion of Cosmo Solomon, an affluent American aviator, gifted with much luck at gambling and a wayward attitude towards life. In his youth, he accompanied this man across Europe, and into Turkey and Asia Minor, before Cosmo fell ill and was sent to a mental institution. It is implied that there may have been some homosexual feelings between the two men. After Cosmo's death, Adelwarth was the butler of the young man's family, living on Long Island until first Cosmo's father, then second wife, died. In his later years, Ambros falls victim to an extreme depression which causes him to commit himself to the same institution that once held Cosmo. He allows and, in his own way, even encourages increasingly frequent and brutal electro-convulsive therapy to be performed on him by the institution's fanatical director.\nAs a young man in Manchester the narrator befriends an expatriate German-Jewish painter, Max Ferber. Years later the artist gives the narrator his mother's history of her idyllic life as a girl in a Bavarian village. It was written as she and her husband awaited deportation to the East and death. This section is written as a gradual discovery on the narrator's part of the effects of the Holocaust on Ferber and his family.\nThe Emigrants is largely concerned with memory, trauma, and feelings of foreignness. For example, Dr. Selwyn dwells on the story of a man he met in Switzerland in the time immediately prior to World War I, and explains how he felt a deeper companionship with this man than he ever did his wife. He also divulges how his family emigrated from Lithuania as a young boy, and tries to get the narrator to reveal how he feels being an emigrant from Germany living in England. In acknowledgement of this motif, Lisa Cohen of the Boston Review points out that The Emigrants'  section-title characters \"suffer[ ] from memory and from the compulsion to obliterate it; from a mourning and melancholia so deep that it is almost unnamable; from the knowledge that he has survived while those he loved have not; from problems distinguishing dream and reality; from a profound sense of displacement.\"\nA concomitant theme is the impact of World War II and the Holocaust on German nationals, particularly on those of Jewish heritage. All the characters in the work are emigrants who have left Germany or a Germanised community, each specific case has its nuances. For example, Paul Bereyter remains in his homeland but becomes an outsider because of the persecution he experiences as a Jew; Ambros Adelwarth is a non-Jewish character, but has close affiliations with a family of German-Jewish emigrants as the family's major-domo, and the affiliation makes him feel the angst of the war more sharply from abroad. Generally speaking, the narratives explore the different senses in which the characters' homeland can remain with them\u2014in the form of both memories and memorabilia\u2014as they approach the end of their lives.\nThe character Max Aurach's last name, which is close to the name of his real-world inspiration, Frank Auerbach, was changed to Ferber in English translations.\nUpon publication, the English version"

The novel-series describes the long and strenuous journey for a party of emigrants from the province of Sm\u00e5land, Sweden, to the United States in 1850, coinciding with the beginning of the first significant wave of immigration to the United States from Sweden. The story focuses primarily on Karl-Oskar Nilsson and his wife, Kristina Johansdotter, a young married couple who live with their four small children; Anna, Johan, Lill-M\u00e4rta, and Harald, as well as Karl-Oskar's parents and his rebellious younger brother Robert, who works as a hired farmhand for neighboring farmers. The family lives on a small farm at Korpamoen, where the soil is thin and rocky, making growing crops extremely difficult. It is Robert, together with his friend Arvid, who first comes across the prospect of going to America after being tired of being mistreated by the farmers who employ him. When he confronts Karl-Oskar about the idea, Karl-Oskar reveals that he too has come across pamphlets describing conditions in North America for farmers as being much better. Kristina, however, is adamantly against emigrating, not wanting to leave her homeland or wanting to risk the lives of her children by taking them across the ocean. However, things take yet another tragic turn for the family which causes Kristina to reconsider. In the winter of 1849, on the day of the christening of their youngest child, Harald, Kristina is preparing a large bowl of barley porridge. Their eldest child, four-year-old Anna, determined to have some even after being told she cannot, goes into the cellar where it is left to cool and helps herself to a very large amount of it, so much that she falls terribly ill from it. Karl-Oskar and Kristina send for Beata, a healing woman from Idemo, who upon seeing Anna tells them that after consuming so much porridge, Anna's stomach had burst. The child lingers in agony through the night before dying early the following morning, after which Kristina agrees for them to make the journey to America (Minnesota). \nIn their preparation for their emigration to the United States, Karl-Oskar, Kristina, their three remaining children and Robert are joined by Kristina's uncle and aunt, Danjel and Inga-Lena Andreasson and their four children. Danjel Andreasson is the pastor of a local conventicle of the Radical Pietistic \u00c5kianer sect and has suffered relentless persecution at the hands of the Government-controlled Church of Sweden. For this reason, Danjel Andreasson seeks the religious freedom promised in the Constitution of the United States. He is joined by a member of his conventicle, Ulrika of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6hl, a former prostitute who seeking to start a new life in America for herself and her illegitimate teenage daughter Elin. Along with Ulrika and Elin, Danjel had also agreed to pay Arvid's passage to America after hiring him as a farmhand. The party was finally joined by Jonas Petter, a friend of Karl-Oskar who was fleeing an unhappy marriage. \nThe party sets off by wagon for the Swedish port city of Karlshamn, on the Baltic Sea, where they board the brig Charlotta, bound for New York City, as emigrants.\nThe novels have to date been sold in nearly two million copies in Sweden and have been translated into more than twenty languages.\nThe series was in a poll conducted by Biblioteket i fokus (\"Library in focus\") in 1997 voted as the best Swedish book of the 20th century by 27,000 people.\nThe series was in a poll conducted by Sveriges television in 1998 voted as the most important Swedish book of all time by 17,000 people.\nTwo movies based on the books have been released, starring Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullmann as Karl-Oskar and Kristina:\nThe Emigrants, a 1971 adaption by Jan Troell, based on the first two novels.\nThe New Land, a 1972 sequel to the first film, based on the last two novels.\nAdditionally, Kristina fr\u00e5n Duvem\u00e5la, a musical by former ABBA members Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, was produced in the 1990s.

The book opens with the narrator telling readers about a little old woman nicknamed \"The Lupine Lady\" who \"lives in a small house overlooking the sea.\" The story of her Great Aunt, Miss Rumphius, begins to unfold, starting when her aunt was just a little girl named Alice.\nIn illustrations depicting the late 1800s, a young Alice lives with her grandparents near a waterfront shipping town. Her grandfather, an immigrant who arrived by boat to America himself, now carves the figureheads for sailing ships in his old age. At night, he regales his granddaughter with stories of exotic places across the sea. Inspired, Alice tells her grandfather that, when she grows up, she will travel to faraway places and settle down by the sea when she grows old, just as he did. He agrees that her plans are \"all very well,\" but goes on to tell her that she must do one more thing: \"You must do something to make the world more beautiful.\" Alice resolves to follow her grandfather's advice, though she is not sure how.\n\nFor a time, life goes on normally and, eventually, Alice grows up. She goes to work in a library where people call her Miss Rumphius and she helps them find books they're looking for. It is in the library where she learns about more faraway places. Time continues to pass and streaks of gray appear in her hair. \nIn her spare time, she likes to visit the local conservatory where she can linger among the exotic plants and dream of the places from which they originally came. She decides she finally needs to go see those places for herself. \nHer first trip abroad takes her to Indonesia where she befriends the king of a fishing village. From there, she goes on to climb snowy mountains, trek through jungles, and walk across deserts as she travels to many of the faraway places she promised herself she would go. While traveling in the \"Land of the Lotus-Eaters\" (Tunisia in North Africa), however, she hurts her back getting off a camel and decides that it's time to find her place by the sea.\nAfter returning to America and settling into a cottage overlooking the water, Miss Rumphius\u2014an older woman now\u2014begins to wonder how she might accomplish the final task her grandfather told her she must do to \"make the world more beautiful,\" but her back injury worsens and, for some time, it is unclear if she will be able to complete the task. As she rests and tries to recover, she reflects on how much she loves the lupines outside her bedroom window, and, after discovering a patch of them farther along the cliffs near her home, she realizes how she can accomplish her third and final goal. \nShe sends off for as many lupine seeds as she can acquire and begins scattering them all over her community\u2014along cliffside roads, near buildings in town, along stone walls, and in hollows between hills. People who see her think she's crazy, but the following spring, it becomes clear she accomplished her goal; her community is bursting with colorful lupines growing everywhere and she has made the world more beautiful.\nThe story concludes with the young narrator (who we learn is also named Alice) telling readers that her great Aunt Alice is now very old\u2014so old that local children drop by her home to see who they believe is the oldest woman in the world. She tells them stories of her faraway adventures. As in the beginning, the young Alice tells her she would like to see the world when she grows up and \"come home to live by the sea.\" But just as Miss Rumphius' own grandfather did before her, the elder Alice reminds the younger of the third thing she must yet do\u2014\"something to make the world more beautiful.\" And, much like her great aunt when she was her age, the young narrator admits that she does \"not yet know what that can be.\"\nDespite the book having been published some 40 years ago, the story of Miss Rumphius has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years for its socially relevant mores and themes. The most immediate lesson is the ability every individual has to determine what they would like to do with their life and how they can have a powerful, long-lasting impact on their world should they so choose. Additional themes of female independence, singleness, the impact travel can have in teaching about cultural diversity, and the transformative power of beauty as it is portrayed in Miss Rumphius have all been discussed in numerous articles and blogs.\nThough not expressly a work of feminist literature, the main character of Miss Rumphius is viewed by many as a brave woman whose independent lifestyle was ahead of her time.

The work was originally entitled The Veil of Isis, a title which remains on the heading of each page, but had to be renamed once Blavatsky discovered that this title had already been used for an 1861 Rosicrucian work by W.W. Reade. Isis Unveiled is divided into two volumes. Volume I, The 'Infallibility' of Modern Science, discusses occult science and the hidden and unknown forces of nature, exploring such subjects as forces, elementals, psychic phenomena, and the Inner and Outer Man. Volume II, Theology, discusses the similarity of Christian scripture to Eastern religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, the Vedas, and Zoroastrianism. It follows the Renaissance notion of prisca theologia, in that all these religions purportedly descend from a common source; the ancient \"Wisdom-Religion\". Blavatsky writes in the preface that Isis Unveiled is \"a plea for the recognition of the Hermetic philosophy, the anciently universal Wisdom-Religion, as the only possible key to the Absolute in science and theology.\"\nIsis Unveiled is argued by many modern scholars such as Bruce F. Campbell and Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke to be a milestone in the history of Western Esotericism. Blavatsky gathered a number of themes central to the occult tradition\u2014perennial philosophy, a Neo-Platonic emanationist cosmology, adepts, esoteric Christianity\u2014and reinterpreted them in relation to current developments in science and new knowledge of non-Western faiths. In doing so, Isis Unveiled reflected many contemporary controversies\u2014such as Darwin's theories on evolution and their impact on religion\u2014and engaged in a discussion that appealed to intelligent individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms. Blavatsky's combination of original insights, backed by scholarly and scientific sources, accomplished a major statement of modern occultism's defiance of materialist science.\nIn later theosophical works some of the doctrines originally stated in Isis Unveiled appeared in a significantly altered form, drawing out confusion among readers and even causing some to perceive contradiction. Specifically, the few and\u2014according to many\u2014ambiguous statements on reincarnation as well as the threefold conception of man as body, soul and spirit of Isis Unveiled stand in contrast to the elaborate and definite conception of reincarnation as well as the sevenfold conception of man in The Secret Doctrine (1888).  Blavatsky later asserted the correctness of her statements on reincarnation and the constitution of man in Isis Unveiled, attributing the resulting confusion and alleged contradictions to the more superficial or simplified conceptions of the ideas in Isis Unveiled compared to those of later works.\nModern Theosophists hold the book as a revealed work dictated to Blavatsky by Theosophy's Masters.\nDetractors often accuse the book of extensive plagiarism, a view first seriously put forth by William Emmette Coleman shortly after publication and still expressed by modern scholars such as Mark Sedgwick. Similarly, Geoffrey Ashe notes that Isis Unveiled combines \"comparative religion, occultism, pseudoscience, and fantasy in a m\u00e9lange that shows genuine if superficial research but is not free from unacknowledged borrowing and downright plagiarism.\" Indeed, Isis Unveiled makes use of many sources popular among occultists at the time, often directly copying significant amounts of text. However, rather than dwelling on the plagiarism, scholars such as Bruce Campbell argue: \"Blavatsky was a person who had an original set of insights but who lacked the literary skills and knowledge of English sufficient to create a work on her own. Relying on written sources and help from friends, she formulated a unique and powerful expression of occult ideas.\" Joscelyn Godwin and K. Paul Johnson note that early scholarship seemed obsessed with the agenda of exposing Helena Blavatsky as a plagiarist and imposter, but such labels do not properly assess the Theosophical Society's place in the cultural, political, religious, and intellectual history of modern times. The work belongs to a broader movement that seeks to integrate the history of the occult sciences and of esoteric movements with more established subdisciplines. Modern copies of Isis Unveiled are often annotated, fully delineating Blavatsky's sources and influences.\nTheosophical scholar Moon Laramie goes a step further in Blavatsky Unveiled Volume 1 rendering the first seven chapters of Isis Unveiled into contemporary English. In addition, the book corrects many misconceptions about Blavatsky\u2019s sources. For example, Blavatsky cites the work of the Byzantine historian"

Max wrote in The New York Times, \"This is an absorbing book, diminished sometimes by the choppy way Ackerman balances Antonina's account with the larger story of the Warsaw Holocaust. For me, the more interesting story is Antonina's. She was not, as her husband once called her, \"a housewife,\" but the alpha female in a unique menagerie.\"\nFor Orion Magazine Susanne Antonetta wrote: \"Ackerman, with her profound understanding of nature, tells Antonina's story in a way that makes it clear her roles as the zookeeper's wife and heroine of the Resistance are inextricably connected, both in what the natural world has taught her, and taught her to accept.\"\nOn February 10, 2008, the book was number 13 on The New York Times non-fiction best seller list.\nIn 2008, The Zookeeper's Wife won the annual Orion Book Award from Orion Magazine; the selection committee noted, \"The Zookeeper's Wife is a groundbreaking work of nonfiction in which the human relationship to nature is explored in an absolutely original way through looking at the Holocaust.\"\nIn 2013, plans were announced for an eponymous feature film adaptation.

The novel went out of print for many years and slipped into obscurity, but there was a resurgence of interest in it in the 1990s after the film adaptation, Get Carter, gradually grew in reputation. The book was republished in paperback under the title Get Carter by Allison & Busby in 1993.

Jack's Return Home tells the story of Jack Carter, an amoral, pitiless London mob enforcer who returns to his home town to investigate the mysterious death of his brother, with whom he had not spoken in many years. Jack's presence in the town causes unease among the local crime families, who fear that his snooping will interfere with their underworld operations. Everything from simple suggestion to brute force is employed to try to get him to leave, but he doggedly refuses, bullying his way through numerous attempts on his life to arrive at the truth, leading to a violent and ambiguous conclusion.\nThe novel has so far been filmed three times, as Get Carter in 1971 and the 2000 remake, and as Hit Man in 1972.\nJack Carter was featured in two prequel novels, both written by Lewis.\nJack Carter's Law (1974)\nJack Carter and the Mafia Pigeon (1976)\nThe first printing of the paperback which tied in with the film version was published under the title Carter (Pan Books 1971, ISBN\u00a00-330-02620-8).  All references on the cover of the book also refer to the film under this title.\nThe character of Jack Carter, though not fully named for copyright reasons, plays a key role in the Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill graphic novel League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Century: 1969. The story takes place during 1969, shortly before Jack's visit 'up north' and the events of Jack's Return Home."

It tells the story of a gambler and racketeer, Ned Beaumont, whose devotion to Paul Madvig, a crooked political boss, leads him to investigate the murder of a local senator's son as a potential gang war brews. Hammett dedicated the novel to his onetime lover Nell Martin. There have been two US film adaptations (1935 and 1942) of the novel. A radio adaptation starring Orson Welles aired on March 10, 1939, as part of his Campbell Playhouse series. ...",

Knopf). The story revolves around Ned Beaumont, a gambler and best friend of the criminal political boss Paul Madvig. Ned finds the body of a senator's son on the street, and Madvig asks him to thwart the D.A.'s investigation, his motive being that he wants to back the corrupt senator in order to marry his daughter, Janet. Ned goes to New York searching for Bernie, a bookie who owes him a great deal of money from a gambling debt but ends up getting beaten up.\nSomeone sends a series of letters to people close to the crime, hinting that Madvig was the murderer. Suspicion for this falls on Madvig's daughter Opal, the victim's girlfriend. Madvig's political base begins to crumble when he refuses to spring a follower's brother from jail. The follower goes to rival mob boss Shad O'Rory, who eliminates a witness to the brother's crime. Madvig then declares war on O'Rory, who offers to bribe Beaumont to expose Madvig in the newspaper. Beaumont refuses, is knocked unconscious and wakes captive in a dingy room where he is beaten daily.\nHospitalized after his escape, Beaumont tells Madvig and Janet that he was laying a trap for O'Rory; he then struggles out of bed to stop the newspaper from printing its expose. Beaumont confronts O'Rory, the publisher, and Madvig's daughter Opal. The publisher commits suicide, after Beaumont seduces his wife.\nNext Beaumont interviews Janet, discovering that she wrote the letters and that the Senator knew about the murder before Beaumont found the body. A new clue points to Madvig and when confronted he confesses but he cannot account for the victim's hat, a detail Beaumont pointedly repeats throughout the novel.\nThis impasse and Beaumont's growing interest in Janet, Madvig's love interest, cause a second rift between the men.

Out-of-work former cavalryman and tank inspector Captain Richard is offered a job interview with a \"catch\" by a former comrade, Twinnings: namely, he suggests a morally questionable position with Giacomo Zapparoni, whose firm builds advanced robots; occasionally one of his engineers deserts, and he needs a man to \"take care of\" the problem to protect company secrets. At this point a reluctant Richard offers the first of many essayistic narrative asides, as he outlines the social magnitude of Zapparoni's creations, and the first of many autobiographical flashbacks, recounting his days in Military Academy under the guidance of his strict yet caring instructor, Monteron.\nTwo days later, while nervously awaiting Zapparoni, Richard notices how Zapparoni's modest house appears strangely old-fashioned for a man who made his vast fortune in robotics. This tension between new and old prompts Richard to nostalgically reflect upon the historic demise of cavalry, supplanted by mechanized modern warfare. The suicide of his comrade Lorenz, who refused to adapt to the vertiginous pace of technological, social change, figures prominently in his reflection; for Richard, Lorenz's death exemplifies the fate of those who cannot \"find firm ground under [their] feet in the present\". Richard's ruminations then turn inward, as he narrates his own lack of worldly success and his negative evaluations by superiors as an \"outsider with defeatist inclinations.\"\nWhen the elderly Zapparoni finally makes his entrance, Richard senses his latent power, remarking that there is more to him than his intelligence. In a narrative aside prompted by a question from Zapparoni, Richard contrasts his former comrades Fillmor, Lorenz, and Twinnings. Unlike either Lorenz and Twinnings, Fillmor, now a successful high officer, is driven entirely by ambition, yet totally lacks imagination. So when Zapparoni asks Richard for his opinion on Fillmor's memoir, Richard is unsure how to respond. Over the course of a tactical conversation, Zapparoni begins with familiar territory for Richard, namely war, yet is quickly able to master the discussion, forcing Richard into contortions and self-contradictions. Zapparoni then announces that he has other matters to attend to, and asks Richard to wait for him in the garden, warning him to beware of the bees.\nOut in the garden Richard, through a pair of sophisticated binoculars, discovers the glass bees. Watching them, he observes how these robotic bees are much more efficient at gathering nectar than real bees, and marvels at their construction. As he watches the bees, he notices a pond filled with severed ears. Richard briefly considers contacting the police but realizes that the powerful Zapparoni could easily frame him.\nRichard's predicament spurs a childhood reminiscence about Atje Hanebut, \"chief\" of Richard's neighborhood gang. One day, Atje has them savagely beat a member of a rival gang. Richard tries to stop Atje, calling his attention to the boy's bleeding nose, for which Atje has the boys beat Richard, after which they flee. The rival gang then finds Richard, beating him further in retaliation. Finally at home, Richard is beaten once more, this time by his father.\nLeaving the garden, Richard encounters Zapparoni, who reveals that the ears had been severed from humanoid robots, and were a test that Richard has unfortunately failed. Zapparoni then surprises Richard by offering him a different job requiring sharp moral discrimination, which Richard accepts. On the way home, Richard buys Teresa a red dress, they go out for dinner, and Richard begins to forget the events in Zapparoni's garden.\nThe Glass Bees combines the semi-autobiographical narrative and reflections of the narrator, explicitly thematizing such topics as war, technological and historical change, morality, authenticity, and semantic change. It is classified as one of Ernst J\u00fcnger's later works. With its simultaneous nostalgia for militaristic order and deep suspicion of technocratic modernity, it is exemplary of this ambiguity in J\u00fcnger's work.\nThe Glass Bees, like another of J\u00fcnger's novels, Heliopolis, thematizes the altered relationship between technology, society, and nature; set in a future world in which the distinction between war and peace has been largely effaced. The novel's setting has been variously characterized as \"an unspecified future\" and a \"dystopia.\" While some aspects of the novel's geography"

Knopf). The story revolves around Ned Beaumont, a gambler and best friend of the criminal political boss Paul Madvig. Ned finds the body of a senator's son on the street, and Madvig asks him to thwart the D.A.'s investigation, his motive being that he wants to back the corrupt senator in order to marry his daughter, Janet. Ned goes to New York searching for Bernie, a bookie who owes him a great deal of money from a gambling debt but ends up getting beaten up.\nSomeone sends a series of letters to people close to the crime, hinting that Madvig was the murderer. Suspicion for this falls on Madvig's daughter Opal, the victim's girlfriend. Madvig's political base begins to crumble when he refuses to spring a follower's brother from jail. The follower goes to rival mob boss Shad O'Rory, who eliminates a witness to the brother's crime. Madvig then declares war on O'Rory, who offers to bribe Beaumont to expose Madvig in the newspaper. Beaumont refuses, is knocked unconscious and wakes captive in a dingy room where he is beaten daily.\nHospitalized after his escape, Beaumont tells Madvig and Janet that he was laying a trap for O'Rory; he then struggles out of bed to stop the newspaper from printing its expose. Beaumont confronts O'Rory, the publisher, and Madvig's daughter Opal. The publisher commits suicide, after Beaumont seduces his wife.\nNext Beaumont interviews Janet, discovering that she wrote the letters and that the Senator knew about the murder before Beaumont found the body. A new clue points to Madvig and when confronted he confesses but he cannot account for the victim's hat, a detail Beaumont pointedly repeats throughout the novel.\nThis impasse and Beaumont's growing interest in Janet, Madvig's love interest, cause a second rift between the men. Beaumont and Janet pair up to solve the murder. Beaumont uncovers evidence proving the senator killed his own son and turns him over to the police.

After declaring independence from colonial Spain in May 1811, land-locked Paraguay established itself as the first Republic of South America. Dr. Francia was elected by the junta (or congress) to office and he established himself as dictator for life, until his death in 1840. He ruled with a despotic populism in which the ideals he had drawn from the philosophers of the French Enlightenment were tempered by his aristocratic insistence on absolute rule. As John T. Deiner explains, he \"created an army in which all citizens were required to serve.  He confiscated property from the upper classes and used the state's coercive power to direct the working of that land by the army.\" He also isolated the country from the outside world, restricting foreign trade and mobility. Political opposition was not tolerated.\nFrancia's rule was the beginning of a long line of dictators, including Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez (who was president of Paraguay with dictatorial powers from 1844 to 1862) and L\u00f3pez's son, Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (who ruled between 1862 and 1870).  It was Solano L\u00f3pez who unwisely initiated the Paraguayan War (1864\u201370), which crippled Paraguay, reduced its population by half, and forced many others into exile, creating a Paraguay that Roa Bastos described as \"the land without men of the men without land.\"\nIn the twentieth-century, Paraguay was dominated by the dictatorial figure of Alfredo Stroessner, who ruled the country for thirty-five years (from 1954 to 1989) and was in power at the time at which Roa Bastos was writing I, the Supreme. Roa Bastos's novel can be perceived as in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner, who ruled Paraguay even longer than Francia. He came to power after the 1947 Civil War, which had destroyed all parties of the centre and the left and drove more than a third of Paraguay's population into exile. He assumed presidency after a series of coups in 1954. He gained complete control of the military, eliminated potential rivals, and closely monitored and participated in allocations of national resources. As Deiner argues, \"The novel\u2019s El Supremo (Francia) and Stroessner in the twentieth century used similar methods for dominating national politics. Neither tolerated effective opposition. Both rulers were extremely suspicious of any potential opponents, quickly acting to imprison and torture anyone suspected. Both were ruthless in their intolerance of dissent.\" As Rowe and Whitfield describe Stroessner's rule, \"he inherited all Francia's despotism, but none of his populism [. . .] he rule[d] over a country where human and civil rights are honored only in their breach.\"\nLiterary critic Todd Garth argues that I, the Supreme is influenced by twentieth-century Argentine writer Macedonio Fern\u00e1ndez, as well as other avant garde artists such as Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cort\u00e1zar. Garth suggests that Macedonio and Roa Bastos are similar in use of metaphysical language and techniques used to reconstruct reality, as Dr. Francia does in his dictated creation of the Supreme, the ruler of all reality. Macedonio's writing utilized characters that did not fit the archetype of Western fiction, each only having meaning through their interaction with others in a collective and often never experiencing growth or development in order to construct atemporal spaces of mythmaking that challenge reality. Roa Bastos borrows from these ideas yet situates them in existing political and social history to challenge perceived conceptions of the past's factuality. He dismantles national Paraguayan mythology which is so intimately intertwined with the life of Dr. Francia, elucidating the distinctions between mythic and mythological. The novel can only accomplish this task within the metaphysical space of mythmaking. Whereas Macedonio attacks the concept of the individual as subject while admitting the fact that to write makes oneself a subject, Roa Bastos recognizes this paradox and exploits it, utilizing it in concerns of political and social nature.\nThemes from Plato and his influence on Western political philosophy are also prevalent in the novel. Mainly, the debate over the nature of 'Good Society' and how to achieve it are seen in the positions of the Supreme. He argues that it is the ruler's"

A Symbolist work, it arguably foreshadows James Joyce's Modernist ambitions. First published in  1913, the novel received little attention and was not translated into English until 1959 by John Cournos, over 45 years after it was written.\nToday the book is generally considered Bely's masterpiece; Vladimir Nabokov ranked it one of the four greatest \"masterpieces of twentieth century prose\", after Ulysses and The Metamorphosis, and before \"the first half\" of In Search of Lost Time.\nIn 1922 Bely published in Berlin a revised edition which was shorter by a third than the first one. As Bely noted, \"the new edition is a completely new book for the readers of the first edition\". As critics note, in the Berlin version Bely has changed the foot of his rhitmic prose from anapaest to amphibrach and removed ironical passages related to the revolutionary movent. The second version is usually considered as inferior to the first one.\nThe novel is the second part of Bely's unfinished trilogy East or West, while The Silver Dove is the first one.\nApollon Apollonovich Ableukhov - A senior official in the Russian Imperial government.\nNikolai Apollonovich Ableukhfov (Nikolenka/Kolenka) - Apollon Apollonovich's son; a student involved in radical politics.\nAnna Petrovna Ableukhova - Apollon Apollonovich's estranged wife and Nikolai's mother; lives in Spain.\nSofya Petrovna Likhutina (Angel Peri) - A socialite who runs an informal salon from her apartment.\nMavrushka - Sofya Petrovna's maid.\nSergei Sergeyevich Likhutin (Seryozhka) - A second lieutenant in the Gregorian Regiment; Sofya's husband; Nikolai Apollonovich's childhood friend.\nNikolai Stepanovich Lippanchenko (Lipensky) - Attends Sofya Petrovna's salon and is leader of the local \"Party\".\nVarvara Yevgrafovna Solovyova - An intellectual well versed in Marxist theory; friends with Sofya Petrovna; involved with the party.\nNikolai Petrovich Tsukatov (Coco) -A wealthy man who hosts a ball attended by many of the main characters.\nLyubov' Alekseyevna Tsukatova - Nikolai Petrovich's wife.\nLeib Hussar Shporyshev - Attends Sofya Petrovna's salon.\nBaron Ommau-Ommergau -  A \"yellow cuirassier\"; attends Sofya Petrovna's salon.\nCount Aven - A \"blue cuirassier\";  attends Sofya Petrovna's salon.\nHerman Hermanovich Verhefden - A clerk in Apollon Apollonovich's office; attends Sofya Petrovna's salon.\nAleksandr Ivanovich Dudkin - A former political prisoner and local party operative reporting to Lippanchenko.\nZoya Zakharovna  Fleisch - Lives with  Lippanchenko and is probably a party member.\nPavel Yakovlevich Morkovin or Voronkov - Possibly a secret policeman and possibly also a party member.\nMindalini (Mantalini) -  Sofya Petrovna's Italian lover.\nMatvei Morzhov - A yardkeeper.\nDmitrich Semyonych - The Ableukhovs' doorkeeper.\nIvan Ivanych Ivanov - A merchant.\nBessmertny - A shoe salesman.\nNeintelpfain - A hack journalist.\nStepan Styopka - A friend of Dudkin's.\nGrishka - a lackey in the Ableukov household.\nBely drew his characters from historical models: Apollon Apollonovich shares many characteristics with Procurator of the Holy Synod Konstantin Pobedonostsev, and Dudkin resembles the revolutionary terrorist Boris Savinkov.\nThere are many similarities with Joyce's Ulysses: the linguistic rhythms and wordplay, the Symbolism and subtle political concerns which structure the themes of the novel, the setting of the action in a capital city that is itself a character, the use of humor.  The differences are also notable: the English translation of Bely remains more accessible, his work is based on complex rhythm of patterns, and, according to scholarly opinion, does not use such a wide variety of innovations.  But these innovations, which subvert commonplace literary rhetoric, are necessary to conveying Petersburg at such a tumultuous time.\nThe comparison of Petersburg to Ulysses has been made for both its symbolist style and for the centrality of the city within the narrative. There are many allusions within the novel to the city's history going back to its founding by Peter the Great, and it incorporates a number of literary allusions to literature set in Petersburg (especially The Bronze Horseman) as well as Russian literature in general. The characters such as Apollon Apollonovich and Alexander Ivanovich often merge with their environments, while the city itself forms a significant role in the story's unfolding.\nThe book was informed by many of the philosophies Bely and others of"

Altered Carbon is a 2002 cyberpunk novel by the English writer Richard K. Morgan. Set in a future in which interstellar travel and relative immortality is facilitated by transferring consciousnesses between bodies (\"sleeves\"), it follows the attempt of Takeshi Kovacs, a former U.N. elite soldier turned private investigator, to investigate a rich man's death. It is followed by the sequels Broken Angels and Woken Furies.\nThe book was adapted as a Netflix television series, also titled Altered Carbon, in 2018. In 2019 a graphic novel was created with Dynamite Comics.\nIn the future, humans have achieved virtual immortality. Most people have cortical stacks in their spinal columns that store their consciousness. If their body dies, their stack can be stored indefinitely. Their stacks can be downloaded into new bodies, or \"sleeves\", after death. Roman Catholics do not allow their stacks to be re-sleeved after death, as they believe that the soul goes to Heaven when they die, and so would not pass on to the new sleeve. This makes Catholics easy targets for murder, since killers know their victim may not be re-sleeved to testify. At the start of the novel, UN Resolution 653 is being debated. This proposition reverses precedent and would allow authorities to temporarily re-sleeve a deceased Catholic woman to testify in a murder trial. Dual-sleeving, or controlling two bodies with one personality, is strictly prohibited by U.N. law.\nWhile most people can afford to get resleeved at the end of their lives, they are unable to update their bodies and most go through the full aging process each time, which discourages most from resleeving more than once or twice. Thus, while people can live indefinitely in theory, most choose not to. Only the wealthy are able to acquire replacement bodies on a continual basis. Those who have lived for multiple lifespans are called Meths, a reference to the Biblical figure Methuselah. The very rich are also able to keep copies of their minds in remote storage, which they update regularly. This ensures that even if their stack is destroyed, they can be re-sleeved. People who commit serious crimes are imprisoned \"on stack\". Their consciousness is preserved and stored virtually, sometimes for decades, while their body is sold to the highest bidder to be used for re-sleeving another person.\nNumerous colony planets exist apart from Earth; many were previously inhabited by an extinct alien civilization referred to as the Martians. In order to deal with the challenges of interspace warfare, the U.N. created the Envoys. They are an elite military group with extensive training in re-sleeving and psychological modification, as well as combat. Envoys are so successful and dangerous that they are generally prohibited from holding elected office on any world.\nDescribing the book, Kirkus Reviews said that \"The body count is high, the gadgetry pure genius, the sex scenes deliriously overwrought, and the worn cynicism thoroughly distasteful: a welcome return to cyberpunk's badass roots.\"\nThe book won the Philip K. Dick Award for Best Novel in 2003.\n\nA television adaptation was announced in 2016. An initial 10-episode season had been ordered by Netflix. The first season premiered on Netflix on 2 February 2018.\nExtensive and significant changes to the source material were made in the adaptation.\nIn the series Envoys are presented as having been trained, deployed and led by Quellcrist Falconer as part of a revolution (called \"the Uprising\") that she leads on Harlan\u2019s World (Kovacs' home planet). Kovacs is shown as having been trained as an Envoy by, and serving as a revolutionary under, Falconer. The Quellist Revolution is crushed by the Protectorate (the established, inter-planetary government) in an apocalyptic assault. Kovacs, the only survivor, is presented as the last Envoy.\nIn the books, Envoys were and are the elite forces of the Protectorate (which would have been fighting against the revolution); Falconer did lead a revolution but died long before Kovacs was born; Kovacs trained as an Envoy under a different woman; and the Envoy Corps is still very much in use by the Protectorate and remains widely feared, although Kovacs is no longer a member of Corps.\nThe makers of the show have also chosen to expand the roles of many characters, particularly female characters.\nIn the book, the hotel in which Kovacs stays while investigating Bancroft's murder is themed after Jimi Hendrix. Since the Hendrix estate does not approve of licensing his image for anything they consider violent, the"

The Legend of Huma is a fantasy novel by American writer Richard A. Knaak, the first in the Heroes Sextet of Dragonlance novels.  It was based on characters and settings from Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles series.  Published in 1988, it was the first Dragonlance book not dealing with the original companions.\nAuthor Richard Knaak wrote The Legend of Huma so that it followed the Dungeons & Dragons game rules. According to the Guide to Literary Masters & Their Works, \"Knaak's novel proved to be more successful than the game.\" The novel is a prequel to the original Dragonlance trilogy, Chronicles by Weis and Hickman, and is based on the legend mentioned in those books of the first person to discover the mythical Dragonlances. Knaak said that an overarching theme of his books is \"one should never give up.\"\nThis novel introduces the character of Kaz the minotaur. The novel builds on elements introduced in earlier short stories to treat minotaurs as characters rather than monsters.\nOn May 22, 1988, The Legend of Huma became a New York Times Best Seller.\nIn the Io9 series revisiting older Dungeons & Dragons novels, Rob Bricken commented that \"The Legend of Huma rolls an 8 on the ol' 1d20, although as I type that I wonder if I'm overvaluing it a little because the back half seemed so good compared to the first part.\"\nWeis, Margaret; Hickman, Tracy (November 1999). \"Book 2, chapter 10, Silvara's secret.\".

The two stories were combined under the title Tarzan the Magnificent in the first book edition, published in 1939 by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.

Dawn is a science fiction novel   by American writer Dean McLaughlin.  A re-imagining of Isaac Asimov's  1941 short story \"Nightfall\", it was serialized in Analog magazine (April\u2013July 1981), with two cover illustrations, for both its first and last segments.  The story was republished in hardcover in 2006.\nDawn is set on a world with six or seven \"gods\" \u2014 \"Blazing Alpher\", \"Red Bethe\", \"Actinic Gamow\", \"Bright Dalton\", \"Gold Ephron\", and \"Embrous Zwicky\"; and also \"The Pale One\", which is the largest but dimmest, and variable in color.  There is always at least one of the suns in the sky, so there is no place that experiences nightfall; the only truly dark places are in enclosed spaces such as caves or windowless rooms.\nThe passings of Alpher from east to west across the sky are the primary units of time, but longer periods are marked by the seasonal shift of Alpher north and south, and the overtaking of one god by another, and sand glasses are used for shorter periods.  With two important suns in the sky, the ability to predict their movements would be very valuable to predict conditions over future growing seasons.  Alas, while the priests can make useful short-term predictions, over the long term the gods seem to go where they will.  The world is a roughly medieval stage of development.  The priests of the Temple hold all political power.\nIsak is a young scribe with little formal training as a scholar, but he learned of the discovery that a pendulum can be used as a means of accurately measuring extended periods of time, such as from one rising of a sun to its next rising.  With this ability, and knowledge gained from his extensive travels about the world, Isak developed the ability to measure the various cycles of the suns, and a theory to explain them.  He has used his theory to calculate accurate, long-term foretellings of the movements of the gods, and has seemingly discovered an unprecedented event: a time will soon come when Gamow overtakes the Pale One and passes directly behind the Pale One so his light is blocked.  This will happen at a time when they are the only two in the sky, leaving the world below without sunlight.  The overtaking will last more than half a passing, long enough that the whole world will experience the darkness.\nIsak's world has no name, since its inhabitants haven't conceived that there could be anywhere else.  In fact, their world is a planet in a multiple-star system.  Within that system, the planet orbits around Alpher, a yellow star like Earth's sun.  Alpher and the smaller, cooler Bethe form a binary system, orbiting around each other but always separated by distances much greater than the orbit of the planet.  The Pale One is either a large moon or a double planet.  The other four stars are much farther away from Alpher than Bethe, and spread around Alpher so that evidently there is no place on the planet where all are below the horizon.  Gamow and Dalton each orbit by themselves, while Ephron and Zwicky are another binary system.  Gamow is well north of the equator, while Dalton and \"the Twinned Ones\" are well to the south.  The orbits of the moon and stars are sufficiently inclined that the inhabitants of the planet have seldom seen an eclipse or occultation.\nMcLaughlin pays homage to Asimov by naming the protagonist \"Isak\" and naming a historical figure Duke \"Lagash\", the name of the planet in \"Nightfall\".  While Asimov simply used the Greek letters Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc. to name the stars in his story, McLaughlin named his stars Alpher, Bethe, Gamow, Dalton, Ephron, and Zwicky.  The first three are an allusion to the famous Alpha-Beta-Gamma paper written in 1948 by Ralph Alpher and George Gamow with Hans Bethe.  Dalton and Zwicky are also famous scientists.\nSolar eclipses in fiction\nDawn title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database"

Dawn was a 1990 novel started by V. C. Andrews and finished by Andrew Neiderman after her death. It is the first of five books in the Cutler series.\nDawn Longchamp (AKA Eugenia Grace Cutler): The main character of the series. She is described as a bright girl with a gift in singing. She believed Ormand and Sally Jean to be her parents, but is really a member of the prestigious Cutler family. She has dreams of becoming a singer. Originally a shy and innocent girl, she becomes stronger and more assertive due to the events of the novel and the book ends with her flying to New York to study singing.\nJames \"Jimmy\" Longchamp: Dawn's adoptive older brother and the son of Ormand and Sally Jean, and older brother of Fern. He is described a hot-tempered and stubborn, but he does have a hidden softer side. He has loved Dawn ever since childhood, but never admitted this due to their upbringing as siblings.\nOrmand Longchamp: Husband of Sally Jean and father of Jimmy and Fern, adoptive father of Dawn. He is sent to jail for \"kidnapping\" Dawn for a short time, but is soon vindicated with Dawn's help\nSally Jean Longchamp: Wife of Ormand and mother of Jimmy and Fern. She is Dawn's confidant and loves all her children dearly. She dies of tuberculosis soon after Fern's birth.\nPhillip Cutler: The older brother of Dawn and Clara Sue, and son of Randolph and Laura Sue. He falls in love with Dawn and becomes obsessed with her even after learning they are brother and sister. Although he seems to be the one family member willing to help her, even helping Jimmy to come and see her after they are separated, his obsession and jealousy eventually lead him to rape her.\nClara Sue Cutler: The younger sister of Phillip and Dawn. At first she hates Dawn for being prettier and more talented, even though she is \"white trash\"; after the revelation that they are related, she hates her even more, because she has spent her whole life feeling like she is a replacement for the kidnapped \"Eugenia\". She is very rebellious and spoiled.\nLillian Cutler: The antagonist of the series. She is the grandmother of Dawn, Phillip, and Clara Sue, and mother of Randolph. After meeting her for the first time, Dawn thinks Lillian would have preferred her to be dead rather than brought back to the hotel. Lillian seems to deeply resent Dawn's presence, insisting that she work as a maid to prove she is not a 'thief' like her adoptive parents, and that Dawn answer to the name 'Eugenia' (the name of Lillian's beloved little sister, who died young). It is eventually revealed that Lillian was the one who arranged the kidnapping. She claims that this is because Dawn is the product of an affair between Laura Sue and a travelling musician, and she did not want Dawn growing up with the benefits of being a Cutler when she was actually 'a cuckoo in the nest'. She agrees to use her influence to get Ormand out of prison as long as Dawn will go to New York.\nRandolph Cutler: Father of Dawn, Phillip, and Clara Sue; husband of Laura Sue; son of Lillian and William. An old-fashioned 'mama's boy', but handsome and charming. Randolph is the only family member who seems happy to have Dawn back, but he is so dependent on Lillian that he cannot stand up to her about her treatment of Dawn. Eventually, Dawn finds out he is not her biological father, but his mother kept him in ignorance of this and her involvement in Dawn's \"kidnapping\" to protect him. As Dawn has become fond of Randolph, she never tells him the truth.\nLaura Sue Cutler: Mother of Dawn, Phillip, and Clara Sue; wife of Randolph. She is very beautiful, but refuses to take any responsibility for the hotel or even her children. She has little influence over her husband and Dawn ends up feeling like she is the adult in the relationship. When Dawn confronts her about being the product of an affair, she seems upset but does not disagree.\nWilliam Cutler: Husband of Lillian and father of Randolph. The original owner of Cutler Cove Hotel. He died prior to the story's beginning.\nMs. Mary Boston: Maid of the hotel. She becomes a close friend of Dawn's throughout the story.\nThe Complete V. C.

Gamow and Dalton each orbit by themselves, while Ephron and Zwicky are another binary system.  Gamow is well north of the equator, while Dalton and \"the Twinned Ones\" are well to the south.  The orbits of the moon and stars are sufficiently inclined that the inhabitants of the planet have seldom seen an eclipse or occultation.\nMcLaughlin pays homage to Asimov by naming the protagonist \"Isak\" and naming a historical figure Duke \"Lagash\", the name of the planet in \"Nightfall\".  While Asimov simply used the Greek letters Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc. to name the stars in his story, McLaughlin named his stars Alpher, Bethe, Gamow, Dalton, Ephron, and Zwicky.  The first three are an allusion to the famous Alpha-Beta-Gamma paper written in 1948 by Ralph Alpher and George Gamow with Hans Bethe.  Dalton and Zwicky are also famous scientists.\nSolar eclipses in fiction\nDawn title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database"

The forest in the beginning is divided into four territories for the  four Clans: ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan and ShadowClan. The forest is based on New Forest, which is in Southern England. Later, the Clans wander into the mountains in search of their new territory. There, they meet the Tribe of Rushing Water who give the Clans shelter and food. While with the Tribe, the Clans realize that the Tribe's spiritual ancestors are the Tribe of Endless Hunting, not StarClan: through this difference, the theme of religion is explored. After the Clans leave the Tribe, they arrive at the lake territory which the Clans decide will be their new home.\nBrambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, Crowpaw, Stormfur and Tawnypelt have returned to the Clans from a quest with a message from Midnight, the badger: the Clans must move to a new home, or risk death. The destruction of the forest has already begun, with the Clans starving as the food supply has been cut off and their habitat destroyed by the humans building a new road. At the same time, cats are being taken away by humans, including a ThunderClan apprentice, Leafpaw. A patrol is sent to rescue the captured cats, but Graystripe is captured after he succeeds in rescuing Leafpaw and other cats from RiverClan and WindClan, as well as many non-Clan cats.\nIt is difficult for Firestar, ThunderClan's leader, to convince ShadowClan and RiverClan to leave. Finally, RiverClan decides to leave when their river becomes poisoned by humans. ShadowClan also agrees to leave when a tree cut down by humans falls in their camp. While trying help ShadowClan, Firestar loses his second life when a tree falls on him. Midnight, an intelligent badger from the previous book, had told the questing cats that a dying warrior will show the Clans the way to their new home. The dying warrior turns out to be the spirit of Mudfur, the former RiverClan medicine cat. Mudfur runs through the night sky as a shooting star and drops behind the mountains, telling the Clans that their new territory will be beyond Highstones. The Clans travel together through the mountains, guided by Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, Crowpaw, Tawnypelt, and Stormfur.\nWhile in the mountains, the Clans meet the Tribe of Rushing Water, and Stormfur chooses to stay with the Tribe with Brook Where Small Fish Swim, whom he has fallen in love with, and his sister, Feathertail's, spirit. Near the end of the book, Squirrelpaw confesses her love to Brambleclaw and he confesses that he loves her back. At the end of the book, the Clans discover a forest around a lake that reflects all of the stars. This was the place where StarClan had sent them.\nThe book was first published as a hardcover on 27 December 2005 in the US. The e-book version was released about a year later on 6 November 2007 and the paperback version was released on 14 November 2006. In the UK, the hardcover was released on 1 January 2006, a few days after the US version came out. The paperback version was released eleven months later on 1 December 2006. The Canadian version was released by Tween Publishing on 2 November 2006. Dawn was released as a hardcover in Australia at the same time as America on 27 December 2005. Similarly, the paperback and e-book version were released on the same day as the US, 14 November 2006 for the paperback and 6 November 2007 for the e-book. The Chinese version of Dawn was released on 30 March 2009 with a slightly different cover. 3-D cards featuring Leafpaw were packaged inside the books.\nThemes in Dawn include religion, conflicting loyalty, and cooperation. A reviewer from Children's Literature wrote that it \"shows how difficult it can be for four separate and sometimes hostile groups to work together for a common goal, but also shows the rewards of that cooperation\". This refers to how all four Clans, who used to fight each other for food, must suddenly help each other for a common goal. Religion and loyalty are explored when the Clans meet the Tribe of Rushing Water, and Stormfur is torn between the Clans and Brook where Small Fish Swim, as well as when the Clans realize that Tribe cats believe in the Tribe of Endless Hunting and not StarClan. The religion issue causes the Clan and Tribe to be slightly distrustful of each other because they do not understand each other. Series"

The book starts out in Paris with Elisha, the main character, trying to start over from his childhood at Buchenwald Concentration Camp. A man named Gad stops over at Elisha\u2019s house to ask if he will give him his future. Gad wants him to join the Movement. Elisha agrees and moves to Palestine to help fight with the Movement.\nThe Movement is a group of terrorists made up of Jews who are fighting the British for control over Palestine. Elisha is sent to a training camp for six weeks to learn how to be a freedom fighter. After Elisha is trained, he is sent out on missions to kill the British in large quantities. Everyone within the Movement goes on separate assignments. While on one mission, a \u201cbrother\u201d named David ben Moshe was injured and captured.\nThe British took David ben Moshe as a prisoner of war and sentenced him to be executed at dawn. In retaliation, the Movement took hostage a British captain named John Dawson. The Movement threatened that if David Ben Moshe is executed, then they will kill John Dawson. However, if the British were to let Moshe go, then the people of the Movement would let Dawson go as well. The Old Man, the leader of the Movement, ordered Elisha to execute John Dawson at dawn if David ben Moshe was put to death.\nJohn Dawson is kept in a house with a jail in the basement. Elisha and a group of \u201cbrothers\u201d from the Movement, sat and waited for the confirmation that Moshe was to be hanged. The radio confirmed that night the execution of David Ben Moshe is to happen at dawn. When the announcement was finished, \u201cThe Voice of Freedom\u201d came on. This underground station is used by the Movement to get information out to the people. The \u201cVoice of Freedom\u201d is a woman named Ilana, who happens to be in love with Gad. Later in the night when the broadcast is finished, Ilana came to the house where John Dawson was being kept. The group of people at the house were sitting and talking about how they have escaped death and about Dawson\u2019s execution.\nAs the talking continued they decide that Dawson may be hungry. However, Elisha says he is not, asking how can a man be hungry when he knows he is about to die. Gad still takes a plate of food to Dawson and he ends up eating it all. While Elisha is waiting for Gad to return, he saw the poltergeists of people from his past. For example, a younger version of himself, his parents, the beggar, and his master, who is a Rabbi. The beggar is a man that taught him how to see the night and that Elisha thinks is a prophet, and the master is someone that Elisha looked up to as a role model. At this moment, Elisha was having an internal battle within himself about killing John Dawson and whether or not he wanted to go see him. When Gad comes back up from feeding Dawson and tells Elisha that he ate it all, Elisha is so shocked and confused that he decided that he is going to talk to him before he is to kill him, as he did not want to kill a complete stranger. Elisha wants to talk to Dawson by himself; Gad walked over to Elisha and handed him a sleek black revolver to take with him.\nWhen Elisha sees Dawson, he is surprised by how tall he appeared to be and how handsome he is. The only thing he knew about John Dawson was that he is going to die; the first thing John Dawson said to Elisha \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d (206). Elisha knew what he was talking about right away and answered that it is not yet, only around four-something in the morning. Then, Dawson asked for Elisha\u2019s name, and Elisha asked for a funny story. Dawson did not give one, but he did talk about his son. Before he was to be executed, he asked for a piece of paper from Elisha and wrote a letter to his son. Elisha said he would put it in the post that day. As the time came for Dawson to die, he tried to tell his funny story, but it was too late at that point. Elisha shot as Dawson was saying his name. Once his job was done, Elisha walked back upstairs, knowing he was a changed man.\nDavid B Moshe \u2013 David B Moshe was part of the Zionist Movement. He was captured by the Englishmen. He was sentenced to hanging by the Englishmen for being part of the Movement.\nJohn Dawson \u2013 John Dawson was an English army officer. He was caught for reprisal by the Zionist Movement. He was then held hostage by the Movement and was to be executed by Elisha. Elisha ends up shooting Dawson.\nJoab \u2013 Joab is part of the Zionist movement. He flees to an insane asylum to hide from his neighbor, who is against the Movement. Joab pretends to be sick so the police won\u2019t take him, but they take him anyway.\nGideon \u2013 Gideon was part of the Zionist Movement. He is a very religious person.

Dawn is set on a world with six or seven \"gods\" \u2014 \"Blazing Alpher\", \"Red Bethe\", \"Actinic Gamow\", \"Bright Dalton\", \"Gold Ephron\", and \"Embrous Zwicky\"; and also \"The Pale One\", which is the largest but dimmest, and variable in color.  There is always at least one of the suns in the sky, so there is no place that experiences nightfall; the only truly dark places are in enclosed spaces such as caves or windowless rooms.\nThe passings of Alpher from east to west across the sky are the primary units of time, but longer periods are marked by the seasonal shift of Alpher north and south, and the overtaking of one god by another, and sand glasses are used for shorter periods.  With two important suns in the sky, the ability to predict their movements would be very valuable to predict conditions over future growing seasons.  Alas, while the priests can make useful short-term predictions, over the long term the gods seem to go where they will.  The world is a roughly medieval stage of development.  The priests of the Temple hold all political power.\nIsak is a young scribe with little formal training as a scholar, but he learned of the discovery that a pendulum can be used as a means of accurately measuring extended periods of time, such as from one rising of a sun to its next rising.  With this ability, and knowledge gained from his extensive travels about the world, Isak developed the ability to measure the various cycles of the suns, and a theory to explain them.  He has used his theory to calculate accurate, long-term foretellings of the movements of the gods, and has seemingly discovered an unprecedented event: a time will soon come when Gamow overtakes the Pale One and passes directly behind the Pale One so his light is blocked.  This will happen at a time when they are the only two in the sky, leaving the world below without sunlight.  The overtaking will last more than half a passing, long enough that the whole world will experience the darkness.\nIsak has attempted to explain his foretelling to the priests of the Temple of Center, so that people might be told what to expect, and not to panic when it does.  They are unwilling to accept such a bizarre idea.  Furthermore, while Isak is innocent of the political implications of the event he describes, the priests are not.  If the gods all turn their sight from the world, they must be angry with their representatives.\nIsak's world has no name, since its inhabitants haven't conceived that there could be anywhere else.  In fact, their world is a planet in a multiple-star system.  Within that system, the planet orbits around Alpher, a yellow star like Earth's sun.  Alpher and the smaller, cooler Bethe form a binary system, orbiting around each other but always separated by distances much greater than the orbit of the planet.  The Pale One is either a large moon or a double planet.  The other four stars are much farther away from Alpher than Bethe, and spread around Alpher so that evidently there is no place on the planet where all are below the horizon.  Gamow and Dalton each orbit by themselves, while Ephron and Zwicky are another binary system.  Gamow is well north of the equator, while Dalton and \"the Twinned Ones\" are well to the south.

Dawn was a 1990 novel started by V. C. Andrews and finished by Andrew Neiderman after her death. It is the first of five books in the Cutler series.\nDawn Longchamp (AKA Eugenia Grace Cutler): The main character of the series. She is described as a bright girl with a gift in singing. She believed Ormand and Sally Jean to be her parents, but is really a member of the prestigious Cutler family. She has dreams of becoming a singer. Originally a shy and innocent girl, she becomes stronger and more assertive due to the events of the novel and the book ends with her flying to New York to study singing.\nJames \"Jimmy\" Longchamp: Dawn's adoptive older brother and the son of Ormand and Sally Jean, and older brother of Fern. He is described a hot-tempered and stubborn, but he does have a hidden softer side. He has loved Dawn ever since childhood, but never admitted this due to their upbringing as siblings.\nOrmand Longchamp: Husband of Sally Jean and father of Jimmy and Fern, adoptive father of Dawn. He is sent to jail for \"kidnapping\" Dawn for a short time, but is soon vindicated with Dawn's help\nSally Jean Longchamp: Wife of Ormand and mother of Jimmy and Fern. She is Dawn's confidant and loves all her children dearly. She dies of tuberculosis soon after Fern's birth.\nPhillip Cutler: The older brother of Dawn and Clara Sue, and son of Randolph and Laura Sue. He falls in love with Dawn and becomes obsessed with her even after learning they are brother and sister. Although he seems to be the one family member willing to help her, even helping Jimmy to come and see her after they are separated, his obsession and jealousy eventually lead him to rape her.\nClara Sue Cutler: The younger sister of Phillip and Dawn. At first she hates Dawn for being prettier and more talented, even though she is \"white trash\"; after the revelation that they are related, she hates her even more, because she has spent her whole life feeling like she is a replacement for the kidnapped \"Eugenia\". She is very rebellious and spoiled.\nLillian Cutler: The antagonist of the series. She is the grandmother of Dawn, Phillip, and Clara Sue, and mother of Randolph. After meeting her for the first time, Dawn thinks Lillian would have preferred her to be dead rather than brought back to the hotel. Lillian seems to deeply resent Dawn's presence, insisting that she work as a maid to prove she is not a 'thief' like her adoptive parents, and that Dawn answer to the name 'Eugenia' (the name of Lillian's beloved little sister, who died young). It is eventually revealed that Lillian was the one who arranged the kidnapping. She claims that this is because Dawn is the product of an affair between Laura Sue and a travelling musician, and she did not want Dawn growing up with the benefits of being a Cutler when she was actually 'a cuckoo in the nest'. She agrees to use her influence to get Ormand out of prison as long as Dawn will go to New York.\nRandolph Cutler: Father of Dawn, Phillip, and Clara Sue; husband of Laura Sue; son of Lillian and William. An old-fashioned 'mama's boy', but handsome and charming. Randolph is the only family member who seems happy to have Dawn back, but he is so dependent on Lillian that he cannot stand up to her about her treatment of Dawn. Eventually, Dawn finds out he is not her biological father, but his mother kept him in ignorance of this and her involvement in Dawn's \"kidnapping\" to protect him. As Dawn has become fond of Randolph, she never tells him the truth.\nLaura Sue Cutler: Mother of Dawn, Phillip, and Clara Sue; wife of Randolph. She is very beautiful, but refuses to take any responsibility for the hotel or even her children. She has little influence over her husband and Dawn ends up feeling like she is the adult in the relationship. When Dawn confronts her about being the product of an affair, she seems upset but does not disagree.\nWilliam Cutler: Husband of Lillian and father of Randolph. The original owner of Cutler Cove Hotel. He died prior to the story's beginning.\nMs. Mary Boston: Maid of the hotel. She becomes a close friend of Dawn's throughout the story.\nThe Complete V. C.

The book starts out in Paris with Elisha, the main character, trying to start over from his childhood at Buchenwald Concentration Camp. A man named Gad stops over at Elisha\u2019s house to ask if he will give him his future. Gad wants him to join the Movement. Elisha agrees and moves to Palestine to help fight with the Movement.\nThe Movement is a group of terrorists made up of Jews who are fighting the British for control over Palestine. Elisha is sent to a training camp for six weeks to learn how to be a freedom fighter. After Elisha is trained, he is sent out on missions to kill the British in large quantities. Everyone within the Movement goes on separate assignments. While on one mission, a \u201cbrother\u201d named David ben Moshe was injured and captured.\nThe British took David ben Moshe as a prisoner of war and sentenced him to be executed at dawn. In retaliation, the Movement took hostage a British captain named John Dawson. The Movement threatened that if David Ben Moshe is executed, then they will kill John Dawson. However, if the British were to let Moshe go, then the people of the Movement would let Dawson go as well. The Old Man, the leader of the Movement, ordered Elisha to execute John Dawson at dawn if David ben Moshe was put to death.\nJohn Dawson is kept in a house with a jail in the basement. Elisha and a group of \u201cbrothers\u201d from the Movement, sat and waited for the confirmation that Moshe was to be hanged. The radio confirmed that night the execution of David Ben Moshe is to happen at dawn. When the announcement was finished, \u201cThe Voice of Freedom\u201d came on. This underground station is used by the Movement to get information out to the people. The \u201cVoice of Freedom\u201d is a woman named Ilana, who happens to be in love with Gad. Later in the night when the broadcast is finished, Ilana came to the house where John Dawson was being kept. The group of people at the house were sitting and talking about how they have escaped death and about Dawson\u2019s execution.\nAs the talking continued they decide that Dawson may be hungry. However, Elisha says he is not, asking how can a man be hungry when he knows he is about to die. Gad still takes a plate of food to Dawson and he ends up eating it all. While Elisha is waiting for Gad to return, he saw the poltergeists of people from his past. For example, a younger version of himself, his parents, the beggar, and his master, who is a Rabbi. The beggar is a man that taught him how to see the night and that Elisha thinks is a prophet, and the master is someone that Elisha looked up to as a role model. At this moment, Elisha was having an internal battle within himself about killing John Dawson and whether or not he wanted to go see him. When Gad comes back up from feeding Dawson and tells Elisha that he ate it all, Elisha is so shocked and confused that he decided that he is going to talk to him before he is to kill him, as he did not want to kill a complete stranger. Elisha wants to talk to Dawson by himself; Gad walked over to Elisha and handed him a sleek black revolver to take with him.\nWhen Elisha sees Dawson, he is surprised by how tall he appeared to be and how handsome he is. The only thing he knew about John Dawson was that he is going to die; the first thing John Dawson said to Elisha \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d (206). Elisha knew what he was talking about right away and answered that it is not yet, only around four-something in the morning. Then, Dawson asked for Elisha\u2019s name, and Elisha asked for a funny story. Dawson did not give one, but he did talk about his son. Before he was to be executed, he asked for a piece of paper from Elisha and wrote a letter to his son. Elisha said he would put it in the post that day. As the time came for Dawson to die, he tried to tell his funny story, but it was too late at that point. Elisha shot as Dawson was saying his name. Once his job was done, Elisha walked back upstairs, knowing he was a changed man.\nDavid B Moshe \u2013 David B Moshe was part of the Zionist Movement. He was captured by the Englishmen. He was sentenced to hanging by the Englishmen for being part of the Movement.\nJohn Dawson \u2013 John Dawson was an English army officer. He was caught for reprisal by the Zionist Movement. He was then held hostage by the Movement and was to be executed by Elisha. Elisha ends up shooting Dawson.\nJoab \u2013 Joab is part of the Zionist movement. He flees to an insane asylum to hide from his neighbor, who is against the Movement. Joab pretends to be sick so the police won\u2019t take him, but they take him anyway.\nGideon \u2013 Gideon was part of the Zionist Movement. He is a very religious person.

The forest in the beginning is divided into four territories for the  four Clans: ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan and ShadowClan. The forest is based on New Forest, which is in Southern England. Later, the Clans wander into the mountains in search of their new territory. There, they meet the Tribe of Rushing Water who give the Clans shelter and food. While with the Tribe, the Clans realize that the Tribe's spiritual ancestors are the Tribe of Endless Hunting, not StarClan: through this difference, the theme of religion is explored. After the Clans leave the Tribe, they arrive at the lake territory which the Clans decide will be their new home.\nBrambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, Crowpaw, Stormfur and Tawnypelt have returned to the Clans from a quest with a message from Midnight, the badger: the Clans must move to a new home, or risk death. The destruction of the forest has already begun, with the Clans starving as the food supply has been cut off and their habitat destroyed by the humans building a new road. At the same time, cats are being taken away by humans, including a ThunderClan apprentice, Leafpaw. A patrol is sent to rescue the captured cats, but Graystripe is captured after he succeeds in rescuing Leafpaw and other cats from RiverClan and WindClan, as well as many non-Clan cats.\nIt is difficult for Firestar, ThunderClan's leader, to convince ShadowClan and RiverClan to leave. Finally, RiverClan decides to leave when their river becomes poisoned by humans. ShadowClan also agrees to leave when a tree cut down by humans falls in their camp. While trying help ShadowClan, Firestar loses his second life when a tree falls on him. Midnight, an intelligent badger from the previous book, had told the questing cats that a dying warrior will show the Clans the way to their new home. The dying warrior turns out to be the spirit of Mudfur, the former RiverClan medicine cat. Mudfur runs through the night sky as a shooting star and drops behind the mountains, telling the Clans that their new territory will be beyond Highstones. The Clans travel together through the mountains, guided by Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, Crowpaw, Tawnypelt, and Stormfur.\nWhile in the mountains, the Clans meet the Tribe of Rushing Water, and Stormfur chooses to stay with the Tribe with Brook Where Small Fish Swim, whom he has fallen in love with, and his sister, Feathertail's, spirit. Near the end of the book, Squirrelpaw confesses her love to Brambleclaw and he confesses that he loves her back. At the end of the book, the Clans discover a forest around a lake that reflects all of the stars. This was the place where StarClan had sent them.\nThe book was first published as a hardcover on 27 December 2005 in the US. The e-book version was released about a year later on 6 November 2007 and the paperback version was released on 14 November 2006. In the UK, the hardcover was released on 1 January 2006, a few days after the US version came out. The paperback version was released eleven months later on 1 December 2006. The Canadian version was released by Tween Publishing on 2 November 2006. Dawn was released as a hardcover in Australia at the same time as America on 27 December 2005. Similarly, the paperback and e-book version were released on the same day as the US, 14 November 2006 for the paperback and 6 November 2007 for the e-book. The Chinese version of Dawn was released on 30 March 2009 with a slightly different cover. 3-D cards featuring Leafpaw were packaged inside the books.\nThemes in Dawn include religion, conflicting loyalty, and cooperation. A reviewer from Children's Literature wrote that it \"shows how difficult it can be for four separate and sometimes hostile groups to work together for a common goal, but also shows the rewards of that cooperation\". This refers to how all four Clans, who used to fight each other for food, must suddenly help each other for a common goal. Religion and loyalty are explored when the Clans meet the Tribe of Rushing Water, and Stormfur is torn between the Clans and Brook where Small Fish Swim, as well as when the Clans realize that Tribe cats believe in the Tribe of Endless Hunting and not StarClan. The religion issue causes the Clan and Tribe to be slightly distrustful of each other because they do not understand each other. Series"

American Empire: The Center Cannot Hold is the second book in the American Empire alternate history series by Harry Turtledove. It takes place during the period of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression (specifically from 1924 to March 4, 1934). During this era in Turtledove's Southern Victory world, the Confederate States of America, stretching from Sonora to Virginia, is led by Whigs (with the fascist Freedom Party gaining more and more power) while the United States of America (which has been occupying Canada, Newfoundland, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the Sandwich Islands) is controlled by Socialists.\nThe title is derived from the apocalyptic vision appearing in Yeats' poem The Second Coming: \"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, / The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere / The ceremony of innocence is drowned; / The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.\"\nAmerican empire--the center cannot hold. Random House, Inc. 2002. ISBN\u00a0978-0-345-44421-9.\nRoland Green in his review for Booklist described this novel as \"another harrowing and literate installment in Turtledove's standard-setting alternate history\".

Their mobile \"barrel\" (tank) offensive proves decisive, as weak Confederate lines are unable to resist General George Armstrong Custer's advance towards Nashville, Tennessee.

In The New York Times Jonathan Ames wrote, \"'Bad Monkeys,' allusions aside, is highly entertaining. It moves fast and keeps surprising you.\" The Los Angeles Times criticized the book's characters, conversation, and recycled ideas, ultimately concluding that while Ruff \"does show flashes of the philosophical underpinnings found in his previous work\", that \"his talents are better suited to expansive worlds rather than this embedded chicanery\". The Washington Post'' compared the book to the G. K.

Sand Monkeys is a young adult novel by the Australian writer Joanne Horniman, who is known for novels centering on realistic depictions of people in unusual relationships.  It was published in 1992 by Omnibus Books.  The author's work on the novel was assisted by a writer's grant from the Australia Council.  It received a Notable Book designation by the Children's Book Council of Australia.\nSand Monkeys follows a period in the life a sixteen-year-old boy named Max, upon moving into a new household in Petersham, an inner suburb of Sydney Australia.  The narrative is framed by a series of letters which Max writes to his friend Socrates, in which Max describes his feelings about the events in the story.\nLike Joanne Horniman's other works, The Serpentine Belt (1994) and Loving Athena (1997), Sand Monkeys features the theme of the search for a lost parent, as well as the forging of strong bonds between characters who are not related by blood.\nIn common with Joanne Horniman's other books, Sand Monkeys concerns people's interaction with the natural world - in this case, with the trees that Max raises and plants. She writes that this is \"\u2026not in the usual adventurous sense but in a more spiritual way. We are all connected with forces that we are only aware of some of the time\u2026\" \nAuthor Joanne Horniman is involved with preserving the native Australian flora of her region in New South Wales, collecting and planting native plant seeds.\nIn the novel, the main character Max reflects this concern in his project of raising native plants from seed, and planting them around his neighbourhood.\nThe title of the book comes from a notation on the back of Emma's photo, which shows Max and \nEmma as small children playing in a sand pit.  In the notation, Max's mother refers to Max and Emma as \"...our two little sand monkeys\"\nChildren's Book Council of Australia (CBCA) Notable Book designation\nLisa Kumer (2006). \"Horniman, Joanne 1951-\".

The story is set in Portland, Maine, in 2091. Civilization is concentrated in the cities that escaped the severe bombings decades earlier. Travel between the cities is highly restricted. Electric fences separate the city from the Wilds, unregulated territory that was presumably mostly destroyed by bombs.\nThe totalitarian government teaches that love is a disease, Amor deliria Nervosa, commonly referred to as \"the deliria.\" A surgical cure for deliria has been developed and is mandatory for citizens at least 18 years old.  Lena is an orphan, living with her aunt, uncle, and two cousins. Lena has a sister, who is \"cured\" and married.\nLena's best friend, Hana, is prettier, more popular, and richer than Lena. Lena is obedient, stays home after curfew, and listens to music that is approved by the DFA, but Hana is rebellious, goes to underground parties after curfew, and listens to music that is banned by the DFA.\nHowever, only months before her scheduled procedure, Lena falls in love with an Invalid (a person who has not taken the Cure and lives in the Wilds), Alex. He was born in the Wilds outside the city and pretends to be cured to live undetected in the city and to partake in the resistance. He offers Lena the means of escape from the procedure that will destroy her ability to love.\nWhile trying to gain Lena's love, he finds out about her past life and family. When she mentions her \"dead\" mother and how she always kept a specific necklace with her, he knew who she is.\nAlex wants to show Lena that her mother was alive. He brings her to the Crypts, where people who do not obey the rules stay, to show her that her mother is still alive. When they find her mother's room, they find it empty, with a life-size hole in the wall where the letter 'O' is in the word LOVE.\nEver since Lena thinks that her whole childhood was a lie and wants to leave the city and go to the Wilds. While Lena and Alex try to escape to the Wilds, the government finds them. Alex tells Lena to not look back and that he will be right there with her, but then she does and realizes that he never moved. She keeps running into the Wilds, where she joins the resistance, leaving Alex to presumably die.\nLauren Oliver says that the inspiration for Delirium came to her one day at the gym. She had recently read a Gabriel Garcia M\u00e1rquez essay that stated all books were about either love or death. Since her first book, Before I Fall, was about death, she wanted to write a book about love. At the gym, she was watching a news report about a pandemic, and the two ideas combined in her head to form the central concept of the Delirium books.\nDelirium is the first installment of a trilogy. Two books set between the first and second books, Hana and Annabel, were released on February 28 and December 26, 2012 respectively. The second book, Pandemonium, was released on February 28, 2012. The third and final book in the trilogy, Requiem, was released on March 5, 2013. Another book, set between the second and third books of the trilogy, Raven, was also released March 5, 2013. total of 6 books.\nThe intermediate books were compiled into one book, Delirium Stories subtitled Hana, Annabel, and Raven, released the same date. Alex, also between the first and second books, was released with the first edition of the final book in the trilogy, Requiem.\nFox ordered a television pilot based on Delirium. According to The Hollywood Reporter actress Emma Roberts was cast as Lena Haloway, the main role. In February 2013, Gregg Sulkin was cast as the role of Julian Fineman, one of Lena's love interests, but was changed to be the love interest of her best friend Hana Tate for the show. On February 25, 2013 Daren Kagasoff was cast as Alex Sheathes, the male lead and Lena's love interest. Karyn Usher penned the pilot, with Peter Chernin and Katherine Pope as executive producers. On March 1, 2013, Jeanine Mason was cast as Hana Tate. Fox later declined to pick up the pilot.\nThe pilot episode was picked up by Hulu and was available to stream for a limited time beginning on June 20, 2014.\nDelirium was a New York Times bestseller. It was released to largely positive reviews, including starred reviews from Kirkus Reviews and the School Library Journal. NPR wrote, \"Oliver writes beautifully, with well-measured mastery.

Rob Roy (1817) is a historical novel by Walter Scott, one of the Waverley novels. It is probably set in 1715, the year of the first Jacobite uprising, and the social and economic background to that event are an important element in the novel, though it is not treated directly. The depiction of Rob Roy bears little relation to the historical figure: 'there are two Rob Roys. One lived and breathed. The other is a good story, a lively tale set in the past. Both may be accepted as \"valid\", but they serve different needs and interests.'\nFrank Osbaldistone narrates the story. He is the son of an English merchant who parted from his family home in the north of England near the border with Scotland when he was a young man, being of different religion and temperament than his own father or his younger brother. Frank is sent by his father to live at the long unseen family home with his uncle and his male cousins, when he refuses to join his father's successful business. In exchange, his father accepts Frank's cousin Rashleigh to work in his business. Rashleigh is an intelligent young man, but he is unscrupulous, and he causes problems for the business of Osbaldistone and Tresham. To resolve the problems, Frank travels into Scotland and meets the larger-than-life title character, Rob Roy MacGregor.\nJohn Ballantyne, Scott's literary agent, drew up a contract for Rob Roy on 5 May 1817 with Archibald Constable and Longman who had published the first three Waverley novels, the author having lost confidence in the publishers of his most recent fictional work Tales of my Landlord, John Murray and William Blackwood, who had turned out to be insufficiently committed to that project. Scott seems to have begun writing the novel immediately, but it was not completed until late December, partly because of illness.\nThe Rob Roy of Scott's novel is largely fictitious, with an input from stories he had heard, handed down over the generations. As is his wont he adjusts historical chronology freely for his narrative purposes. A number of printed sources were valuable for different components of the work. Thus, for business matters he used The Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce by Malachy Postlethwayt, of which he owned the third edition published in 1766. The depiction of Justice Inglewood and his clerk draws directly on The Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer by Richard Burn, the 13th edition of 1776 being in Scott's library. And Bailie Jarvie was suggested by another book he owned, The Highland Rogue: or, the Memorable Actions Of the Celebrated Robert Mac-gregor, Commonly called Rob-Roy [by Elias Brockett] (1723).\nThe first edition, in three volumes, dated 1818, was published in Edinburgh on 30 December 1817 by Archibald Constable and Co. and in London on 13 January 1818 by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. The print run was 10,000 and the price \u00a31 4s. Scott was involved in only two of the subsequent editions of the novel. In 1823 he made significant changes to the text for the 18mo Novels and Tales, though that was essentially a textual dead end. At the end of 1828 he revised the text, somewhat sporadically, for the 'Magnum' edition and provided notes and a very long introduction: it appeared as Volumes 7 and 8 in December 1829 and January 1830. \nThe standard modern edition, by David Hewitt, was published as Volume 5 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 2008: this is based on the first edition with emendations principally from Scott's manuscript; the new Magnum material is included in Volume 25a.\nWilliam Osbaldistone, of the firm of Osbaldistone and Tresham\nFrank, his son\nMr Owen, his head clerk\nMorris, a government agent\nAndrew Fairservice, Frank's servant\nSir Frederick Vernon, a Jacobite\nDiana (Die) Vernon, his daughter\nSir Hildebrand Osbaldistone, her maternal uncle\nArchie, Perceval, Thorncliff, John, Dick, and Wilfred, six of his sons\nRashleigh, his youngest son\nAnthony Syddall, his butler\nSquire Inglewood, a Justice of the Peace\nJoseph Jobson, his clerk\nDougal Gregor, jailor at the Glasgow tolbooth\nBailie Nicol Jarvie, a Glasgow merchant\nJean MacAlpine, landlady of the inn at Aberfoil\nMajor Duncan Galbraith of Garschattin\nAllan Stuart of Iverach, and Inverashalloch, two Highlanders\nCaptain Thornton, an English officer\nRob Roy MacGregor (Campbell)\nHelen, his wife\nRobert and Hamish, their sons\nVolume One\nCh. 1: Frank Osbaldistone (the first-person narrator) is summoned home"

Set in an unspecified \"near-future\" (one of the main characters has childhood memories of the Exxon Valdez disaster) in which a radical left-wing environmentalist movement has joined forces with the religious right through a shared distaste for modern technology. The resulting bipartisan conspiracy has gained control of the US government and imposed draconian luddite laws which, in attempts to curb global warming, have ironically brought about the greatest environmental catastrophe in recorded history \u2013 an ice age which may eventually escalate into a Snowball Earth.\nThe exact process is described: clouds are water condensation. This cannot occur without cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. The emission laws have removed most of this, reducing cloud cover, meaning the ground loses heat faster. This in combination with the drop in greenhouse gases has resulted in the return and exacerbation of the Little Ice Age; now self-perpetuating as glaciers have a much higher albedo.\nAs a radical totalitarian environmentalist party now controls the US government, the scientific explanation is denounced as \"propaganda from life-hating technophiles\", and blame for the ice age is instead solely placed on the society surviving in orbit. Science fiction fandom forms the core of a pro-technology underground in the United States, working in tandem with hacker movements.  Other technologists \u2013 accused by the government of pursuing \"materialist science\" \u2013 were removed from their jobs and forced underground, where they were generally unable to continue their work. This rabid distaste for technology has resulted in the collapse of the economy and lack of education and a complicit media has left the majority of the population credulous and easily manipulated. The Greens have been in power for most of the lives of the characters.\nAs glaciers rapidly advance south, Canada and the northern United States are all but destroyed. Near the edge of the glaciers, in  Milwaukee, barbaric feudal systems arise as the federal government and markets collapse, leaving violence and disease in their wake. In orbit, Mir and Space Station Freedom survive in tandem with a Lunar colony, but with no support from Earth. The city of Winnipeg is the last major outpost of Canadian civilization, warmed and inhabitable due to immense amounts of solar power beamed from the space stations.\nAstronauts from the orbital society fly a modified scramjet, redesigned to harvest nitrogen from the Earth's atmosphere. Government policy declares that these ships are responsible for the ice age, so the scramjet is shot down with a surface-to-air missile. The pilot and copilot, an Earth-born American named Alex MacLeod and a space-born Russo-American named Gordon Tanner, are forced to crash land in Canada atop the glaciers.\nUpon hearing of this, the fan underground embarks on a rescue mission \u2013 a group of fans rides north through the Dakotas to rescue the astronauts before they can be apprehended by the Government. Upon reaching the Dakotas, the fans must travel largely on foot, as their van is unable to traverse the glaciers. However, they have a major advantage over their foes in the government \u2013 their relationship with the space station provides them with superior navigational abilities; following the fall of scientific society, the United States Air Force (USAF) no longer enjoys access to satellite reconnaissance. The fans are able to reach the downed spacecraft well in advance of the USAF.\nTheir escape is aided in a similar manner. Though the Angels are unable to walk due to their overexposure to weightlessness and must be dragged along on sleds, the microwave power transmission beam reserved for Winnipeg is diverted to warm the travellers as they return south to their van. In addition, a tribe of nomadic Inuit peoples shares supplies with them in thanks for the warmth provided by the microwave beam.\nUpon finally reaching their van, the rescuers flee to a small science fiction convention of some 50 fans at a mansion owned by one of their own. Once there, one of the fans takes on the role of personal trainer to help the Angels adjust to Earth's gravity including various asanas from yoga.  At the con, the fans brainstorm a daring plan - before the Greens had come to power, one of the Board of Trustees for the Metropolitan Museum of Boston by the name of Ron Cole supposedly refurbished a Titan II rocket. This rocket still exists at the Museum of Science and Industry at Chicago. The fans and the Angels leave for Chicago just moments before the mansion is raided by the Green police.\nThe trip to"

Walter Dean Myers was born in West Virginia in 1937. Myers's mother died three years after his birth, and his father, too poor to raise him, put him into foster care. His foster parents lived in the African-American neighborhood of Harlem in New York City, and he spent most of his childhood and young adulthood there. Though Myers describes his young life as happy\u2014filled with basketball games, a loving upbringing, and good books\u2014he suffered from a speech impediment that made it difficult for him to communicate with others, and at first filled him with rage. Unable to reach out verbally, Myers turned to writing, pouring out his thoughts in poems and short stories. He spent hours in the public library, reading anything he could get his hands on. By the time Myers reached high school, he knew he had intellectual potential, but also knew that his family was too poor to send him to college. Discouraged, he dropped out of school at age fifteen, and though he was persuaded to return, he dropped out again at sixteen. In 1954, on his seventeenth birthday, he joined the army.\nUpon his release from the army, Myers had few job skills and little education, and he still suffered from his speech impediment. He took a job loading trucks and then worked in a number of odd jobs in places such as the New York State Department of Labor, a post office, and a rehabilitation center. Myers also kept writing throughout this time, submitting his work to various magazines and periodicals. In 1969, Myers's career received a boost when his novel Where Does a Day Go? won a contest sponsored by the Council on Interracial Books for Children. From that point on, Myers was able to support himself with his writing, turning out a large number of books for children and young adults.\nThe plot follows a soldier named Perry, through his experiences in Vietnam, at war, and through his life.\nThe novel initially received mixed reviews.\nThe book received the following accolades: \nSouth Carolina Book Award for Young Adult Book Award (1991)\nCharlotte Award (1992)\nKeystone to Reading Book Award (1994)\nCoretta Scott King Book Award for Author (1989)\nMargaret A. Edwards Award (1994)\nHowever, Fallen Angels inclusion of offensive language, racism, drugs, sexual content, and violence have made it a frequent target of censors; the novel appears on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-1999 (85), 2000-2009 (11), and 2010-2019 (5). It also appeared in the annual list of the top ten most commonly banned and challenged books in 2001 (9), 2003 (5), and 2004 (2).\nPublished twenty years later, Myers' book Sunrise Over Fallujah (Scholastic, 2008), which follows a young U.S. soldier's experience during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, is a sequel to Fallen Angels.\nFive years after that, Myers' book Invasion (Scholastic, 2013), is a prequel which covers D-Day during World War II.\nFallen Angels, Walter Dean Myers.

K. Hilyer, the vicar of Siddermoton, and then taken in and cared for at the vicarage.

M. Dent (UK), MacMillan and Co. (US). release_date: 1895. wikisource: The Wonderful Visit. The Wonderful Visit is an 1895 novel by H. G. Wells. With an angel\u2014a creature of fantasy unlike a religious angel\u2014as protagonist and taking place in contemporary England, the book could be classified as contemporary fantasy, although the genre was not recognised in Wells's time.  The Wonderful Visit also has strong satirical themes, gently mocking customs and institutions of Victorian England as well as idealistic rebellion itself.\nThe Wonderful Visit was inspired by John Ruskin's remark that an angel appearing on earth in Victorian England would be shot on sight.\nThe novel's publication date of September 1895 means that it must have been read by the public as a commentary on the notorious trial of Oscar Wilde, whose persecution had begun in February 1895 and who was imprisoned on 25 May 1895.\nWells dedicated the book to his friend Walter Low, who died of pneumonia in 1895.  Low had helped Wells get a foothold in the world of journalism in 1891 when both were working at the University Correspondence College.\nThe Wonderful Visit was published in the same year (1895) as Select Conversations with an Uncle, The Time Machine, and The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents; at this time Wells's published output was about 7,000 words a day.\nIn 1907 George Bernard Shaw discouraged Wells from thoughts he had long harboured of turning the book into a play; at least four attempts to dramatise the work\u2014some of them realised, some not\u2014seem to have been made, in 1896, 1900, 1921, and 1934.\nReviews were favourable, with one contemporary reviewer calling The Wonderful Visit \"a striking fantasia wrought with tact, charm and wit.\"\nJoseph Conrad, whom Wells met when he reviewed his early work favourably, admired The Wonderful Visit and wrote to him to praise his \"imagination so unbounded and so brilliant.\"\nFor biographer Michael Sherbourne, The Wonderful Visit \"presages the humour of Kurt Vonnegut.\"\nThe novel was adapted to film by Marcel Carn\u00e9 in 1973 as La Merveilleuse visite.  An operatic adaptation, La visita meravigliosa, by Nino Rota, premiered in 1970; an excerpt from the work was performed at Federico Fellini's funeral in 1993.\n\"HGWells\".

On the day that Jacky Faber is to wed her true love, Jaimy, she is kidnapped by British Naval Intelligence and forced to embark on yet another mission for the Crown, searching for sunken Spanish gold off the coast of Havana. Along the way, Jacky and her mates find more than they have bargained for.\nMinutes after the final confrontation at the end of My Bonny Light Horseman, Jacky\u2019s schooner, the Nancy B. Alsop, comes to receive Jacky from Paris. Once aboard, her butler Master John Higgins cleans her up and Jacky discusses her duty as a nightclub dancer, her position as spy for the British, and her relationship with Jean-Paul.\nJacky is  reunited with Jaimy, and the two decide to get married when at home in Britain. When in London, she reunites with friends and family and dines with Jaimy's family.\nOn the day of the wedding, Mairead, Judy, and Joannie help get Jacky ready, but the wedding is  interrupted by British Intelligence and Jackie and Jamie are taken away. Jacky is reunited with Mr. Peel and Lord Grenville, who inform Jacky of the assignment at hand. In 1733, the ship Santa Magdalena sunk while carrying millions of gold in coins. Britain wants to retrieve that gold to help the economy and Jacky is promised a percentage of that gold and a possible pardon from the King, despite her crimes of piracy.\nJacky and Jamie are given separate ships: the Dolphin and the Nancy B. Alsop. The Dolphin is commandeered by Captain Hannibal Hudson, while Jacky captains the Nancy B. Jaimy and Lieutenant Flashby are stationed on the Dolphin. Jacky is assigned to sail to the Florida Keys to the locationof the Santa Magdalena. Jackie and Jamie depart on their two separate ships and sail for Boston. In Spanish waters, Jacky is required to take up a disguise as an American sponge diver.\nJacky prepares to revisit the Lawson Peabody School for Young Girls. She sees her friend and biographer, Amy Trevelyne, who has recently taken a liking for Ezra Pickering.\nEventually, Jacky reunites with Captain Hudson and Jaimy. Hudson show Jacky a diving bell, which will aid Jacky underwater while she hunts for the Santa Magdalena gold supply.  Before setting sail for the Keys, Jacky tells Captain Hudson to be on the lookout for any ship-jumpers that might get on board for information and turn it in to the opposing forces such as the Spanish. Jacky and Jaimy enjoy time together but must depart for a couple of weeks.\nWhile docked in Charleston, Jacky, Davy, and Tink, visit a couple of taverns where Jacky performs songs on the pennywhistle and violin. The next day, Jacky and the group run into a slave auction. Jacky is deeply angered by this kind of trade, but bids for an old slave woman named Jemimah and brings her aboard her ship. Jemimah is taken in as the ship's cook.\nWhen they get to the Keys, Jacky starts swimming immediately; her first dive is a dangerous one as she has a run-in with a moray eel. Despite Dr. Sebastian's interest in the creature, Jacky decapitates the eel.\nWhile sailing around a nearby island, Jacky prepares  to dive and find the Santa Magdalena. Spurred on by Dr. Sebastian, Jacky dives into the water and finds the sunken ship. Unfortunately, a Spanish man-of-war called the San Cristobal comes across the Nancy B. and board it. The officer in charge demands who the fleet is and what's their purpose in Spanish waters. Unconvinced, the men scrounge the Nancy B., although they find no evidence to prove the crew are fakes. After Jacky emerges from the water and offends the officer in charge, the Spanish and the Nancy B. sail separately for Havana.\nOnce they dock, the lieutenant from the San Cristobal introduces himself as Juan Carlos Cisneros y Siquieros. Jacky and Juan Carlos instantly dislike each other. Meanwhile, Jemimah decides to explore the town and see if she likes it enough to make her own roots. Jacky, Davy, and Tink explore the town; taking in some cockfighting matches and  performing at the Cafe Americano, among other activities. Soon, Jemimah comes back to be a part of the crew.\nOne night at the Cafe Americano, Jacky runs into old flame Flaco Jimenez and is introduced to Flaco's new first mate, El Feo. As they talk, it is revealed that Captain Hudson let a ship-jumper on board the Dolphin, who gathered information for the Spanish. \nJaimy and the Dolphin crew soon meet up with Jacky, who has spent her time preparing for cockfighting matches. Jacky gets ready for her first descent using the diving bell; Tink makes Jacky some swim fins and she gets used to the diving bell's design. As they make preparations, Flaco Jimenez and"

Zoey and her friends help Stevie Rae heal after the events at the end of Untamed \u2013 the arrow did not kill her, but took most of her lifeblood, so Kalona could be freed from the earth. Zoey and Stevie Rae reconcile, and the latter introduces Zoey's group to some of the red vampyre fledglings. Aphrodite lets Stevie Rae feed on her to heal, which forms an Imprint between them. When Erik follows Zoey on her way to her room they kiss, but then Erik gets too rough and scares her. Erik and Zoey get back together, though Zoey's not entirely sure due to Erik's possessiveness. Kalona starts getting into Zoey's dreams to seduce her, and calls her A-ya.\nKramisha, a red fledgling, is revealed to also express prophecies through her poetry, and Zoey gives her the title of Poet Laureate. This is how they find their first clue. One of Kramisha's poems states that Kalona and Neferet will be banished when Night, Humanity, Blood, Spirit and Earth come together, but Zoey doesn't know who will represent these elements.\nHeath arrives at the tunnels, and Zoey goes outside to talk to him, much to Erik's anger. Heath tries to reconcile with her, but to no avail. A Raven Mocker attacks them and critically wounds Zoey. She drinks from Heath to heal and they Imprint again, but she is still weakened. Kramisha gets exited and loses her control a little when she sees Heath (a human), leading Zoey to realize that the red fledglings may still have problems with their self-control. Darius finally declares that Zoey needs exposure to more adult vampyres to survive, and she is forced to return to the House of Night, much to Neferet's pleasure. She finds out that Kalona's presence has caused the fledglings and the vampyres to turn their backs on Nyx. Kalona's favorite son, Rephaim, and Darius get into a fight. Kalona intercedes and gives Darius a huge scar which upsets Aphrodite.\nZoey successfully persuades Stark to turn back to the good side. He becomes the second red vampyre when he pledges his Warrior's Oath to Zoey and she accepts. Zoey discusses the situation with Lenobia and, upon analyzing Kramisha's poem again, finds out that she is Night, Blood is Stevie Rae, Humanity is Aphrodite, Sister Mary Angela is Spirit, and Grandma Redbird is Earth.\nZoey and her friends set fire to the school as a diversion and escape on horseback to the Benedictine Abbey. Zoey and the other people mentioned in the poem open a circle and send everyone else inside. Neferet, Kalona and Stark arrive quickly afterwards in an SUV, followed by the Raven Mockers. Neferet and Kalona take turns at threatening and cajoling Zoey but she finally accepts the truth: that although A-ya is a part of her, she will choose her own destiny. She rejects Kalona. Neferet orders Stark to shoot Zoey but he says that Zoey is his heart and aims at her while thinking of himself. Realizing what will happen, Zoey uses the elements to stop the arrow and knocks him out in the process. Night, Humanity, Blood, Spirit, and Earth complete the spell and banish Neferet and Kalona.

They gain entrance because of Stark's being the blood relative of Seoras, the queen's Guardian (the \"bridge of blood\"). Together with Sgiach they decipher the rest of the poem and realize that Stark must become a Shaman to step into the Otherworld.\nStark sacrifices on the altar of Seol ne Gigh and through pain he enters a trance where he kills the evil side of himself to become a Shaman. After the fight, the Black Bull leads him to the Otherworld.\nZoey meets Heath in the Otherworld and refuses to be parted from him a second time. As time passes she becomes more and more erratic. Heath feels bad as he sees her fall apart, but is powerless to stop it as Zoey herself is too afraid to accept the lost parts of her soul back.\nWhen Stark arrives, he follows Aphrodite's advice and contacts Heath first, as Zoey wouldn't leave with Heath still in the Otherworld with her. Stark argues that Zoey might still accept her soul back and stay with Heath, but Neferet would win in the real world. Realizing that Stark speaks the truth and is not motivated by jealousy anymore, Heath speaks one more time with Zoey and disappears.\nWhile Zoey stays behind, crying, Stark comes and tries to get Zoey to come back, but she is too scared. To get her to act, Stark comes out of the enchanted meadow and faces Kalona in an arena. Terrified that Stark might die too, Zoey finally calls back the fragments of her soul. Stark is temporarily distracted, and Kalona kills him. Zoey calls air and fixes him on the wall of the arena. She calls in the debt he owns her for Heath's death to save Stark, and Nyx materializes and forces Kalona to share some of his immortality with Stark before banishing him from her realm.\nAfter having nearly burned down on a roof, Stevie Rae recovers quickly due to Rephaim's Immortal blood and their Imprint. She learns of Zoey's soul shattering and has to balance the expectations of those who would expect her to step in Zoey's shoes. She escapes her friends to talk to Rephaim and the two make a pact to help each other until Zoey or Kalona returns to her or his body.\nStevie Rae follows the clues in Kramisha's poems and decides to invoke Light, materialized as one of the bulls. By wrongly presuming that Light will materialize as the white Bull, she accidentally invokes Darkness, who nonetheless gives Stark access to the Otherworld. To reach her in time, Rephaim calls unto the immortal powers of his father to heal his wing, without realizing that it's actually Darkness too, that answers. He reaches her in time and takes on her debt to Darkness, allowing the Bull to feed on his pain. To save him, Stevie Rae calls the black Bull, Light and accepts to be forever bound to Rephaim's humanity in exchange for Light's saving him. The Bulls start fighting and disappear. Dallas appears and takes a wounded Stevie Rae home.\nWhen she heals she takes the red fledglings to conquer the tunnels. On the way,  Dallas discovers an affinity for the New world, electricity, and leads them to the kitchens where the renegades are gathered. Five of them die in the ensuing confrontation, but none of Stevie Rae's, because of her Earth affinity and the others flee. Stevie Rae and Dallas remain behind to finish cleaning up. Dallas kisses Stevie Rae when Rephaim finds them, alerted by the Imprint. Realizing that Stevie Rae has saved and sheltered him, Dallas lets himself be influenced by the residual Darkness left by the renegades and fights him. When Stevie Rae protects Rephaim, Dallas accepts Darkness and Changes and angrily rushes out, threatening to tell everyone at the House of Night the truth. When she finds out he has stolen her car, Stevie Rae lets Rephaim fly her to Gilcrease, where she goes to sleep.\nThe next day, Stevie Rae calls Lenobia, to find that Dallas has never reached the House of Night, and Aphrodite, to learn that she has had a vision about her and Rephaim. Stevie Rae and Rephaim confess their feelings for each other and Nyx offers them a vision of a human Rephaim. As they look transfixed, Kalona returns to the real world, along with Zoey, and Rephaim leaves, confessing he can't turn his back on his father.\nZoey Redbird\nNyx\nStark\nStevie Rae\nNeferet\nHeath Luck\nAphrodite\nKalona\n \nSylvia Redbird \u2013 Zoey's grandmother\nErin Bates\nShaunee Cole\nDamien Maslin\nErik Night\nJack Twist \u2013 Damien's boyfriend\nRephaim \u2013 leader of the Raven Mockers\nDarius \u2013 A son"

                "description": "Ten Talents is a vegetarian and vegan cookbook originally published in 1968 by Rosalie Hurd and Frank J. Hurd. At the time, it was one of the few resources for vegetarian and vegan cooks. The cookbook promotes Christian vegetarianism and a Bible-based diet, in keeping with teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. By 1991, the 750-recipe cookbook was entering its 44th printing and had sold more than 250,000 copies. An expanded edition with more than 1,000 recipes was issued in 2012.",

Hurd. awards: Silver Medal at the 2009 Living Now Book Awards. genre: Cookbook. image: Cover_ten_talents_book.jpg. italic title: . language: English. name: Ten Talents. published: 1968. subject: Vegetarian and vegan cuisine. website: https://tentalents.net/. The title refers to a quote from Ellen White, a founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church: \"The one who understands the art of properly preparing food, and who uses this knowledge, is worthy of higher commendation than those engaged in any other line of work. This talent should be regarded as equal in value to ten talents\", which references the Parable of the Talents.\nThe 1968 edition consisted of 750 plant-based, whole food recipes for adults and infants, along with glossaries of natural ingredients, tables of equivalents, nutritional information charts, natural remedies, and an outline of the Seventh-Day Adventist \"prescription for health\", or Christian vegetarianism. The book promotes a diet based on the Bible, and the covers of the various editions all depict author Hurd reading from a Bible. \nNumerous recipes using soybean products such as soy pulp, soy milk powder, and soy flour are featured. According to Shurtleff and Aoyagi, Ten Talents is the first cookbook to feature recipes for soy milk ice cream shakes and the earliest to have a recipe for soy sour cream. Only one chapter includes recipes with animal products\u2014namely, milk and eggs\u2014\"for those who are in the transitional period\", the authors note.\nThe book published some of the first recipes for granola, familia and cashew milk. It used nutritional yeast and soy sauce for flavor. It relied heavily on loaves, fritters, and patties.\nThe cookbook was originally self-published in May 1968. It was updated in 1985; at that time it was published by College Press of Collegedale, Tennessee. In 1991, it was entering its 44th printing and had sold more than 250,000 copies. The cookbook was expanded in 2012 to encompass more than 1,000 recipes. In 2014 the cookbook was in its 48th printing. It has always been published in a spiral binding. Jonathan Kauffman, writing in Hippie Food (2018), said it sold hundreds of thousands of copies.\nIn 1971 the Santa Cruz Sentinel called the book \"one of the very few completely natural foods cookbooks\", and in 1977 the North American Vegetarian Society recommended the book as an encyclopedia of vegetarian cooking.\nIn 1994 Vegetarian Times named it to their list of \"Cookbooks You Can't Live Without\" as a runner-up to the category of \"Best Cookbooks for Beginners\", saying it had been one of the few resources for vegetarian cooks in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was still one of the best general references.\nThe 2004 Dietitian's Guide to Vegetarian Diets called it the classic Seventh-day Adventist cookbook. In 2017 Washington Post Food Editor Joe Yonan listed it as one of three \"must-have classic vegetarian cookbooks\". Vegan teacher and cookbook author Victoria Moran wrote that it was one of only two vegan cookbooks she had been able to find when she first started exploring veganism in the 1970s.\nIn 1976 Connie I. Dahlke, Chief Therapeutic Dietician at Boulder Memorial Hospital, sent a letter reviewing the book to the bookstore manager at the Colorado Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists in Denver; copies had been forwarded to hospital and university nutrition and home economics department heads and to the authors. The letter contained a 21-point negative review of the cookbook and asked that it be removed from sale. Among the criticisms were the book's preference for raw sugar and honey over brown sugar and refined white sugar; the claim that \"sunflower seeds, almonds and coconut are 'valuable sources' of Vitamin D... when in fact they contain no Vitamin D\"; and an assertion that \"monstrous statements about the ingredients of ice cream... and objections to meat eating... reveal emotionalism and poor judgment\". The authors reportedly responded to the criticisms by \"making many changes\" in the text before the next reprinting.\nA 1977 article in Canadian Adventist Messenger said that a review by dieticians, pharmacists, and physicians found the dietary and medical advice contained in the book was unsound and advised readers to view it with caution. A subsequent article in the same source said the book was being re-edited to clarify the information.\nThe cookbook won a Silver Medal in the Cooking/Natural category at the 2009 Living Now Book Awards.\nRosalie Hurd (b. April 1937) is a nutritionist and home economist. Frank Hurd (b. March 1936) is a doctor of chiropractic and medicine. They are Seventh-Day Adventists and proponents of Christian vegetarianism, and met at Atlantic Union College, a now-defunct Seventh-Day Adventist institution. At the time of the book's first publication they lived in Chisholm, Minnesota, and ran a health-food store and sold a breakfast cereal called \"Get Up and Go\". As of 2014 they lived in"

The Minor Adjustment Beauty Salon is the fourteenth mystery novel by Alexander McCall Smith in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, first published in 2013. The novel features the Motswana protagonist Precious Ramotswe and is set in Botswana.\nMma Ramotswe has two cases on hand, one to verify the identity of a boy as the heir to a large farm and the other to stop the smear campaign against the owner of the Minor Adjustment Beauty Salon, as it has stopped all customers from coming to her shop. Grace Makutsi is pregnant, but does not bring up the fact until late in her pregnancy, nor does she ever bring up the plan for her maternity leave. This gives Mma Ramotswe much to consider while her secretary and assistant is away with the baby. Mr JLB Matekoni contemplates whether he is a modern husband.\nThis novel drew a range of reactions from reviewers. Some viewed it positively, termed it \"endearing\", and considered the novel to have its strength in the characters and their love of Africa, rather than the deductions needed to solve the mysteries. By contrast, one reviewer considers this novel to show the reasons for the longevity of the series, with its sweet aspects but not omitting the harsh facts of life; \"Forgiveness and generosity . . . are the answer to most of life\u2019s ills\", concludes Mma Ramotswe. The changes Mma Ramotswe must make in response to the changes life brings her, were the focus for another reviewer. Yet another reviewer focussed on some hilarious scenes in this novel and the close relationship between Mma Ramotswe and her husband.\nThe hardcover novel opened at number 5 on the New York Times Best Sellers in November 2013, and was on the NPR Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list for four weeks at the end of 2013.\nMma Precious Ramotswe: She is the owner of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Gaborone, Botswana, who is now in her 40s. She is self-taught as a detective, and generally successful in resolving the cases brought to her. In her youth, she married a musician who was cruel to her. She had a baby who died soon after birth, and learned she could have no more children. She is married to Mr JLB Matekoni. She drives a tiny white van which she bought back after briefly using a newer van. She is a woman of \"traditional build\" and one who values the traditions of her people even as her country changes so much.\nObed Ramotswe: Late father of Precious, who was a strong and wise man. She loves him dearly and often thinks of him.\nMr JLB Matekoni: Owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors garage, and possibly the best mechanic in Botswana. He is the husband of Mma Ramotswe. He is a good man.\nMotholeli: One of two foster children being raised by Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and Mma Ramotswe. Due to early health problems she moves about in a wheelchair.

He and his sister are of the Basarwa people of Gaborone, hunter-gatherers who live in the bush. He was introduced in Tears of the Giraffe.\nMma Grace Makutsi: She is the secretary to Mma Ramotswe and an associate detective. She is very efficient, known for scoring 97 on her final exam at the secretarial college. She wears large glasses. She has good insight into many situations, but lacks the ease in viewing life that marks her employer. She married Phuti Radiphuti in an earlier novel, The Saturday Big Tent Wedding Party, and they moved into their own new home in The Limpopo Academy of Private Detection. She is in her early 30s.\nPhuti Radiphuti: He is the owner of the Double Comfort Furniture Company and of many cattle, who is married to Grace Makutsi. He is very happy to be a father.\nMma Silvia Potokwane: Matron of the orphan farm outside Gaborone. She is a most persuasive woman, in seeking help for her orphans and keeping the place running.

The two begin a relationship that develops over the course of 10 years. In this time, Leo writes three books that he gives to Alma, since she is the only person he deeply cares about. Leo promises he will never love anyone but her.\nAlma, now 20, is sent to the United States by her father, who feared the alarming news concerning Nazi Germany. Leo does not know that Alma is pregnant and dreams of going to America to meet her. A short time after, the Germans invade Poland and Leo takes cover in the woods, living on roots, small animals, bugs and what he can steal from farmers' cellars. After three and a half years of hiding, he goes to America and finds Alma but is shocked to hear she thought he had died in the war and had married the son of the manager of the factory she works at. He is devastated when he finds she has had another child with her husband. He asks her to come with him, but she refuses. She tells him, however, about his son Isaac who is now five years old. Heartbroken, Leo leaves, and later becomes a locksmith under the guidance of his cousin. Leo regularly watches Isaac from a distance, wishing to be part of the boy's life but scared to come in contact with him.\nIn the present day, Leo is a lonely old man who waits for his death, along with his recently found childhood friend, Bruno, and Alma has been dead for five years. Leo still keeps track of his son, who has become a famous writer, much to Leo's enjoyment since he believes Isaac inherited the talent from his father. Leo's depression deepens when he reads in a newspaper that his son has died at the age of 60, and Leo develops an obsession with finding his place in his son's world, to the extent that he breaks into Isaac's house to see if he had read Words for Everything, a book about his life that he recently wrote and sent to Isaac.\nZvi Litvinoff's perspective is introduced. In the past, a younger Leo wrote a letter to his old friend Zvi, asking for his manuscript of The History of Love to be returned to him. Leo had given Zvi The History before they parted, years ago. However, his wife Rosa informs him that the book was destroyed in a flood, choosing to hide that her husband did not write The History of Love. Zvi also describes an event where Leo fell gravely ill in Poland and wrote his own obituary, after which Zvi stole it in the hope that it would keep his friend alive.\nUnknown to Leo is that the book had been published in a small printing of two thousand copies (and re-published upon the supposed author's death) in Spanish, but under the name of Zvi Litvinoff, who copied the book thinking Leo was killed in Poland. Zvi felt so guilty for copying his book that he added his friend's stolen obituary as the last chapter, telling the publisher that including the obituary was conditional to printing the book, although doing so did not make sense with the plot. Zvi died later without telling the world about the real author of The History of Love.\nIn a parallel story, a 15-year-old girl, Alma Singer, named after the Alma in The History of Love, her parents' favorite book, is struggling to cope with the loss of her father due to cancer. Her mother becomes distant and lonely, escaping into her work of book translation. Her younger brother Bird, so called for jumping from the second story of a building hoping he could fly, seeks refuge in religion and believes himself to be one of God's chosen people, thus distancing himself from reality. Alma finds refuge in one of her father's hobbies: surviving in the wild. Alma also bears a crush on her Russian pen friend Misha, who has moved to New York. The two become a couple but they break up because of Alma's incertitude.\nOne day, her mother receives a letter from a mysterious man named Jacob Marcus who requests that she translate The History of Love from Spanish to English for $100,000, to be paid in increments of $25,000 as the work progresses. Alma's mother finds the sum suspicious, but the stranger confesses that his mother used to read the book to him when he was a child, so it has a great sentimental value. Alma sees this as an opportunity to help her mother recover from her depression and changes her mother's straightforward letters to Jacob Marcus into more romantic versions. When the letters stop before her mother completes the translation of the"

Published posthumously, The Autobiography of Malcolm\u00a0X is an account of the life of Malcolm\u00a0X, born Malcolm Little (1925\u20131965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book describes Malcolm's childhood first in Omaha, Nebraska and then in the area around Lansing and Mason, Michigan, the death of his father under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her commitment to a psychiatric hospital. Little's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in organized crime. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946\u20131952). The book addresses his ministry with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam (1952\u20131963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his disillusionment with and departure from the Nation of Islam in March 1964, his pilgrimage to Mecca, which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam, and his travels in Africa. Malcolm\u00a0X was assassinated in New York's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965, before they finished the book. His co-author, journalist Alex Haley, summarizes the last days of Malcolm\u00a0X's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his subject, in the Autobiography's epilogue.\nThe Autobiography is a spiritual conversion narrative that outlines Malcolm\u00a0X's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. Literary critic Arnold Rampersad and Malcolm\u00a0X biographer Michael Eric Dyson agree that the narrative of the Autobiography resembles the Augustinian approach to confessional narrative. Augustine's Confessions and The Autobiography of Malcolm\u00a0X both relate the early hedonistic lives of their subjects, document deep philosophical change for spiritual reasons, and describe later disillusionment with religious groups their subjects had once revered. Haley and autobiographical scholar Albert E. Stone compare the narrative to the Icarus myth. Author Paul John Eakin and writer Alex Gillespie suggest that part of the Autobiography's rhetorical power comes from \"the vision of a man whose swiftly unfolding career had outstripped the possibilities of the traditional autobiography he had meant to write\", thus destroying \"the illusion of the finished and unified personality\".\nIn addition to functioning as a spiritual conversion narrative, The Autobiography of Malcolm X also reflects generic elements from other distinctly American literary forms, from the Puritan conversion narrative of Jonathan Edwards and the secular self-analyses of Benjamin Franklin, to the African American slave narratives. This aesthetic decision on the part of Malcolm X and Haley also has profound implications for the thematic content of the work, as the progressive movement between forms that is evidenced in the text reflects the personal progression of its subject. Considering this, the editors of the Norton Anthology of African American Literature assert that, \"Malcolm's Autobiography takes pains to interrogate the very models through which his persona achieves gradual self-understanding...his story's inner logic defines his life as a quest for an authentic mode of being, a quest that demands a constant openness to new ideas requiring fresh kinds of expression.\"\nHaley coauthored The Autobiography of Malcolm\u00a0X, and also performed the basic functions of a ghostwriter and biographical amanuensis, writing, compiling, and editing the Autobiography based on more than 50 in-depth interviews he conducted with Malcolm\u00a0X between 1963 and his subject's 1965 assassination. The two first met in 1959, when Haley wrote an article about the Nation of Islam for Reader's Digest, and again when Haley interviewed Malcolm\u00a0X for Playboy in 1962.\nIn 1963 the Doubleday publishing company asked Haley to write a book about the life of Malcolm\u00a0X. American writer and literary critic Harold Bloom writes, \"When Haley approached Malcolm with the idea, Malcolm gave him a startled look ...\" Haley recalls, \"It was one of the few times I have ever seen him uncertain.\" After Malcolm\u00a0X was granted permission from Elijah Muhammad, he and Haley commenced work on the Autobiography, a process which began as two-and three-hour interview sessions at Haley's studio in Greenwich Village. Bloom writes, \"Malcolm was critical of Haley's middle-class status, as well as his Christian beliefs and twenty years of service in the U.S. Military.\"\nWhen work on the Autobiography began in early 1963, Haley grew frustrated with Malcolm\u00a0X's tendency to speak only about Elijah"

The author postulates the discovery, in the near future, of the \"Gismo\", a device that can duplicate anythingeven another Gismo. Since all material objects have become essentially free, the only commodity of value is human labor, and the author suggests that a slave economy would be the inevitable result. The novel first appeared in 1959 as The People Maker (Zenith Books), based on a story in the November 1957 issue of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Knight subsequently revised the text, which was published by Berkley in 1961 as A for Anything. It is generally considered to be Knight's finest novel. ...",

An anonymous inventor sends copies of the \"Gismo\" through the mail to hundreds of people. Civil society immediately collapses; as one news commentator says: \"The big question today is: Have you got a Gismo? And believe me, nothing else matters.\"  The story jumps to the year 2149: the society we know has been replaced by a society of wealthy minority supported by slavery, and access to Gismos is jealously guarded by Gismo-produced slave guards.  The story is told through the eyes of Dick Jones, the son of the leader of Buckhill, a compound in the Poconos. Jones is coming of age and is about to be sent to Eagles, another, larger compound in the Rocky Mountains, for military training. Jones is initially presented as an unsympathetic character: spoiled, impulsive, hot-headed. In his final day at Buckhill, he insults a cousin who then  challenges Dick to a duel; Dick kills him, and has to be ushered away in secret the following morning for fear of retribution.\nJones arrives at Eagles, a fabulous city built into a mountain.  Like Buckhill, Eagles is run as a slave society; but Jones is startled to realize that the Gismo is used to duplicate slaves, and that the most trusted slaves have been copied hundreds of times. Status among citizens is determined by social connections, and, for males, by skill at hand-to-hand combat.  The author shows us the dark side of Eagles; for instance, the Boss takes pleasure in having slaves dropped down a shaft inside a tall tower and watching them plunge to their death via closed-circuit television. This may be done because it is suggested that all but the very best of slaves are \"recycled\" at about 30 years of age but with a 300 slaves for every freeman ratio at Eagles, some slaves live much longer.\nThere are hints from Jones's father in Buckhill that the slaves are contemplating revolt. In Eagles, Jones is introduced to a secret society that debates the merits of the slave culture and that plans a revolution, with the collaboration of a disaffected member of the ruling family. Jones is enthralled by the arguments he hears. At these meetings, the reader discovers that once the Gismo was sent out and the initial battles were fought, almost no scientific advances were made because the Gismo could do everything. It is hinted that some saw the time of chaos as a chance to advance space exploration but some people from the meetings say that it was all theory and nothing was ever built. But before the revolution can be put into action, the slaves revolt, killing most of the free citizens in Eagles and Buckhill, including Jones's family. Jones is forced to choose between his allegiance to kin and his yearning for a better society. In the end, Jones chooses to turn against the slaves so that he can become \"The Man\" at Buckhill replacing his murdered Father and getting society back to where it was when he left for Eagles.\nAldiss, Brian W.; Harrison, Harry (1975), Hell's Cartographers, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, p.\u00a0246, ISBN\u00a00-297-76882-4\nA for Anything title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database"

A sequel, Iron Sunrise, was published that same year. Together the two are referred to as the Eschaton novels, after a near-godlike intelligence that exists in both. The novel follows the ill-fated military campaign by a repressive state, the New Republic, to retaliate for a perceived invasion of one of its colony worlds. In actuality, the planet has been visited by the Festival, a technologically advanced alien or posthuman race that rewards its hosts for \"entertaining\" them by granting whatever the entertainer wishes, including the Festival's own technology. ...",

Singularity Sky takes place roughly in the early 23rd century, around 150 years after an event referred to by the characters as the Singularity. Shortly after the Earth's population topped 10 billion, computing technology began reaching the point where artificial intelligence could exceed that of humans through the use of closed timelike curves to send information to its past. Suddenly, one day, 90% of the population inexplicably disappeared.\nMessages left behind, both on computer networks and in monuments placed on the Earth and other planets of the inner solar system carry a short statement from the apparent perpetrator of this event:\nI am the Eschaton; I am not your God.\nI am descended from you, and exist in your future.\nThou shalt not violate causality within my historic light cone. Or else.\nEarth collapses politically and economically in the wake of this population crash; the Internet Engineering Task Force eventually assumes the mantle of the United Nations, or at least its altruistic mission and charitable functions. Anarchism replaces the Westphalian nation-states; in the novel the UN is described as having 900 of the planet's 15,000 polities as members, and its membership is not limited to polities.\nA century later, the first interstellar missions, using quantum tunnelling-based jump drives to provide effective faster-than-light travel without violating causality, are launched. One that reaches Barnard's Star finds what happened to those who disappeared from Earth: they were sent to colonise other planets via wormholes that took them back one year in time for every light-year (ly) the star was from Earth. Gradually, it is learned, these colonies were scattered across a 6,000-ly area of the galaxy, all with the same message from the Eschaton etched onto a prominent monument somewhere. There is also evidence that the Eschaton has enforced the \"or else\" through drastic measures, such as inducing supernovae or impact events on the civilisation that attempted to create causality-violating technology.\nEarth and the colonies re-establish relations and trade. Some of the latter had regained the same, or higher, technological levels due in part to the \"cornucopia machines\", molecular assemblers that can recreate objects in predefined patterns or duplicate others, the Eschaton left them with. Transhumanist technologies that came into being before or during the Singularity, such as cybernetic implants, anti-aging and life extension treatments, are in wide use. Spaceships use antimatter, fusion and electron-sized black holes as propulsion.\nSome colonies, however, rejected or restricted use of advanced technology for social, cultural or political reasons, and instead of devolving into anarchism as Earth did, have replicated politically restrictive states from Earth's history. The novel takes place on two planets of one such polity, the New Republic. Its original settlers were predominantly from Eastern Europe, where many recalled the economic dislocation that followed the fall of communism there. The victorious side in an earlier civil war destroyed the sole remaining cornucopia machine, and imposed a socially and politically repressive feudalist regime that limits most technology to a level consistent with Europe at the end of the 19th century to guarantee everyone a place in society, with accompanying Victorian social mores. Despite this, there are still those who rebel and plan uprisings, along similar lines to those that happened in the historical Eastern Europe of that era.\nThe Festival, a civilisation of uploaded minds, arrives at Rochard's World, an outlying colony of the New Republic. It begins breaking down objects in the system to make technology for its stay. Then it begins making contact with the inhabitants of the planet by dropping cell phones, forbidden to most citizens of the planet, from low orbit.\nThose who pick them up hear the Festival, \"Entertain us,\" it asks, \"and we will give you what you want.\" Interlocutors who successfully entertain the Festival by telling it something it has not heard are rewarded with anything they wish for. At first they request food or other modest needs, but then Burya Rubenstein, exiled to the colony for his role in leading an uprising, asks for a cornucopia machine in return for a political tract on the disruptive effect a sudden singularity would have on repressive regimes. Within days the theory becomes reality, as a post-scarcity economy develops and the government is threatened by Rubenstein's uprising and its advanced weaponry."

As punishment for being off-campus (and having a party), the girls are split up into separate rooms: Callie and Jenny are kept in their original room while Tinsley and Brett move to another. They spend most of their time and energy avoiding each other.\nCallie tries to deal with her breakup but is surprised when Easy asks her to go to dinner with him and his father during Trustee's Weekend because his father adores Callie and is unaware that they have broken up. Easy, who does not get along with his father, hopes to protect Jenny from his overly critical nature and believes that taking Callie would be much simpler. Callie accepts his invitation but wonders if it means that Easy is having second thoughts about their breakup.\nJenny, on the other hand, is blissfully unaware of Easy's action and continues to spend time with Brett, who decides to finally lose her virginity with her boyfriend Jeremiah Mortimer during Trustee's Weekend, after a big football game for St. Lucius.\nHowever, Tinsley helps Heath Ferro and the hot new freshman, Julian hide kegs of beer on the roof of the Dumbarton dorm and under the bed of a quiet girl who lives in a single known as The Girl In Black. After the boys leave, Tinsley throws and all girls party on the roof for all of the Dumbarton residents (excluding Brett and Jenny). Unfortunately, a staff member passing by hears the girls on the roof and attempts to a stop to it. All the girls quickly hide in their respective  rooms so no one can be blamed but the administration insists that the keg left on the roof is more than enough to hold against the dorm as a whole. Due to the Trustee Weekend event, the administration does not want to draw too much attention to the incident so the punishment is light- all Dumbarton residents are under lockdown for the weekend.  No one can enter or leave the dorm, thus ruining Brett's plans with Jeremiah.\nUpon hearing this, the guys of Waverly decide to make history by sneaking into Dumbarton while it is still on lock-down through secret tunnels built during the Cold War. Led by Heath Ferro, Easy Walsh, Brandon Buchanan, Alan St. Girard, Jeremiah Mortimer, and Julian McCafferty make it to Dumbarton unseen by the administration. Upon arrival, they break out the kegs stored under The Girl In Black's room, who turns out to be Kara Whalen, a previously chubby girl who was teased mercilessly by Heath Ferro her freshman year. In the spirit of generosity, Tinsley suggests that the girls of Dumbarton open their closets to the other residents so everyone can borrow each other's clothes. Tinsley, on a hunt for the hottest threads, checks on the kegs in Kara's room and discovers Kara has a fantastic wardrobe, thanks to her designer mother. She offers to help Kara with her make up but quickly forgets as the party begins. Jenny and Easy are reunited at the party but he still doesn't mention his dinner with his father and Callie the previous night before. Jenny leaves him in her room to grab drinks but a rumor quickly spreads that a teacher is roaming the hallways. He hides in the closet but is found by Callie who joins him. After she does so, the two begin to kiss but Easy realizes he has strong feelings for Jenny but is confused as to why he is still so attracted to Callie.\nJenny, in the meanwhile, gets pulled into Kara's room after the rumors of a teacher in Dumbarton reach her. Kara and Jenny become fast friends and begin to chat when they are interrupted by Heath Ferro, who is looking for a place to hide as well. Heath is immediately attracted to Kara and does not recognize her as 'The Whale', the nickname he gave her freshman year and attempts to pick her up. \nKara, however, is unimpressed and throws her mug of beer into Heath's face, making her one of the coolest chicks at the party.\nBrandon, unaware of the rumors about a teacher, bumps into Elizabeth Jacobs, a girl from St. Lucius. It quickly becomes apparent that the rumors about a teacher are actually about Elizabeth who has followed Jeremiah from St. Lucius. Brandon and Elizabeth quickly bond as they go around the rooms and coax the residents to continue partying as there is no threat of a teacher.\nBrett and Jeremiah quickly find each other at the beginning of the party and are about to have sex when they are interrupted by Tinsley who announces a game of 'I Never' is starting in the common room. Deciding to forgo sex for a more romantic occasion, Jeremiah and Brett agree to join the game. During the game, Yvonne Stidder starts with saying that she"

Reckless opens with twelve-year-old Jacob Reckless entering his missing father's study and discovering a strange mirror. Finding a note containing cryptic instructions, Jacob presses his hand against the glass to obscure his face. When he removes his hand, he finds himself standing in front of an identical mirror in an abandoned tower.  This world is referred to by Jacob as the Mirrorworld.  The Mirrorworld is similar to this world, but has not progressed as far technologically, and magic still runs rampant.\nTwelve years after Jacob finds his way through the mirror, Jacob's brother Will finally follows Jacob into the Mirrorworld.  Soon after Will arrives, he is attacked and scratched by a Goyl, a humanoid race with stone skin. As a result of the attack, Will's skin begins turning to stone. This curse that turns human skin to stone was created by the Dark Fairy, the Goyl King's lover. Jacob knows that the stone will soon invade his entire body, and Will will become one of the Goyl. Jacob has already lost both of his parents and cannot bear to lose his brother so he rides off in search of a cure. His old friend and mentor, Chanute, tells him that the berries that grow in the garden of child-eating witch may cure Will of the curse of the stone skin. Will sneaks back through the mirror to say goodbye to his girlfriend Clara over the phone.  Clara races to Will's house, only to discover the secret of the mirror herself.\nWith time running out, Jacob, Will, Clara and Jacob's vixen friend, Fox, journey to the witch's house, which lies deserted. When they arrive, they realize that they're being pursued by The Tailor, a creature that gets its name from how it tailors its clothing from the skin of its victims. Jacob and Fox fight The Tailor, with Will and Clara inside the gates, which The Tailor cannot enter, but Jacob is wounded on the shoulder during the fight. Will takes the berries, and they sleep. In the morning, Will's condition has not changed; the berries did not work. In another attempt to save his brother, Jacob decides to return to the Red Fairy, whom he had been enamored with for over a year, in the hope that he can convince her to help break the curse.  Jacob assumes the Red Fairy will be able to break the curse because she is the Dark Fairy's sister.  Meanwhile, Hentzau, the Goyl King's right hand, leads a group of Goyl soldiers to find Will, whose skin is turning to jade.  The jade Goyl is legendary among their people as the ultimate protector for their King, Kami'en.  The party rides to the Dwarf city Terpevas to enlist the help of Valiant, a dwarf who knows the secret location of the Valley of the Fairies. Jacob forces Valiant to join them at gunpoint.\nThe Goyl patrol ambushes the group before they are able to enter the Valley of the Fairies.  Access to the Valley is secret, but with the help of Valiant, they are able to pass through the field of blood-thirsty unicorns. Jacob then rows to the Fairies' Island while the rest of the party wait on the shore of the lake. It doesn't take Jacob long to convince Miranda, the Red Fairy, to tell Jacob how to cure Will. Miranda tells Jacob that the curse will only be lifted when the Dark Fairy is destroyed, and tells him the means to accomplish this task.  The journey to the Dark Fairy will take more time than Will has left, so she also tells Jacob how to put Will into a deep sleep, which effectively pauses the spread of the stone. As soon as Jacob returns, he leads them to the roses which Will must smell to send him to sleep. Like sleeping beauty, Will falls asleep when he is pricked.  The Goyl Soldiers are told how to cross the unicorn boundary by Valiant, ambush them and shoot Jacob. They overpower the group and take the sleeping Will captive, and leave Clara and Fox to bury Jacob. Valiant, who has developed a soft spot for Clara, stays behind, and digs a grave for Jacob. While he does this, the moths of the Red Fairy flock to Jacob's body, and the Red Fairy brings him back from the dead.\nNow on their mission to rescue Will, they travel cross country to the mountains underneath which the Goyl have built their capital city. Valiant agrees to help Jacob recover Will in return for a tree that produces golden sap.  Valiant leads them to an unguarded entrance to the Goyl city.  While in the mountains, Jacob and Clara accidentally drink from a stream of Lark's Water, which ignites passion between them.  Fox finds Clara and Jacob kissing and becomes extremely jealous.  Jacob and Valiant decide to leave Clara and Fox behind. Valiant manages to smuggle Jacob into the Goyl city, by pretending Jacob is a"

Conan the Liberator is a fantasy novel  by American writers L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, featuring Robert E. Howard's  sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in paperback by Bantam Books in February 1979, and reprinted in 1982; later paperback editions were issued by Ace Books (July 1987 and April 1991). The first hardcover edition was published by Tor Books in June 2002; a trade paperback followed from the same publisher in 2003. The first British edition was from Sphere Books (July 1987). The novel was later gathered together with Conan the Swordsman and Conan and the Spider God into the omnibus collection Sagas of Conan (Tor Books, 2004).\nHoward himself never wrote the tale of this turning point of Conan's life, when, starting as wandering mercenary and pirate, he became a king. The only detail provided in the canonical Howard stories is that Conan strangled Numedides on his own throne and then crowned himself with the dead king's crown. Carter and de Camp, filling in this link in Conan's career, show that a prolonged, arduous military campaign was needed before he got to this point, that there were many setbacks and moments when all seemed lost. Also, while Conan's own courage and perseverance played a crucial role, his success also owed a great deal to a band of loyal and dedicated companions, some of whom did not survive to see the final victory.\nShortly before publication of the first hardcover edition in 2002 Kirkus Reviews pronounced that \"[o]nce again, de Camp and Carter mime Howard's hyperbolic spirit and majestic inverted syntax with great style.\" The review expressed no other opinion as to the merit of the novel.\nMichael Rogers in Library Journal wrote \"[t]he plot is typical,\" but \"[d]espite the corny story, de Camp and Carter's solid rep in the sword and sorcery world will guarantee fun for fans of the series.\"\nDon D'Ammassa called the book \"a pretty good story\" and noted that \"the military encounters are very well constructed.\"\nLaughlin, Charlotte; Daniel J.

The novel chronicles the travels and perils of Freya Nakamichi-47, a gynoid in a distant future in which humanity is extinct and a near-feudal android society has spread throughout the galaxy. Wealthy and self-indulgent \"aristos\" own and have enslaved most of the populace; the remaining \"free\" androids struggle to keep themselves independent and can rarely afford the exorbitant costs of interplanetary travel. Freya, a robotic courtesan originally designed to please humans but activated a century after their mysterious extinction, is considered obsolete and works menial jobs to survive. When she offends an aristo and needs to escape off-world, she accepts a job as a courier for the mysterious Jeeves Corporation and becomes embroiled in a complex and dangerous war among factions conspiring against each other for control of society.\nSaturn's Children is an homage to the works of Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein, in particular Heinlein's 1982 novel Friday. The novel opens with an explanation of Asimov\u2019s Three Laws of Robotics, and then establishes that humans are extinct. Jesse Willis of SFFaudio.com commented:\nStross has quite a lot of fun playing with the world he\u2019s created here, naming a city Heinleingrad, naming a robot butler character after P. G. Wodehouse\u2019s famous \u201cgentleman\u2019s personal gentleman.\" It all mostly works with Saturn\u2019s Children seeming to take most of its inspiration though from Heinlein\u2019s novel Friday. Both novels feature artificial female persons as secret couriers, both tell their own stories, both secrete their smuggled cargos in their abdomens. Later on in Saturn\u2019s Children there is some playing with the ideas promulgated in Heinlein\u2019s 1970 novel I Will Fear No Evil. And, identity, in a world where brain data, and brain states, are easily and quickly copyable, isn\u2019t as simple as it is with us meatbags.\nBookmarks magazine called the novel \"a commentary on identity and free will in a post-human galaxy\", adding:\nThe combination of sex and violence clashes a bit with some deep philosophizing on identity and purpose, though Stross\u2019s sense of humor and Freya\u2019s rollicking adventure transcend what SF Reviews deems \"some bizarre cross-genre hybrid.\" Many SF readers will appreciate the novel, deemed as one of Stross\u2019s more accessible, and revel in the author\u2019s numerous nods toward his influences; others might want to give it a pass.\nBooklist praised Saturn's Children as \u201cone of the most stylishly imaginative robot tales ever penned\", and The Times described it as \"a smart and playful romp.\u201d The San Diego Union-Tribune called the novel \u201cGood fun ... Heinlein himself would\u2019ve liked this.\u201d Calling it an \"erotic futuristic thriller\", Publishers Weekly pointed out that the novel contains \"a deep message of how android slavery recapitulates humanity's past mistakes\", but also suggests that Stross \"struggles to make it heard over the moans and gunshots\". Adrienne Martini of the Baltimore City Paper wrote that \"Stross seems to be saying something about identity and class, but those larger ideas get buried in a labyrinthine plot that isn\u2019t overly satisfying on its own,\" adding that \"for a Heinlein fan, Saturn\u2019s Children is an interesting game of spot the reference.\" Jesse Willis of SFFaudio.com wrote:\nThe idea of a post-human solar system is an interesting one, and Stross plays with it quite effectively ... This humanless solar system is ... quite vividly explored, with floating cities ... on Venus, waste heated bio-labs on the frozen dwarf planet of Eris, and a truly frightening description of what\u2019s happened to poor old Earth ... The worst sin here is that the ending is rather weak.\nSaturn's Children was nominated for the 2009 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the 2009 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and was a finalist for the 2009 Prometheus Award.\nThough Stross wrote Saturn's Children as a standalone novel, he published a short story sequel called \"Bit Rot\" in the 2010 anthology Engineering Infinity and later made it available online. In the story, a descendant android of Freya's named Lilith Nakamichi-47 is on a long interstellar voyage as a catastrophic event wreaks havoc on the spaceship and its occupants. Robert E. Waters of Tangent classified \"Bit Rot\" as \"one of the hardest SF stories\" in the anthology, and called it \"one of the most clever zombie stories in recent memory.\" Lois Tilton of Locus agreed, calling it \"an exceedingly neat idea for a space horror story, twisting"

The book courted political controversy due to Alan Duncan's role as a Conservative MP and Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Brian Mawhinney. As a consequence, many of the book's stridently libertarian messages disagreed with the position of Duncan's party, which, at the time, was suffering considerable internal divisions, culminating in a leadership contest in 1995.\nPerhaps the most controversial of the policies advocated in the book was the position taken that all drugs, currently controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, should be legally available to the public. When the book was published in paperback, this chapter was omitted. Not wanting to hide his views, Duncan at one time posted the offending chapter on his official website, \"for the benefit of the enquiring student\".\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20010419170147/http://www.alanduncan.org.uk/media/saturnschildrenchapter.htm"

[Boston, MA]. The Gates Ajar is an 1868 religious novel by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps (later Elizabeth Phelps Ward) that was immensely popular following its publication.  It was the second best-selling religious novel of the 19th century. 80,000 copies were sold in America by 1900; 100,000 were sold in England during the same time period.  Sequels Beyond the Gates (1883) and The Gates Between (1887) were also bestsellers, and the three together are referred to as the author's \"Spiritualist novels.\"\nAnd when my angel guide went up, \nHe left the pearly gates ajar.\n\n---Mrs. Adoniram Judson [Emily C.]   \nThe novel is presented like a diary by its main protagonist, Mary Cabot, who mourns the death of her brother Royal. Much of the plot is presented as a dialogue about the afterlife between the two women. The novel represents heaven as being similar to Earth (but better). In contrast with traditions of Calvinism, Phelps's version of heaven is corporeal where the dead have \"spiritual bodies\", live in houses, raise families, and participate in various activities. The idea was not original to Phelps; at least one earlier book, the anonymous Heaven Our Home, was advertising as early as 1863 about its vision of \"a Social Heaven in which there will be the most Perfect Recognition, Intercourse, Fellowship, and Bliss.\nPhelps began writing The Gates Ajar in the final year of the American Civil War, inspired in part by the death of her mother, stepmother, and her fianc\u00e9 who was killed at the Battle of Antietam. Phelps later claimed the book came from divine inspiration: \"The angel said unto me 'Write!' and I wrote.\" She spent two years revising the book in her father's attic. Frustrated by the insignificant role women played during the War, she wrote the book specifically with a female audience in mind. In an autobiography, she reflected, \"Into that great world of woe my little book stole forth, trembling... I do not think I thought so much about the suffering of men... but the women,\u2014the helpless, outnumbering, unconsulted women.\" Emily Dickinson, according to scholar Barton Levi St. Armand, was among those who believed in a similar vision of the afterlife and found the book helpful in organizing those thoughts.\nThe book was published in November 1868 by Fields, Osgood, and Company. Along with an initial royalty check for $600, publisher James T. Fields reported to her, \"Your book is moving grandly. It has already a sale of four thousand copies.\"\nThe Gates Ajar, according to Helen Sootin Smith, incorporates at least four literary elements: \"sermon, diary, sentimental domestic plot, and allegory.\"  She identified the latter as its \"most important literary form.\"\nThe Gates Ajar, as a sacred allegory, relates the steps in Christian redemption.  The rude, willful Mary in the opening chapters represents that of unregenerate man, who has succumbed to the temptations of 'the world, the flesh, and the devil.'. . .\nRoyal Cabot, however, did not die in vain.  He is Christ, dying in the Civil War for the sins of mankind. As Christ's death redeemed mankind so that it could be reunited with Him in heaven, so Roy's death saves Mary for everlasting life with him. \nPhelps published two similar books, Beyond the Gates (1883) and The Gates Between (1887), though they are not traditional sequels as they do not continue with the plot or characters of The Gates Ajar. She later lamented she did not write more, partially because of how much effort she had expended so quickly because of her financial duress. In a letter to George Eliot, she wrote:\n I do not hope much for it now; I am physically too far spent even to do what is a bitter comfort to hope I might have done, if the success of 'The Gates Ajar' had not driven a very young woman who wanted money, into rapid and unstudious work before the evil days came when work must be quietly put out of the imagination like other forms of suicide.\nThe Gates Ajar was successful and established Phelps's career and impressed upon the author her ability to influence culture and gave her the confidence to pursue women's rights. By January 1870, one critic estimated, \"Miss Phelps has made $20,000 out of The Gates Ajar. She won't be likely to shut them at this rate.\" It is estimated that the book sold over 80,000 copies in the United States.\nThe book was part of a wave of some eighty books concerning the afterlife that were published in the decade following the Civil War (during which very little such literature appeared). Its popularity has been described as fueled by Americans seeking the help"

Kenji Yoshino, the author, is the Chief Justice Earl Warren Professor of Constitutional Law at the NYU School of Law. He wrote an article in the Yale Law Journal called Covering in 2002, but went into more extensive detail on the subject of covering using legal manifesto and poetic memoirs.

Yoshino, writing in a poetic tone, shares personal anecdotes to help frame the larger, societal issues he covers later in the book. He explores the idea and concept of a \"normal\" sexuality, with most conflict occurring as an adolescent and college student. His internal struggle to accept and embrace his identity inform the beginning of covering.  Afterwards, when a colleague cautions him to be \"a homosexual professional\" instead of \"a professional homosexual\", Yoshino begins to reflect on the concept of muting different identities.\nYoshino then introduces the concept of \"covering,\" explaining:\nIn the new generation, discrimination directs itself not against the entire group, but against the subset of the group that fails to assimilate to mainstream norms. This new form of discrimination targets minority cultures rather than minority persons.  Outsiders are included, but only if we behave like insiders - that is, only if we cover. ...\nThis covering demand is the civil rights issue of our time.  It hurts not only our most vulnerable citizens but our most valuable commitments.  For if we believe a commitment against racism is about equal respect for all races, we are not fulfilling that commitment if we protect only racial minorities who conform to historically white norms. \nYoshino's struggles with identity took various forms, and he writes that felt \"neither Japanese nor American, neither poet nor pragmatist, neither straight nor gay.\" \nYoshino's main source of activism concerns gay rights, and argues that the idea and need for assimilation is inherently damaging, using the gay concepts of assimilation and closeted behavior as ways to frame the conversation on civil rights.\nPart One deals with the \"conversion\", \"passing\" and \"covering\" of homosexuality: \"If conversion divides ex-gays from gays, and passing divides closeted gays from out gays, covering divides normal from queers.\"\nHomosexuality was not a very accepted trait. During the 1960s there were \"voluntarily\" embraced conversion therapy for the homosexual. This process created by Katz was said to \"fix\" someone's \"problem\" of homosexuality. In 1952, the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders classified homosexuality as a psychopathologic problem. Though conversion therapy is scarce today, conversion therapists feel that Americans have been brainwashed into accepting homosexuality after such strong thoughts against the sexuality during the mid-late 1990s. To sum up the first chapter:\nThe gay critique of assimilation begins here. Conversion is the ultimate demand for assimilation- while passing and covering leave the underlying identity relatively intact, conversion destroys it. When someone asks for conversion, the difference between the two available refusals is immense. Which will we choose? Will we say we cannot change? Or will we, like the early gay activists, say we will not change, meeting the demands for conversion with a demand for equality?\nWhile in Oxford, Yoshino had fallen in love. The person he loved was not a woman. He had to tell his dad this. He then came out to his mom. Though they were both supportive, he knew that this was not what they wanted. Passing is best defined through the \"don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\" policy, which has been in effect since the Congress and the Department of Defense put it in place in 1993. Rather than trying to change a gay person's perspective and likings, they would just ignore the fact that a person was gay. The shift from conversion to passing was gradual and did not necessary represent an advance in society's acceptance of homosexuals, because of their overlapping. Passing was an act that his parents demonstrated. Though they accepted the fact that Kenji was gay, it was not something talked about, and more ignored from their thought of their son.\nYoshino met his first boyfriend in 1995. Through the act of covering, Yoshino never brought his boyfriend to work events or talked about his boyfriend in public, when around straight people. Homosexuals see this as \"acting-straight\" as heterosexuals see flamboyant acts as \"acting-gay.\" Acting \"normal\" or \"acting-straight\" is seen as covering. Though you do not doubt the fact you are homosexual, you also do not radically protest for it and show the world that you are gay. Yoshino writes: \nCovering seems a more complex form of assimilation than conversion or passing. At the most basic level, it raises thornier issues of classification. I'm sometimes asked, for instance, whether I consider same-sex marriage to be an act"

In April 1967, 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen is admitted to McLean Hospital, in Belmont, Massachusetts, after attempting suicide by overdosing on pills. She denies that it was a suicide attempt to a psychiatrist, who suggests she take time to regroup in McLean, a private mental hospital. Susanna is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and her stay extends to 18 months rather than the proposed couple of weeks.\nFellow patients Polly, Cynthia, Lisa Rowe, Lisa Cody, Georgina and Daisy contribute to Susanna's experiences at McLean as she describes their personal issues and how they come to cope with the time they must spend in the hospital. Susanna also introduces the reader to particular staff members, including Valerie, Dr. Wick and Mrs. McWeeney. Susanna and the other girls are eventually informed that the recently released Daisy died by suicide on her birthday. Daisy's death deeply saddens the girls and they hold a prolonged moment of silence in her memory.\nSusanna reflects on the nature of her illness, including difficulty making sense of visual patterns, and suggests that sanity is a falsehood constructed to help the \"healthy\" feel \"normal\" in comparison. She also questions how doctors treat mental illness, and whether they are treating the brain or the mind. During her stay in the ward, Susanna also undergoes a period of depersonalization, where she bites open the flesh on her hand after she becomes terrified that she has \"lost her bones.\" She develops a frantic obsession with the verification of this proposed reality and even insists on seeing an X-ray of herself to make sure. This hectic moment is described with shorter, choppy sentences that show Kaysen's state of mind and thought processes as she went through them. Also, during a trip to the dentist with Valerie, Susanna becomes frantic after she wakes from the general anesthesia, when no one will tell her how long she was unconscious, and she fears that she has lost time. Like the incident with her bones, Kaysen here also rapidly spirals into a panicky and obsessive state that is only ultimately calmed with medication.\nAfter leaving McLean, Susanna mentions that she kept in touch with Georgina and eventually saw Lisa, now a single mother who was about to board the subway with her toddler son and seemed, although quirky, to be sane.\nGirl, Interrupted does not follow a linear storyline, but instead the author provides personal stories through a series of short descriptions of events and personal reflections on why she was placed in the hospital. She begins by talking about the concept of a parallel universe and how easy it is to slip into one, comparing insanity to an alternate world. She discusses how some people fall into insanity gradually and others just snap. Kaysen also details the doctor's visit before first going to the hospital and the taxi ride there at the beginning of the book before launching into the chronicles of her time at the hospital.\nThere are two main groups of characters, the patients and the staff. In addition to those there are her parents, her boyfriend and various other minor characters such as her former boss.\nSusanna Kaysen\nThe autobiographical main character, Susanna Kaysen is admitted to a psychiatric ward to be treated for borderline personality disorder following a suicide attempt. She voluntarily admits herself after a short consultation with a psychiatrist who is also an acquaintance of the family. She is told that she will only be staying there for a few weeks, but it turns out to be one and a half years instead. Throughout the book, she frequently contrasts the time of the consultation, twenty minutes, to the time she ended up spending there.\nLisa Rowe\nLisa is diagnosed as a sociopath, but whether she actually is one is left open to interpretation. Lisa periodically escapes from the hospital, only to be found a day or two later and re-admitted. She is usually happy enough to be back though she does put up a fight when restrained. She is an ex-junkie who never sleeps and barely eats, and enjoys making trouble for the staff. She apparently takes some pride in her diagnosis. Although she has a therapist assigned to her, she never actually sees him. Lisa is not in contact with her family except her brother, but the extent of their contact is not described. She also has a lawyer, though it appears he is mostly used to threaten the staff if she doesn't get what she wants. Her behavior is wildly unpredictable, and while she can be kind, she is also capable of cruelty towards the other patients. For example, Lisa has"

Will is an American journalist living in Paris. On leave from his duties writing about international politics at the Journal, he travels around the globe as he works on a novel in which he intends to expose the domination of the world by women. Through his friend Kate, Will has become aware of a secret international organization called the World Organization for Male Annihilation and a New Natality, or WOMANN, that intends to stage a secret takeover of world power. WOMANN's secret manifesto details a plan to take over the world by strictly controlling the reproductive process through the use of abortion, sperm banks, and artificial insemination; by expurgating, banning, or \"contextualizing\" the products of certain male geniuses; and also by declaring war on the patriarchal tyranny of religion through a campaign of \"divide and rule.\" Will, who is a freethinker and notorious womanizer, is marked as an enemy by WOMANN. The novel follows Will's sexual escapades around the world with a number of women whose interest in the novel he is writing (the novel we are reading) leads him to suspect he is being surveilled by WOMANN. Will has enlisted a notorious French novelist, \"S.\" (who bears significant similarities to Philippe Sollers), to publish the novel under S's name since Will is worried about the response of his family in the United States if he were to publish it under his own name. Will's monologue about his life and opinions includes extended digressions about such topics as politics, literature, sex, contemporary life, religion, and the Bible. Will's amorous exploits are occasionally interrupted by time spent at home with his wife, Deb, and his son Stephen. He is eventually injured in a terrorist attack that kills his lover Cyd, an English TV journalist. The novel concludes with Will leaving Paris to start a new life with Deb and Stephen in New York City.\nReaders and critics greeted Women enthusiastically when the book was first published in France in 1983. The novel was a best-seller in France and was celebrated by critics as \"one of the best books in recent years.\" Roland Champagne, in his book-length survey of Sollers's career, attributed the book's popularity to the \"sense of humor that [Sollers] exhibits with his narrating voice,\" and went on to say that the character of Will, the protagonist of Women, is emblematic of Sollers's tendency to model his protagonists on himself, a dynamic Champagne described as \"the self as humorous other.\"\nElaine Kendall, writing in the Los Angeles Times, called Women \"ferociously misogynistic\" and wrote that the novel \"splinters into frank pornography.\" Kendall went on to say that \"Women may be the first pointillist post-feminist novel,\" and contended that \"Women stridently demands to be taken seriously as a nihilistic satire on philosophy, religion, the arts, social science, America, France, and whatever else swims into view.\"\nOther reviewers were less troubled by the ostensibly misogynist content. Leon Roudiez, writing in World Literature Today, maintained that in opposition to the book's \"macho rhythm,\" Sollers's writing in Women also displayed \"a female tide that gives it a complex, perplexing quality.\" Roudiez went on to praise Women as \"a personal prospect of the intellectual, literary, and political scene during the past few years as well as an account of [Sollers's] own concerns and obsessions.\" Roudiez was laudatory in his assessment, calling Women \"a book that should be read by all those interested in the contemporary scene as well as those who might be troubled by Bataille's notion of eroticism as the sanctioning of life unto death.\" Roudiez contended that the book \"might teach us more about contemporary reality than the ponderous writings of historians could do.\"\nThe Antioch Review, in its assessment of Women, hailed the novel as \"a very interesting trip into the fantastic mental Odyssey of a modern writer.\" In particular, the Antioch Review found Will to be a fascinating character, describing him as \"witty, aggressive, narcissistic, and driven by the relentless desire to explore contemporary life.\"\nThe London Review of Books gave a more measured assessment of Women and emphasized the correspondences between the characters in the novel and real luminaries from the French literary and philosophical world: \"Women is not only, as the title suggests, a kiss-and-tell epic ... but an explicit roman \u00e0 clef containing mildly scandalous and instantly recognizable portraits of such celebrated figures as Lacan, Althusser, and Barthes.\"  Conceding that Women is \"infectiously high-spirited at times,\" the"

In contrast to Factotum, Post Office and Ham on Rye, Women is centered on Chinaski's later life, as a celebrated poet and writer, not as a dead-end lowlife. It does, however, feature the same constant carousel of women with whom Chinaski only finds temporary fulfillment.",

When asked about his relationship to women, he said that they gave much more than he gave to the relationship, and this acts as a central foundation to the development of Chinaski as a character, especially in the beginning of the novel.\nOne of the first women featured in the book, who also recurred throughout the novel through random phonecalls and thoughts, is a character named Lydia Vance; she is based on Bukowski's one-time girlfriend, the sculptor and sometime poet Linda King.  Chinaski's last face-to-face encounter with Lydia ended with her breaking into his house, destroying his paintings and books, and being arrested by police shortly afterwards; Chinaski refused to press charges, because Lydia had children she was struggling for custody for, and the charge would reflect negatively on that.  But as soon as she was released, she called and threatened Chinaski again.\nAfter Lydia, there is an endless list of women that Chinaski goes through: Dee Dee (a successful Jewish music executive, \"How the fatherland would've looked at us,\" he sarcastically sighed while with her), Tammie (an immature 20 year old woman and speed addict), Iris (an Indian-Canadian belly dancer met while giving a reading in Canada), Debra (a successful court documents company manager and paralegal), Laura (a Texas woman that Bukowski renamed to \"Katherine\" because she looked like Katherine Hepburn), Sara (a health food nut who worked at a health food store), Cassie (rejected outright when Chinaski called and heard a man's voice respond), Tanya (a 23-year-old promiscuous mother, a 90-pound \"tiny girl-child,\" and Chinaski's pen-pal), and Rochelle (the first and last woman he rejects in order to grow his final relationship, appearing only on the second to last page).\nIn fact, a number of characters are introduced by means of sending a letter to Chinaski admiring his work (usually with photo if successful) and wanting to meet him.  A good number of other female characters (who are sexual with Chinaski) are friends or co-workers of his other partners or friends, such as Valerie, the girlfriend of his friend Bobby, an LA musician, and one of the subordinate clerks of Debra.  Several of Chinaski's sex acts in this work, including anal sex with non-consenting partners who were drunk or unconscious, are vividly described in this book.\nAt first, Chinaski slowly realizes that he is not beneficial to the women he is with when some of them ask him questions about this.  This latent theme grows and grows, and it becomes the final plot, which revolves around a developing guilt complex as Chinaski is increasingly made aware of both how he has hurt these women and ultimately how he has pushed good women away from himself by his behavior.  In excuse, he says he does this because he wasn't loved enough as a child and that he was insufficiently intimate with women in his 20's and 30's, having married a sexless woman who was 35 when he himself was only 25.\nThis is in contrast to his other slowly-diminishing feeling, the shameless feeling that he was once a \"lowly\" postal worker, now was \"famous writer\", and needed to celebrate this every instant with alcohol and many sexual partners, making up for lost time in his 20's and 30's.  He mentions his former, postal co-workers, and how they would think of him, during a threesome with two women whose summed ages was less than his age.\nLos Angeles is the backdrop to the work for the majority, except when he travels to New York, Canada, or elsewhere to give readings of his material.  He constantly derides his own poor, unsafe neighborhood, the large amount of prostitution available (even when he is a client of these services), and the fact that \"all American women wear pants.\"  Political commentary on these conditions, though powerful, would only amount to a few paragraphs or few pages of the work.\nIn the book, Chinaski's nickname is Hank, which was one of Bukowski's nicknames.\nChinaski and Tanya had a weekend tryst. The real-life counterpart to this character wrote a self-published chapbook about the affair entitled \"Blowing My Hero\" under the pseudonym Amber O'Neil. The washed-up folksinger \"Dinky Summers\" is based on Bob Lind.\nBukowski himself drew the picture of the woman on the cover of the book.  During the work, he does mention traveling to Paris France to meet a woman and learn painting, which probably influenced this piece.\nThe book was simultaneously published in Australia"

The Eight, published 1988, is American author Katherine Neville's debut novel. It is an adventure/quest novel in which the heroine, computer whiz Catherine Velis, must enter into a cryptic world of danger and conspiracy in order to recover the pieces of a legendary chess set once owned by Charlemagne, and buried for one thousand years.\nA sequel, The Fire, appeared in 2008.\nThe Montglane Service and Abbey are the creations of Katherine Neville. In The Eight, the set was once owned by Charlemagne. Its design is of early Indian influence and it is created from solid gold and precious gems. The weight and size of each piece is quite large, with pawns starting at about 3 inches high and kings and queens at 6 inches. The story describes how the Montglane Service received its name after it was given by Charlemagne to a loyal friend who controlled the Montglane region of France, and who later willed it to be protected by the nuns of Montglane. Neville based her concept of the chess set on similar sets described in medieval romances such as the \"Legend of Charlemagne\".\nThe Eight received positive reviews from the San Francisco Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times Book Review. The Washington Post Book World called it \"a feminist answer to Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Florence King of The New York Times reviewed the book negatively, criticizing the plot and Neville's writing. Publisher's Weekly said, \"this spellbinder soars above the level of first-rate escapist entertainment.\u201d Detroit News called the novel \u201cA gutsy, multi-genre leap through history, full of puzzles and mysteries\u2026 The Eight\u2018s plotting and execution are masterfully handled.\u201d \u201cIntriguing, fast-moving\u2026 Crammed with skullduggery and a chess-based plot that hops between the eighteenth and [twentieth] centuries,\" said the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Booklist praised the novel, stating, \u201cThe taut, suspenseful narrative is interwoven with a seemingly infinite number of mathematical puzzles, crosswords, and cryptograms\u2026 History, mystery, and adventure galore.\u201d\nNeville, Katherine (December 27, 1988).

Initially written as a stand-alone novel, Gemmell expanded it into a trilogy consisting of the novels:\nWolf in Shadow (1987)\nThe Last Guardian (1989)\nBloodstone (1994)\nWolf in Shadow is set in the future, three hundred years after the \"fall\", an apocalyptic event of which little is initially known, but which is regarded in the book as an event akin to Noah's flood in which the world shook out of its orbit tilting it on its axis, which subsequently resulted in the oceans rising and destroying most of human civilization. Several hints are given throughout the novel that this catastrophe might have been due to factors such as pollution and nuclear weapons.\nIn addition to this setting the novel employs a magic system based on Sipstrassi or stones of power, which are golden meteors which allow one to heal oneself, create food, and who are supposedly limited only by ones imagination, although each stone only has a certain amount of power, and as they are used black veins will appear upon the stone and grow, until eventually the Sipstrassi is coal black, and powerless. However, by feeding Sipstrassi blood one can refill them, although Sipstrassi refilled in this manner become blood red, incapable of healing or producing feed, good only for combat. Additionally blood Sipstrassi inspire darker feelings such as lust, greed, and rage in their wielders.\nCurrent critical reception of Wolf in Shadow is largely positive with the book rating Goodreads assigning an average rating of 4.1 with 1291 ratings(as of the 1st of March 2012). A similar score of 8.3/10 is given on the website fantasy book review.  However, in the foreword of The Last Guardian Gemmell mentions that while most reviews were either very good or indifferent, one reviewer(whose name is not fully revealed beyond him having the surname Broome) greatly disliked the novel.  Of his criticisms Gemmell only mentions the line \"I dread to think of people who look up to men like Jon Shannow.\". This review in particular led to the introduction of a character Josiah Broome in subsequent novels, who allowed Gemmell to show a contrast between Shannow, a man unhesitating in using force to combat what he saw as evil, and Broome a man who regarded the use of force as an evil unto itself.\n\"The Jerusalem Man\".

Other cultures such as the French have their rendezvous term to describe this third realm, though as the American English language has no vocabulary to describe this third realm, Oldenburg adopts the accepted term third place to describe these locations throughout the book.\nOther than the numerous personal benefits third places offer their regulars, Oldenburg advocates for the immense social value they bring and points out their historical role, amongst others:\nThe American tavern in the American Revolution\nThe French caf\u00e9 in the French Revolution\nThe London coffee house during the Enlightenment\nThe agora in Greek democracy\nThe largest causes underlined in the passing of third places are urban planning practices and suburban development.

It was first serialized in the periodical Gil Blas and published in novel form by Charpentier in 1883. The novel is set in the world of the department store, an innovative development in mid-nineteenth century retail sales. Zola models his store after Le Bon March, which consolidated under one roof many of the goods hitherto sold in separate shops. The narrative details many of Le Bon March's innovations, including its mail-order business, its system of commissions, its in-house staff commissary, and its methods of receiving and retailing goods. Au Bonheur des Dames is a sequel to Pot-Bouille. ...",

The events of Au Bonheur des Dames cover approximately 1864-1869.\nThe novel tells the story of Denise Baudu, a 20-year-old woman from Valognes who comes to Paris with her younger brothers and begins working as a saleswoman at the department store \"Au Bonheur des Dames\". Zola describes the inner workings of the store from the employees' perspective, including the 13-hour workdays, the substandard food and the bare lodgings for the female staff. Many of the conflicts in the novel spring from each employee's struggle for advancement and the malicious infighting and gossip among the staff.\nDenise's story is played against the career of Octave Mouret, the owner of Au Bonheur des Dames, whose retail innovations and store expansions threaten the existence of all the neighborhood shops. Under one roof, Octave has gathered textiles (silks, woolens) as well as all manner of ready-made garments (dresses, coats, lingerie, gloves), accessories necessary for making clothes, and ancillary items like carpeting and furniture. His aim is to overwhelm the senses of his female customers, forcing them to spend by bombarding them with an array of buying choices and by juxtaposing goods in enticing and intoxicating ways. Massive advertising, huge sales, home delivery, and a system of refunds and novelties such as a reading room and a snack bar further induce his female clientele to patronize his store in growing numbers. In the process, he drives the traditional retailers who operate smaller speciality shops out of business.\nIn Pot-Bouille, an earlier novel, Octave is depicted as a ladies' man, sometimes inept, who seduces or attempts to seduce women who can give him some social or financial advantage. In Au Bonheur des Dames, he uses a young widow to influence a political figure\u2013modeled after Baron Haussmann\u2013in order to gain frontage access to a huge thoroughfare, the present day rue de Quatre-Septembre, for the store.\nDespite his contempt for women, Octave finds himself slowly falling in love with Denise, whose refusal to be seduced by his charms further inflames him. The book ends with Denise admitting her love for Octave and has sex with him in bed.\nZola designed the Rougon-Macquart novels to demonstrate how heredity and environment operate on the members of one family over the course of the Second French Empire. In this case, the environment is the department store.\nOctave Mouret is introduced briefly in La fortune des Rougon. He plays a larger but background role in La conqu\u00eate de Plassans, which focuses on his parents, the first cousins Marthe Rougon and Fran\u00e7ois Mouret. As an innovator and risk-taker, Octave combines his mother's imagination with his father's business sense, making the department store the perfect milieu for his natural gifts.\nOctave's brother is the priest Serge (La faute de l'Abb\u00e9 Mouret), who served as a guardian to their mentally challenged sister Desir\u00e9e.\nIn Le docteur Pascal, the final novel in the series set in 1872-1873, Octave and Denise are married and have three children. Octave also appears briefly or is mentioned in La joie de vivre and L'\u0153uvre.\nThe novel has been adapted for film several times. \nZum Paradies der Damen (1922) directed by Lupu Pick\nAu bonheur des dames (1930) directed by Julien Duvivier starring Dita Parlo\nAu Bonheur des Dames (English: Shop Girls of Paris) (1943) directed by Andr\u00e9 Cayatte starring Blanchette Brunoy\nThe BBC used the novel as the basis for a 2012 eight-part television series set in northern England titled The Paradise. It starred Joanna Vanderham  and Emun Elliott. The BBC launched a second series in October 2013.\nThe novel was also adapted as an Italian language television series in 2015, Il Paradiso delle Signore, which has run for several seasons and stars Giuseppe Zeno and Giusy Buscemi.\nThe novel was adapted for the stage, with the title The Department Store, by Justin Fleming, and was premiered at The Old Fitzroy Theatre Sydney in 2005, directed by Christopher Hurrell.\nThe novel was adapted into a play for BBC Radio 4 that premiered in September 2010.\nShop Girls of Paris (1883, tr.

The Welcome Table: A Lifetime of Memories with Recipes. pages: 218. pub_date: 2004. publisher: Random House. Angelou learned to cook by observing her mother and grandmother. Her grandmother, Annie Henderson, who raised Angelou and her brother for most of their childhood, supported herself and her family during the early part of the 20th century and the Depression with food stalls catering for Black factory workers, which eventually developed into a store. Despite no previous experience, Angelou was a cook in a Creole restaurant when she was a 17-year-old single mother. She has called herself both a writer and a cook, which inspired The Welcome Table.\nAccording to Angelou's biographer Marcia Ann Gillespie and her co-authors, Angelou's \"skill in the kitchen is the stuff of legend\u2014from haute cuisine to down-home comfort food\". Angelou is known for her \"good cooking and expansive hospitality\", and hosts several celebrations each year at her main residence in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, including Thanksgiving.  She followed up The Welcome Table with a second cookbook, Great Food, All Day Long: Cook Splendidly, Eat Smart, published in 2010, which focused on weight loss through portion control and flavor.\nWelcome Table is dedicated \"to every wannabe cook who will dare criticism by getting into the kitchen and stirring up some groceries\", and well as to Angelou's friend Oprah Winfrey, \"who said she wanted a big, pretty cookbook\". Angelou adds: \"Well, honey, here you are\". Angelou, on her acknowledgement page, also thanks \"all the great cooks whose food I have eaten and whose stories I have heard\".  She thanks those who helped her compile the recipes in the book, and her family, who sampled her food. She also thanked Brian Lanker, who photographed the dishes, and Brian Daigle, who drove her tour bus as she and her assistant, Lydia Stuckey, traveled the U.S.\nThe first half of Welcome Table is made up of Angelou's grandmother's and mother's recipes, along with anecdotes associated with them; the second half of the book includes \"a dazzling array of international grownup tales, flavored with a collage of recipes joined together by association with Angelou\". The Baltimore Sun states that Angelou \"uses remembered meals and dishes as a prism through which to view her own life, its turning points and its intersections with the lives of others\". The essays focus on events, paired with food, that occurred throughout Angelou's life, from her childhood in Stamps, Arkansas, to her adolescence and young adulthood spent with her mother Vivian Baxter, and to her career, which brought her fame. She impresses a prospective employer with Southern food; he tells her, \"If you can write half as good as you can cook, you are going to be famous.\" As her fame grows, \"the food world widens (tamales, p\u00e2t\u00e9, minestrone, chachouka)\" and her dining companions are also among the famous (Oprah Winfrey, Jessica Mitford, Rosa Guy). She serves what M. F. K. Fisher called \"the first honest cassoulet I have eaten in years\".\nThe reviewer in Publishers Weekly characterises Welcome Table as a \"collection of tear- and laughter-provoking vignettes\". He also calls Angelou's food \"delectable and comfortable\", and states that her directions were simple but clear enough for experienced cooks. The Chicago Tribune, which re-created Angelou's recipes in their test kitchen, reports that their tasters gave the dishes high marks, but states that the instructions were not always clear for beginners. Angelou's caramel cake was considered delicious, but its frosting non-traditional.\nSodergren, Rebecca (February 3, 2011). \"Food Column: How cooking is like poetry\". Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

O. Beeton Publishing. subject: Cookery. The author, Isabella Beeton, was 21 years old when she started working on the book. It was initially serialised in 24 monthly instalments, in her husband Samuel Orchart Beeton's publication The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine; the first instalment appeared in 1859. On 1 October 1861, the instalments were collected into one volume with the title The Book of Household Management, comprising information for the Mistress, Housekeeper, Cook, Kitchen-Maid, Butler, Footman, Coachman, Valet, Upper and Under House-Maids, Lady's-Maid, Maid-of-all-Work, Laundry-Maid, Nurse and Nurse-Maid, Monthly Wet and Sick Nurses, etc. etc.\u2014also Sanitary, Medical, & Legal Memoranda: with a History of the Origin, Properties, and Uses of all Things Connected with Home Life and Comfort.\nIn its preface she wrote:\nI must frankly own, that if I had known, beforehand, that this book would have cost me the labour which it has, I should never have been courageous enough to commence it. What moved me, in the first instance, to attempt a work like this, was the discomfort and suffering which I had seen brought upon men and women by household mismanagement. I have always thought that there is no more fruitful source of family discontent than a housewife's badly-cooked dinners and untidy ways.\nBeeton's half-sister, Lucy Smiles, was later asked about her memories of the book's development. She recalled:\nDifferent people gave their recipes for the book. That for Baroness pudding (a suet pudding with a plethora of raisins) was given by the Baroness de Tessier, who lived at Epsom. No recipe went into the book without a successful trial, and the home at Pinner was the scene of many experiments and some failures. I remember Isabella coming out of the kitchen one day, 'This won't do at all,' she said, and gave me the cake that had turned out like a biscuit. I thought it very good. It had currants in it.\nPreviously published as a part-work, it was first published as a book in 1861 by S. O. Beeton Publishing, 161 Bouverie Street, London, a firm founded by Samuel Beeton.\nThe book was an immediate best-seller, selling 60,000 copies in its first year and totalling nearly two million by 1868. In 2010 a copy of the first edition of Household Management in \"top condition\" was stated to be worth more than \u00a31,000. In 1863 a revised edition was issued.\nIn 1866, a year after Isabella's death, Samuel was in debt due to the collapse of Overend and Gurney, a London discount house to which he owed money. To save himself from bankruptcy he sold the copyright to all of his publications for a little over \u00a319,000. Of that, the rights to Household Management were sold to publishers Ward, Lock and Tyler for \u00a33,250. The early editions included an obituary notice for Beeton, but the publishers insisted it be removed \"allowing readers to imagine \u2013 perhaps even as late as 1915 \u2013 that some mob-capped matriarch was out there still keeping an eye on them\".\nRevisions to Household Management by its publisher have continued to the present day. The effort has kept the Beeton name in the public eye for over 125 years, although current editions are far removed from those published in Mrs. Beeton's lifetime. By 1906 the book had 2,056 pages, \"exclusive of advertising\", with 3,931 recipes and was \"half as large again\" as the previous edition.\n\nThe following description refers to the 1907 edition; the book was greatly extended in the decades since Mrs. Beeton's death (in 1865) to 74 chapters and over 2000 pages; the first edition had 44 chapters.\nThe book begins with general chapters on the duties of the \"mistress\", the housekeeper, and the cook. There follow chapters on the kitchen itself, \"marketing\" (choosing good-quality produce at the market), and an introduction to cookery (Chapter 6). Together, these take up over 100 pages. Chapters 7 to 38 (roughly 1000 pages) cover English cooking, with recipes for soups, gravies, fish, meat (principally veal, beef, mutton and lamb, and pork), poultry, game, preserves, vegetables, pastries, puddings, sweets, jams, pickles, and savouries. Chapter 39 describes the \"art of carving at table\", supported by 11 illustrations. Chapters 40 to 50 (some 200 pages) give instructions for dairy products, vegetarian and invalid (sick person) cookery, making bread, biscuits and cakes, and beverages. Chapters 51 to 59 describe cooking in various international styles including French, German, Spanish, Jewish, Australian, South African, Indian, American and Canadian cookery. Chapters 60 to 68 provide guidance on matters from trussing poultry to the definitions of culinary terms, arranging meals,"

The first <Megamorphs> book was covered by the thirteenth episode, \"The Forgotten\", which is the name of the eleventh book in the series (the TV episode bears no resemblance to its namesake book). The TV episodes did not follow the books faithfully, altering many aspects of the characters' roles within the Animorphs, the events in the war against the Yeerks, and added plot lines that were not present in the books.

At the time it was written, the novel represented a shift by Scott away from writing novels set in Scotland in the fairly recent past to a more fanciful depiction of England in the Middle Ages. Ivanhoe proved to be one of the best-known and most influential of Scott's novels. Set in 12th-century England, with colourful descriptions of a tournament, outlaws, a witch trial, and divisions between Jews and Christians, Ivanhoe is credited for increased interest in chivalric romance and medievalism. ...",

(London). release_date: 1820 (released December 1819). series: Waverley Novels. In June 1819, Walter Scott still suffered from the severe stomach pains that had forced him to dictate the last part of The Bride of Lammermoor, and also most of A Legend of the Wars of Montrose, which he finished at the end of May. By the beginning of July, at the latest, Scott had started dictating his new novel Ivanhoe, again with John Ballantyne and William Laidlaw as amanuenses. For the second half of the manuscript, Scott was able to take up the pen, and completed Ivanhoe: A Romance in early November 1819.\nFor detailed information about the Middle Ages Scott drew on three works by the antiquarian Joseph Strutt: Horda Angel-cynnan or a Compleat View of the Manners, Customs, Arms, Habits etc. of the Inhabitants of England (1775\u201376), Dress and Habits of the People of England (1796\u201399), and Sports and Pastimes of the People of England (1801). Two historians gave him a solid grounding in the period: Robert Henry with The History of Great Britain (1771\u201393), and Sharon Turner with The History of the Anglo-Saxons from the Earliest Period to the Norman Conquest (1799\u20131805). His clearest debt to an original medieval source involved the Templar Rule, reproduced in The Theatre of Honour and Knight-Hood (1623) translated from the French of Andr\u00e9 Favine. Scott was happy to introduce details from the later Middle Ages, and Chaucer was particularly helpful, as (in a different way) was the fourteenth-century romance Richard Coeur de Lion.\nIvanhoe was published by Archibald Constable in Edinburgh. All first editions carry the date of 1820, but it was released on 20 December 1819 and issued in London on the 29th by Hurst, Robinson and Co.. As with all of the Waverley novels before 1827, publication was anonymous. The print run was 10,000 copies, and the cost was \u00a31 10s (\u00a31.50, equivalent in purchasing power to \u00a3149 in 2021). It is possible that Scott was involved in minor changes to the text during the early 1820s but his main revision was carried out in 1829 for the 'Magnum' edition where the novel appeared in Volumes 16 and 17 in September and October 1830.\nThe standard modern edition, by Graham Tulloch, appeared as Volume 8 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 1998: this is based on the first edition with emendations principally from Scott's manuscript in the second half of the work; the new Magnum material is included in Volume 25b.\nIvanhoe is the story of one of the remaining Anglo-Saxon noble families at a time when the nobility in England was overwhelmingly Norman. It follows the Saxon protagonist, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favour with his father for his allegiance to the Norman king Richard the Lionheart. The story is set in 1194, after the failure of the Third Crusade, when many of the Crusaders were still returning to their homes in Europe. King Richard, who had been captured by Leopold of Austria on his return journey to England, was believed to still be in captivity.\n\nProtagonist Wilfred of Ivanhoe is disinherited by his father Cedric of Rotherwood for supporting the Norman King Richard and for falling in love with the Lady Rowena, a ward of Cedric and descendant of the Saxon Kings of England. Cedric planned to have Rowena marry the powerful Lord Athelstane, a pretender to the Crown of England by his descent from the last Saxon King, Harold Godwinson. Ivanhoe accompanies King Richard on the Crusades, where he is said to have played a notable role in the Siege of Acre; and tends to Louis of Thuringia, who suffers from malaria.\nThe book opens with a scene of Norman knights and prelates seeking the hospitality of Cedric. They are guided there by a pilgrim, known at that time as a palmer. Also returning from the Holy Land that same night, Isaac of York, a Jewish moneylender, seeks refuge at Rotherwood. Following the night's meal, the palmer observes one of the Normans, the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, issue orders to his Saracen soldiers to capture Isaac.\nThe palmer then assists in Isaac's escape from Rotherwood, with the additional aid of the swineherd Gurth.\nIsaac of York offers to repay his debt to the palmer with a suit of armour and a war horse to participate in the tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouch Castle, on his inference that the palmer was secretly a knight. The palmer is taken by surprise, but accepts the offer.\nThe tournament is presided over by Prince John. Also in attendance are Cedric, Athelstane, Lady Rowena, Isaac of York, his daughter Rebecca, Robin of Locksley and his"

Night Work (German: Die Arbeit der Nacht) is a 2006 novel by Austrian writer Thomas Glavinic. The book was translated into English in 2008 by John Brownjohn for Edinburgh-based publisher Canongate.\nThe UK edition received a generally positive reception from critics. The Guardian referred to the book as being \u201cat times genuinely horrific\u201d because of the author\u2019s skill in manipulating the \u201creader's constant anxiety that [he] won't, indeed can't, deliver a solution to his own mystery\u201d. The Independent claimed that the novel, \u201cfunctions both as an outstanding fictionalisation of Freud's essay The Uncanny, and as a superior literary thriller packed with invention and suspense\u201d. The Scotland on Sunday said it was \u201cstrong on intrigue\u201d and \u201cseriously frightening\u201d.\nGlavinic, Thomas (2008-07-25), Night Work (1st ed.), Edinburgh: Canongate ISBN\u00a0978-1-84767-051-9\n\"Review: I am legend\".

A group in a local Waitrose supermarket, led by a boy named Arran and his second-in-command, a girl named Maxie, grows increasingly frustrated as children are kidnapped and killed by infected adults, who are becoming smarter. A scavenger party, composed of Arran, a short-fused fighter named Achilleus, a slingshot marksman named Ollie, and best friends Freak and Deke, becomes trapped by infected adults while exploring a building. During the ensuing fight, Deke is killed when his lung is punctured by a shard of glass, and Arran is bitten by a zombie he believes to be his mother. The bite sickens him, and the group barely escapes. Achilleus blames Deke's death on Freak (as it was his idea to search the building), sending Freak into depression.\nLater that night, they save a boy named Jester from a large pack of zombies, prompting him to invite the group to his home, Buckingham Palace, which he claims is safe. The majority of the group likes the idea and set off through Camden to the palace, along with another group of kids from a nearby Morrisons supermarket, led by Blue and his second-in-command Whitney. A loner named Callum, stays behind on his own, afraid to leave the confines of his base. \nMeanwhile, Small Sam, a young boy who was kidnapped earlier by adults (leading the rest of the Waitrose crew to believe he is dead), awakens in a zombie nesting ground at Emirates Stadium. He escapes the stadium by setting it on fire, along the way encountering a father wearing a Saint George T-shirt, who is in control of the rest of the stadium zombies. Sam flees to Waitrose, where Callum explains that the other children left for Buckingham Palace. He is unable to catch up with them, eventually heading down into the subway tunnels where he is swarmed by a group of zombies. He is saved by an apparently uninfected man named Nick, who takes him to the subway car which he and his also uninfected wife Rachel are using as a home. Due to exhaustion, Sam eventually falls asleep.\nAs they are making their way to the palace, the Waitrose and Morrisons children (Now called the Holloway kids after the road both shops were on) are met by a large army of zombies, led by the Saint George zombie Sam saw earlier. In the resulting fight, Arran and Maxie discover they are attracted to each other, a secret they both kept for fear of the other person not feeling the same way. The Holloway children eventually force the zombie army into a retreat, but Arran's bite causes him to go insane and chase after them. He is mistaken for a zombie by a girl named Sophie (Leader of a group of archers) and she shoots him in the chest with a bow and arrow. Despite her attempts to save him, Arran eventually dies in Maxie's arms (much to her grief).\nMeanwhile, Sam wakes up inside a different train car, chained to the wall with a group of other children. Nick enters and reveals that although he believes he and Rachel are not infected, they are still cannibals, and intent on eating Sam. When he leaves, another small child (who simply refers to himself as \" The Kid\") enters the car via a window and helps Sam escape, along with another girl named Rhiannon (although the rest believe Nick wants to help them, and stay behind to be devoured). They are chased by Nick through the subway tunnels during which Rhiannon is shot until they end up outside and Nick corners Sam underneath a car. Just as he is about to kill Sam, the sun comes out, and Nick (who is revealed to be infected along with Rachel) rapidly accelerates in infection due to the amount of time he has spent underground. He eventually swells and bursts, which kills him instantly. Sam and the Kid escape into the streets, developing a friendship in the process.\nWhilst the Holloway children continue on to the palace, Maxie develops a hatred for Sophie (who has decided to join them along with her group), blaming her for Arran's death. She is now the new leader of the Waitrose children and struggles under the pressure of having responsibility for every kid in her group. Blue attempts to help her before the group is ambushed by a pack of infected chimpanzees that have escaped a nearby zoo. They kill many small children, as well as Maxie's newly appointed right-hand man Josh, devastating"

The Bioscope Man is the third novel of Indian author Indrajit Hazra. It is set in Calcutta and stitches early 20th century Indian cultural and cinema history with the farcical story of Abani Chatterjee to conduct a darkly comic investigation of the phenomena of pretending, lying and acting. It was published by Penguin Books India on May 1, 2008, and was translated into French the following year by Marc Amfreville.

There is no denying that Hazra\u2019s third novel is as much a paean to Calcutta as it is to cinema, but refreshingly, it is never sentimental, crisscrossed as it is continually by an incisive, rigorous irony of vision and verbal play that serves to remind us that the city, somewhat like the pictures that it throws up on celluloid, is at least partially what we make of it\u2014or make up about it.\"\nMadhu Jain of the Hindustan Times wrote, \"While the author has woven many themes into the novel - a critique of Orientalism, a portrait of the Bengali bhadralok in Victorian India, self-deception, the birth and infancy of silent movies - it is the marvellously drawn portrait of the actor whose rapid rise and fall marks him. The actor's reflections upon his life and work are riveting.\"\nThe Book Review magazine praised Hazra's craft of telling a powerful story and his use of English language in a creative and artistic manner in its review of The Bioscope Man. \"The Bioscope Man is the longest and most ambitious of his three books,\" the magazine wrote, \"but Hazra does not disappoint. Far from it. In fact, he proves without a doubt that this country can produce English writers in whose hands the language is a hundred-eyed beast, shimmering with myriad coloured scales, tamed and trained to turn reading into a fast moving motion of coherently flowing images....Hazra should be read for his prose alone. But he also knows how to tell a meaty story with deft techniques... The Bioscope Man is a ragingly powerful story.\"\nThe French translation of the novel was reviewed on the La PAL D'Heclea literary blog. The blog said, \"Moi qui aime, par moments, sortir de ma zone de confort (comprendre les romans policiers, les thrillers et de temps en temps de la fantasy), on peut dire que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 on ne peut plus g\u00e2t\u00e9e!

The narrative works its way back through history in search of answers to the problems of the present.

The book contains short works of fiction and poetry by the author, together with an introduction by fellow science fiction writer Poul Anderson.\n\"L. Sprague de Camp \u2014 Engineer and Sorcerer\" by Poul Anderson.\n\"Hyperpilosity\". An apparent plague makes people grow bodily hair similar to that of Gorillas. Virologists Oliveira and Weiss attempt to find a cure amid large-scale societal changes happening around them.\n\"Language for Time Travelers\" (essay). De Camp explores an issue hitherto ignored by writers of time-travel fiction; the barriers to communication in the eras visited by time-travelers posed by natural language change. Examples of the difficulties involved are humorously explored through the fictional tribulations of one such traveler confronted with various linguistic scenarios.\n\"The Command\". Uplifted bear Johnny Black discovers the scientists who have granted him human intelligence have been reduced by a mysterious disease to automatons, unable to function except in response to direct orders. Johnny is equal to taking out the would-be world conqueror responsible, but curing the victims proves problematic\u2014he has the counter-agent, but his bear paws can't inject it, and with his bear vocal chords can't order them to do so themselves. If he can't figure out a solution, the plague will spread world-wide, and humanity is doomed.\n\"The Merman\". Vernon Brock is a biologist who experiments with turning lungs into gills. After accidentally performing the transformation on himself, he is stuck underwater, unable to communicate, and attempts to resolve the situation using his limited knowledge.\n\"Employment\". Paleontologist and inventor Gilmore Platt has devised a method of restoring fossil animals to life, causing difficulties for his assistant-turned zookeeper Kenneth Staples\u2014particularly after Mr. Nively, representing the country's animal importers, shoots their mammoth to shut down the competition from these prehistoric resurrectionists. It only makes the mammoth mad... If Staples can't handle the situation he may be out of a job.\n\"The Gnarly Man\". Shining Hawk, a Neanderthal man rendered ageless by a lightning strike, has survived into modern times by keeping a low profile. Currently posting as one Clarence Gaffney, he is found out by scientist Matilda Sandler, at whose urging he warily agrees to submit to medical examination in return for surgery to correct some old injuries. But when Sandler develops a romantic interest in him and the prospective surgeon is discovered plotting to dissect him to achieve medical fame, Gaffney bolts.\n\"Reward of Virtue\" (poem).\n\"Nothing in the Rules\". Accusations of foul play ensue when a mermaid is entered at a swim meet, but the stratagem appears perfectly legal. No such ploy ever having been envisioned, it turns out that nothing in the rules states a contestant can't have a tail, or even has to be human...\n\"The Hardwood Pile\". When Dan Pringle's Gahato sawmill processes a tree harboring a dryad, the spirit, having no other home, remains with the resulting pile of lumber, \"haunting\" it to prevent its dispersal. A running conflict between the two ensues, ending only when Pringle agrees to sell the whole pile to renovate the dance floor of a local bar, at which his antagonist then becomes an employee.\n\"The Reluctant Shaman\". Indian curio-shop proprietor Virgil Hathaway gets stuck babysitting a batch of mischievous Iroquois spirits, who get out of control and run rampant \"helping\" people with poltergeist-style tricks. Only a medicine man can bring them to heel, but is Hathaway up to the task?\n\"The Inspector's Teeth\". Hithafea, a dinosaur-like native from the planet Osiris enrolls in an Earth college and pledges one of its fraternities. Snobbish big man on campus John Fitzgerald, resenting Hithafea, hazes him mercilessly. But how does this connect with the fate of an interstellar treaty negotiated many years later?\n\"The Guided Man\". The Telagog Company can take over your body for you in awkward social situations, enabling you to negotiate them effortlessly. The service is a godsend for bashful Ovid Ross, until his controller decides he wants the same girl Ovid does...\n\"The Ameba\" (poem).\n\"Judgment Day\". Physicist Wade Ormont discovers an unsuspected type of nuclear reaction that could make his reputation\u2014and, in the wrong hands, lead inevitably to universal destruction. Should he publish his findings and bask in the ephemeral glory, or does the survival of a world that has rejected and despised him count"

The Incorporated Knight is a fix-up fantasy novel by American writers L. Sprague de Camp and Catherine Crook de Camp, the first book in their sequence of two Neo-Napolitanian novels. Chapters 1-5 first appeared as L. Sprague de Camp's short stories \"Two Yards of Dragon\", \"The Coronet\", \"Spider Love\" and \"Eudoric's Unicorn\" in Flashing Swords!, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and The Year's Best Fantasy Stories in 1976-1977. The complete novel was first published in hardcover by Phantasia Press in August 1987, and in paperback by Baen Books in September 1988, with a trade paperback edition, also from Baen, following in 1991. An E-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.\nThe Incorporated Knight and its sequel The Pixilated Peeress are both set in the medieval era of an alternate world sharing the geography of our own, but in which a \"Napolitanian\" (Neapolitan) empire filled the role of Rome and no universal religion like Christianity ever arose, leaving its nations split among competing pagan sects. The New Napolitanian Empire, of which Eudoric is a subject, roughly corresponds to our world's Holy Roman Empire, or Germany, while Franconia and Armoria, the lands he visits to the west, are the equivalents of France and Brittany, respectively. The geography of more eastern regions such as Pathenia and Pantorozia are borrowed in part from the fanciful regions portrayed in Mandeville's Travels; the time-period corresponds to the historical 14th century. In keeping with the character of de Camp's fantasy world as a cognate of our own, its place names tend to echo those of the real world. Examples include Franconia, equating to France but derived from the historic German region of the same name; Armoria, based on Armorica, an ancient name for Brittany; Serica, an ancient name for China or Xinjiang; Sogrambrium, the capital of the New Napolitanian Empire, derived from the Sicrambri or Sugambri, an ancient Germanic tribe located on the east bank of the Rhine near the present border of Germany and the Netherlands; and Letitia, the capital of Franconia, a variation on Lutetia, the ancient name of Paris.\nReviews were favorable. Publishers Weekly, noting that \"[t]he hallmark of Sprague de Camp's classic fantasy has been a wry humor as he asked commonsensical questions of the genre's imaginative but impractical motifs,\" called this book, \"the adventures of ... a knight whose only goals are a wife and a decent living,\" \"[m]inor de Camp but still most enjoyable,\"  Jackie Cassada, writing for Library Journal, praised its \"doughty and resourceful hero and ... generous dollop of the de Camps' boisterous humor.\"  Roland Green, in The Booklist, called the book \"a pleasant fantasy romp,\" noting that while it was \"likely to be released in paperback in due time,\" its \"high quality definitely makes [it] worth considering in hardcover.\"\nThe book was also reviewed by Trevin Matlock in Locus no. 320, September 1987, and Darrell Schweitzer  in Aboriginal Science Fiction, November-December 1987.\nThe main plot device of bickering male and female protagonists not destined for a happy ending together is featured in several late de Camp novels, notably The Prisoner of Zhamanak (1982), The Bones of Zora (1983), and The Pixilated Peeress (1991).\nLaughlin, Charlotte; Daniel J.

It was originally published in 1902 in the Strand Magazine under the general title The Psammead, or the Gifts, with a segment appearing each month from April to December. The stories were then expanded into a novel which was published the same year. It is the first volume of a trilogy that includes The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904) and The Story of the Amulet (1906). The book has never been out of print since its initial publication.\nThe five children are brothers and sisters:\nCyril, known as Squirrel: the eldest sibling, who is brave, diplomatic, and book-smart (very intelligent)\nAnthea, known as Panther: the second eldest, who is kind, sensible, and good-hearted.\nRobert, known as Bobs: the middle child, he is a practical joker with a quick temper.\nJane, known as Pussy: a generally agreeable little girl with a tendency to be oversensitive, she is sometimes weepy and easily frightened.\nHilary, the baby, known as the Lamb (because his first word was \"baa\"). He is too young to have much of a personality.\n\"It\" is the Psammead, a grumpy, ancient, wish-granting fairy who causes trouble for the children but nevertheless grows fond of them.\nIn Five Children and It, the Psammead is described as having \"eyes [that] were on long horns like a snail's eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes; it had ears like a bat's ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a spider's and covered with thick soft fur; its legs and arms were furry too, and it had hands and feet like a monkey's\" and whiskers like a rat's. When it grants wishes it stretches out its eyes, holds its breath and swells alarmingly.\nThe five children find the Psammead in a gravel-pit, which used to be seashore. There were once many Psammeads, but the others died because they got cold and wet. It is the only one of its kind left. It is thousands of years old, and remembers pterodactyls and other ancient creatures. When the Psammeads were around they granted wishes that were then mostly for food. The wished-for objects turned into stone at sunset if they were not used that day, but this does not apply to the children's wishes because what they wish for is so much more fantastic than the wishes the Psammead granted in the past. \nThe word \"Psammead\", pronounced \"sammyadd\" by the children in the story, appears to be a coinage by Nesbit from the Greek \u03c8\u03ac\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \"sand\" after the pattern of dryad, naiad and oread, implicitly signifying \"sand-nymph\". However, its hideous appearance is very unlike traditional Greek nymphs, who generally resemble beautiful young maidens.\nThe character was notably played in three BBC Television serials of the 1990s by the puppeteer Francis Wright.\nThe book's ending was clearly intended to leave readers in suspense:\n\"They did see it [the Psammead] again, of course, but not in this story. And it was not in a sand-pit either, but in a very, very, very different place. It was in a\u00a0\u2013 But I must say no more.\"\nThe children reappear in The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904) and then in The Story of the Amulet (1906). The Psammead is offstage in the first of these sequels (it is simply mentioned by the Phoenix, who visits it three times to ask for a helpful wish when the situation becomes difficult), but it plays a significant role in the second sequel after the children rescue it from a pet shop.\nSome fifty years later the premise of Five Children and It inspired the plot of Half Magic (1954) by Edward Eager, an American author of children's books.\nThe Return of the Psammead (1992) by Helen Cresswell concerns another family of Edwardian children who discover the Psammead.\nFour Children and It (2012) by Jacqueline Wilson is a contemporary version of the story in which four children from a modern stepfamily encounter the Psammead. One of the children has read the original book and wishes to meet Cyril, Anthea, Jane and Robert.\nIn Five Children on the Western Front (2014) by Kate Saunders, set nine years after the original story, the five children encounter the horrors of the First World War.\nFive Children and It has been adapted for television and film several times:\nIn 1985\u201386 NHK broadcast a Japanese anime version, Onegai! Samia-don, 78 episodes were produced by animation studio TMS. No English dubbed version was ever produced, but it came out in other languages.\nIn 1991 the BBC turned the story into a six-part television series. It was released in the UK under the story's original title, but in the USA it was released as The Sand Fairy. This was followed by The Return of the Psammead in 1993, with the"

He is too young to have much of a personality.\n\"It\" is the Psammead, a grumpy, ancient, wish-granting fairy who causes trouble for the children but nevertheless grows fond of them.\nIn Five Children and It, the Psammead is described as having \"eyes [that] were on long horns like a snail's eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes; it had ears like a bat's ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a spider's and covered with thick soft fur; its legs and arms were furry too, and it had hands and feet like a monkey's\" and whiskers like a rat's. When it grants wishes it stretches out its eyes, holds its breath and swells alarmingly.\nThe five children find the Psammead in a gravel-pit, which used to be seashore. There were once many Psammeads, but the others died because they got cold and wet. It is the only one of its kind left. It is thousands of years old, and remembers pterodactyls and other ancient creatures. When the Psammeads were around they granted wishes that were then mostly for food. The wished-for objects turned into stone at sunset if they were not used that day, but this does not apply to the children's wishes because what they wish for is so much more fantastic than the wishes the Psammead granted in the past. \nThe word \"Psammead\", pronounced \"sammyadd\" by the children in the story, appears to be a coinage by Nesbit from the Greek \u03c8\u03ac\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \"sand\" after the pattern of dryad, naiad and oread, implicitly signifying \"sand-nymph\". However, its hideous appearance is very unlike traditional Greek nymphs, who generally resemble beautiful young maidens.\nThe character was notably played in three BBC Television serials of the 1990s by the puppeteer Francis Wright.\nThe book's ending was clearly intended to leave readers in suspense:\n\"They did see it [the Psammead] again, of course, but not in this story. And it was not in a sand-pit either, but in a very, very, very different place. It was in a\u00a0\u2013 But I must say no more.\"\nThe children reappear in The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904) and then in The Story of the Amulet (1906). The Psammead is offstage in the first of these sequels (it is simply mentioned by the Phoenix, who visits it three times to ask for a helpful wish when the situation becomes difficult), but it plays a significant role in the second sequel after the children rescue it from a pet shop.\nSome fifty years later the premise of Five Children and It inspired the plot of Half Magic (1954) by Edward Eager, an American author of children's books.\nThe Return of the Psammead (1992) by Helen Cresswell concerns another family of Edwardian children who discover the Psammead.\nFour Children and It (2012) by Jacqueline Wilson is a contemporary version of the story in which four children from a modern stepfamily encounter the Psammead. One of the children has read the original book and wishes to meet Cyril, Anthea, Jane and Robert.\nIn Five Children on the Western Front (2014) by Kate Saunders, set nine years after the original story, the five children encounter the horrors of the First World War.\nFive Children and It has been adapted for television and film several times:\nIn 1985\u201386 NHK broadcast a Japanese anime version, Onegai! Samia-don, 78 episodes were produced by animation studio TMS. No English dubbed version was ever produced, but it came out in other languages.\nIn 1991 the BBC turned the story into a six-part television series. It was released in the UK under the story's original title, but in the USA it was released as The Sand Fairy. This was followed by The Return of the Psammead in 1993, with the"

In the other two volumes, circumstances have forced the children to spend protracted periods away from their home and their father. A continuing theme throughout The Phoenix and the Carpet is the element of fire. The story begins shortly before 5 November, celebrated in Britain as Guy Fawkes Night, when people build bonfires and set off fireworks. ...",

The Phoenix and the Carpet is a fantasy novel for children, written by E. Nesbit and first published in 1904. It is the second in a trilogy of novels that begins with Five Children and It (1902), and follows the adventures of the same five children: Cyril, Anthea, Robert, Jane and the Lamb. Their mother buys the children a new carpet to replace one from the nursery that they have destroyed in an accidental fire. The children find an egg in the carpet, which hatches into a talking Phoenix. The Phoenix explains that the carpet is a magic one that will grant them three wishes a day. The five children go on many adventures, which eventually wear out their magic carpet. The adventures are continued and concluded in the third book of the trilogy, The Story of the Amulet (1906).\nChapter One: \"The Egg\"\nWhen their old carpet is destroyed by their fireworks, the siblings get a new nursery carpet and discover a mysterious egg wrapped within it. Robert accidentally rolls the egg into the fire and out hatches the Phoenix, who tells the tale of the magic carpet.\nChapter Two: \"Topless Tower\"\nThe children go on their first adventure with the carpet and the Phoenix and while they discover treasure they also learn the limitations of the carpet and must get rescued by the Psammead's wish fulfilling abilities.\nChapter Three: \"The Queen Cook\"\nWhile on an adventure to cure the Lamb of whooping cough, the children are forced by circumstances to take along their cook. Once they are on a sunny tropical island, the Cook is thought to be a queen by the natives living on the island and is content to be left behind.\nChapter Four: \"Two Bazaars\"\nThe children go on an adventure with the carpet to India so they can find items for their mother can sell in her Bazaar, although matters are briefly complicated when the carpet is sold as well.\nChapter Five: \"The Temple\"\nAfter helping the children change the weather to permit an adventure, the Phoenix asks them to take him to one of his temples. At the \"temple\", the children and the Phoenix are honoured guests of a ceremony to celebrate the Phoenix, yet once they leave, all the gentlemen believe it to have been a dream.\nChapter Six: \"Doing Good\"\nThe carpet takes the children abroad to do a good deed; they meet a sad French family and return their family treasure to them (the treasure discovered in Chapter 2).\nChapter Seven: \"Mews from Persia\"\nThe children are meant to meet their aunt at the train station, but Robert forgot to send his mother's instructions for the aunt to meet them. The children go home alone and break into their own home. The carpet wants to visit its homeland, so the children let it go and the carpet brings back 199 Persian cats.\nChapter Eight: \"The Cats, the Cow and the Burglar\"\nThe carpet takes away the musk-rats it had brought as food for the cats and brings a cow instead. Jane confronts a burglar, finds him kind, and gives him the cats to sell.\nChapter Nine: \"The Burglar\u2019s Bride\"\nThe burglar has been arrested for allegedly stealing Persian cats, but the children rescue him and bring him to the tropical island where their former cook reigns as queen.  The cook and the burglar like each other, and the carpet is sent to fetch a clergyman to marry them.\nChapter Ten: \"The Hole in the Carpet\"\nDespite the damaged state of the carpet, the children desire to go on one more adventure before their mother returns. Robert and Jane fall through a hole in the carpet, which continues on and takes Cyril and Anthea to their Uncle Reginald. Jane and Robert fall into a house and meet the clergyman who married the cook and burglar, but they are rescued by the Phoenix getting help from the Psammead.\nChapter Eleven: \"The Beginning of the End\"\nThe children go to the theatre with the Phoenix. Believing the theatre to be its own temple, the Phoenix flies around and starts a fire. The carpet brings the children home safely and the Phoenix uses its powers to reverse the damage.\nChapter Twelve: \"The End of The End\"\nThe Phoenix begins to age and announces it must soon leave. It lays its egg and is consumed by fire. What remains of the carpet is given to the Psammead, who in return grants the Phoenix's last wish: to send the children all the toys they have ever wanted.\nMain characters:\nCyril \u2013 the oldest of the five children. He is nicknamed Squirrel. Cyril often takes on the role of leader and is sensible and level-headed. He is also the main decision-maker for the children. Although his decisions are sometimes challenged, he often has the final say in what the children do. Between the two older boys,"

Intending to write about the small beach town's local flavor and unusual death rituals, Lea Sutter travels to Cape Le Chat Noir for her travel blog. Her plans are shattered when a terrible hurricane decimates the town, killing off most of its inhabitants. The experience shakes Lea, spurring her to take Daniel and Samuel, two twelve-year-old twin orphans, home with her. Lea's decision doesn't sit well with her husband Mark, who has been experiencing stress over the backlash for his recent child psychology book. He finds Daniel and Samuel to be strange, especially after they demand that his sister Roz move out of the guest house so they can live there. Their strangeness also stands out to Lea and Mark's children Elena and Ira, who find it hard to trust Daniel and Samuel. Lea insists that their behaviors are due to PTSD and enrolls them at the local school. Meanwhile, Daniel and Samuel have begun stealing various objects from people around them as well as using their unusual supernatural powers to intimidate and control the people around them.\nKnowing that Mark doesn't trust them, the twins frame him for multiple murders in the hopes that it will get rid of Mark. The plan initially works, but eventually backfires when Daniel and Samuel take control of many of the local children. With the help of a woman named Martha Swann from Cape Le Chat Noir, Lea realizes that the twins are actually the product of a failed ritual to reanimate the dead in the 1930s. Lea also realizes that she herself was a product of a similar, separate ritual, having died during the hurricane during her visit to Cape Le Chat Noir. Lea manages to stop the twins and save her family, but at the cost of her own existence. The book ends with Mark and his sister Roz looking on in horror as they watch her son Axl use similar powers as Daniel and Samuel, claiming that they taught him a trick.\nStine began writing Red Rain after his adult readers, having grown up reading his Goosebumps and Fear Street books, began asking him to write a book for them. An outline for the novel was approved by Stacy Creamer, the vice president and publisher for Touchstone, and the book took him four months to write. Stine commented that he normally did not have to do research for his children's books, whereas he did for Red Rain and that he found the writing process more challenging than his other books. He also found that he didn't come up with the title until he had completed writing, where he usually comes up with the titles first for his children's books. He read content such as Sir James George Frazer's book The Golden Bough and he was inspired by Frazer's assertion that some tribes believed that twins controlled the weather. He was fascinated by the additional knowledge that blood rain was a real phenomenon, often seen as a bad omen by many cultures. Stine also had to perform research on the book's setting, as he had never been to that location. While writing Red Rain, Stine watched Village of the Damned, Island of the Damned and Children of the Damned.\nCritical reception for Red Rain was mixed. Positive notices include:\n\"Stine has a freshly terrifying story to tell, and he tells it with gusto, ratcheting up the chills until we're frozen in our chairs. Parents, be warned: this is emphatically not for younger readers.\" - Booklist\n\"It's a page turner until the end, with short chapters that help increase the pace. Stine enjoys himself writing not for kids but about them.\" - Associated Press</ref>\n\"Stine's story is a creepy, fun read.\" - Library Journal\n\"With this brilliantly written novel ... Stine proves that he definitely has it in him to challenge the greats in the thriller/horror genre. . . . Think Dean Koontz, Douglas Preston, Harlan Coben and then amp it up by a hundred!\" - MysteryNet.com\nHowever, negative response included The A.V. Club criticizing it as mediocre. Trade reviews for the book were ambivalent, with the Library Journal remarking that \"the whole thing is slapdash\". Slate's Katy Waldman commented that Red Rain was too controlled and bogged down in detail, and that the novel's dominant tone was \"elegiac rather than exciting\", explaining: \"Passages linger over the aftermath of destruction\u2014a house\u2019s splintered remains, a charred body\u2014rather than the unwinding blow of it.\"\nIn contrast, The Huffington Post named Red Rain one of their best books for fall 2012.\n\"Red Rain\".

The book opens in 2008 in a prison hospital. Charles Talent Manx III, a convicted child abductor, briefly wakes from a coma to threaten a nurse. When the nurse informs her coworkers, they dismiss her claim as false, since Manx has exhibited only limited brain function for years.\nThe perspective changes to eight-year-old Victoria \u201cVic\u201d McQueen in 1986. Vic discovers that she can find lost things by riding her bicycle through a particular covered bridge near her home in Massachusetts, which will transport her to the location of whatever she is seeking. Vic soon discovers that each trip through this \"Shorter Way\" Bridge exacts an increasing mental and physical toll on her. In order to prevent people from thinking her crazy or a liar, Vic must come up with excuses to explain how she is always able to find things. On one trip through the Shorter Way, she travels to an Iowa library where she meets Maggie Leigh, a librarian who can use Scrabble tiles to gain information about future events. Maggie warns Vic about Manx, whose name she does not know, so she refers to him as \"the Wraith\" after the model of the car he drives. Vic travels home, but loses her bike and, as a result of using the Shorter Way, develops a terrible fever. Manx continues to kidnap children and enlists chemical plant worker Bing Partridge to steal a supply of gingerbread-scented sevoflurane from his workplace. Manx has been taking the children he abducts to a place called \"Christmasland\" where they can be happy forever. Bing assists him by using the sevoflurane (which he calls \"gingerbread smoke\") to incapacitate the children's parents before raping and killing them.\nIn 1996, 18-year-old Vic has a fight with her mother about her parents' separation and uses the Shorter Way to flee from home to her estranged father. She pleads with her father to let her stay with him, but he refuses, sending her away. Vic follows the Shorter Way to Sleigh House, Manx's residence in Colorado, thinking that if she is abducted it will hurt her mother, and make her sorry. Upon arrival, she finds a child locked in the back of Manx's Wraith and attempts to rescue him. Vic soon finds out, however, that the child is apparently in league with Manx. The child becomes monstrous, with rows of sharp brown teeth and cold mist spewing from his nose. Vic takes refuge in Manx's house but is soon forced to flee when Manx arrives. Vic manages to escape Sleigh House at the last moment through a laundry chute, after setting it on fire. She runs into overweight motorcyclist Lou Carmody, who takes her to a gas station to call the police. Manx arrives at the same station to purchase gas and is captured by the police after he attacks Vic sets fire to a serviceman. Vic does not tell the police about the Shorter Way of what happened at Sleigh House, and they assume that Manx had kidnapped her and brought her to Colorado.\nVic accidentally goes to Maggie through the Shorter Way. Maggie explains that they are both \"creatives\" who have the special ability to access \"in-scapes\" outside of the normal world. Both of their in-scapes come with a balance, though. For Vic, it is the fever she gets when using the Shorter Way, for Maggie it is a stutter that gets worse whenever she uses the tiles.\nThe story returns to 2008. An adult Vic is in a relationship with Lou and given has birth to a son, Bruce Wayne Carmody. Unhappy and scarred by the past, she restores motorcycles and develops a successful series of children's books. Vic begins to be harassed by phone calls from Christmasland's vampire children, who chastise her for Manx's arrest and threaten that Wayne will join them soon. Vic's torment drives her to insanity and destroys her relationship with Lou. Eventually, they part ways and she recovers after a stay in a psychiatric hospital.\nBy 2012, Vic is again living in Massachusetts, in a house inherited from her now-deceased mother. Maggie appears on her doorstep one day with news that that Manx died in prison, resurrected himself, and then escaped. Vic refuses to believe Maggie and sends her away. Meanwhile, Manx reunites with Bing and they resume their abduction of children.

He received the name \"Brokenclaw\" because of a deformity in his left hand where his thumb is on the right (viewing the palm up) rather than the left. Brokenclaw is a crime lord in San Francisco who has a large hold on the city's prostitution, gambling, and drug rackets. He also works for CELD (Central External Liaison Department), the intelligence service of the People's Republic of China, and possibly CCI (Central Control of Intelligence). Brokenclaw has managed to get his hands on a new technology that can detect submarine signatures which he plans to give to CELD. Additionally, Brokenclaw also plans to cause economic disaster by bringing about the collapse of the dollar. Ultimately Brokenclaw's plans are prevented by Bond.

He is tasked with following Bond and Chi-Chi to ensure their safety throughout their mission. After Bond and Chi-Chi disappear, Rushia searches California for them. After eventually picking up their signal he helps Bond escape a deathtrap in which Bond is thrown to Brokenclaw's wolves. He later teams up with Bond, off the record, to find Brokenclaw in Washington after Brokenclaw's hideout is raided.\nWanda Man Song Hing: A Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy, Wanda is undercover posing as Brokenclaw's lover.

The novel describes the origins and events of the Russian Revolution, interwoven with the experiences of Arthur Ransome, then a journalist in Russia. He becomes acquainted with the leading Bolsheviks and begins a romance with Trotsky's secretary Evgenia who will become his second wife. He also has close contact with people working for the British government and must decide where his loyalties lie.\nThe novel is in three parts. The first part, \"A Russian Fairy Tale\",  deliberately evokes the atmosphere of Arthur Ransome's Old Peter's Russian Tales. It is a fairy-tale account of the circumstances leading to the Russian Revolution, featuring the poor woodcutter, the orphaned children, the romantic but oblivious Royal family, the mad monk, the sleeping bear and the two conspirators in the wood.\nThe novel continues by presenting history from the perspective of an individual, an outsider. The English writer Arthur Ransome leaves his wife and daughter in London and travels to Russia to collect folktales. With the start of the First World War, he stays to observe events, becoming a correspondent for The Daily News.  In the second part of the novel, \"One Night in Moscow\", Ransome is haunted by the scenes he has witnessed. They appear as a scatter of flashbacks, reflecting the confusion in his mind. He has experienced the pull of Bolshevik idealism and has fallen in love with Trotsky's secretary, Evgenia. On the other hand he is appalled by the brutality of some revolutionaries and considers helping his friend Robert Lockhart of the British Embassy. He finally decides that he has no business interfering with the destiny of Russia, one way or the other, and leaves Moscow for Stockholm.\nThe final part, \"A Fairy Tale, Ending\", focuses on Ransome's private life, shifting into first person narration. Ransome's supposed Bolshevist sympathies bring him under suspicion when the Red Terror begins, but he redeems himself by helping to free Lockhart from the Kremlin. Ransome is happy with Evgenia in Stockholm and when she has to return to Russia, he chooses to go with her. To ease his return, he reconsiders the offer from the SIS and becomes agent S76. Lenin welcomes him back to Russia, dismissing Trotsky's fears that he might be a spy.\nOn what is intended to be a brief visit to England, he meets unexpected difficulties, being questioned by the authorities and losing his job with the Daily News. It is some months before he regains his journalist status, and meanwhile there is civil war in Russia. As the Tsarist White Army makes advances against the Bolshevik Red Army, he becomes worried for Evgenia's safety. He takes considerable risks to return to Russia and eventually succeeds in bringing her back west with him.\nThe novel closely follows the events of the Russian Revolution. The book incorporates a timeline, beginning with Bloody Sunday 1905 and ending in November 1919. It includes an account of Ransome's possible spying activities and reprints some Secret Service documents released by the National Archives in 2005. \nHistorical figures featured in the book include Rasputin, Vladimir Lenin, Lev Trotsky and the secret agents Robert Lockhart and Sidney Reilly. The writer Arthur Ransome and his future wife Evgenia Shelepina were also real people.\nBlood Red, Snow White was favourably reviewed by the major British newspapers  and was shortlisted for the 2007 Costa Children's Book Award.\nThe first edition hardback published in August 2007 by Orion Children's Books was printed throughout in dark red ink. A paperback edition was issued in May 2008. An audio CD was issued in March 2008 by Oakhill Publishing Limited.\n\"Children's Book Review: Blood Red Snow White by Marcus Sedgwick\".

Vagin's tightly composed gouaches show crowds, but the bustle doesn't come through. While his work is highly detailed (e.g., he finely delineates the lions' fur and manes, and shows the trim on an acrobat's costume), the scenes themselves look stiff and static.\"\nVagin, Vladimir Vasil\u02b9evich; Fletcher, Ralph J.

The Primrose Path is an 1995 novel by Carol Matas. According to the author, the book \"is about sexual abuse, but it's not graphic\". In addition to the text, Matas also supplies the reader with a six-page glossary detailing various terms related to the Jewish faith.\nThe Primrose Path was a finalist for the Manitoba Book of the Year in 1995, as well as being recognized as an Outstanding Book Of The Year by the Children\u2019s Book Centre in 1996. The novel was also a finalist for the Manitoba Young Readers Choice Award in 1997.\nIn 1995 Matas had been invited to speak at an interfaith luncheon at the Shaarey Zedek synagogue in Winnipeg where she and her family had attended for three generations; however the invitation was withdrawn several weeks before the scheduled presentation as the synagogue feared the possibility of libel because the fictional story had parallels with a recent charge against a Winnipeg rabbi. In response, Matas stated \"This is paranoia of the worst sort and censorship in the worst way. Libel chill isn't a strong enough term. Basically, they're censoring me and not the book. Somehow, I am no longer acceptable\". Denying all accounts that claimed her story held similarities with Bryks, saying that her book is \"a universal story which I based on research across North America. And in two other communities where I've spoken besides Winnipeg, people in the audience believe that the book is about a specific case in their community. It says to me that I'm doing my job as a writer because it is a universal story.\" Matas has not received any libel suits against the novel.\nhttp://carol.carolmatas.com/carol-matas-contemporary-fiction.htm Bibliography of Matas's novels at her website.\n\u201cBook\u2019s Theme Is Sexual Abuse: [FINAL Edition].\u201d The Gazette 21 Sept. 1995: F.10.

War of the Worlds: New Millennium  is a science fiction novel by Douglas Niles, released in 2005 by Tor Books.\nAfter the most recent unmanned mission to Mars inexplicably fails, interest in the Red Planet is still high. The whole world watches as a bright spot of light appears daily on the Martian surface. As they continue, theories abound about what is causing it. Telescopes pick up movement in space: something came from Mars and is headed towards Earth.\nAs explained in the Author's Note  of the novel, H. G. Wells wrote the original 1897 The War of the Worlds prior to any modern military conflict (such as World War I or World War II). This novel is the Martian invasion of Earth in 2005, in effect updating the Martians and the military\u2019s actual and doctrinal responses.\nAlex DeVane \u2013 Project manager for the Manned Mission to Mars program.\nMark DeVane \u2013 Father of Alex, former professor, and expert on Mars\nDuke Hayes \u2013 A-10 Warthog pilot\nNate Hayes \u2013 space shuttle pilot, brother to Duke Haye\nThis novel is an \"update\" to the H.G.

It was first printed in 1541, being the first non-religious book to be printed in Yiddish. For five centuries, it endured at least 40 editions. It is written in ottava rima and, according to Sol Liptzin, is \"generally regarded as the most outstanding poetic work in Old Yiddish\". [Liptzin, 1972, 5, 7]\nThe theme derives from the Anglo-Norman romance of Bevis of Hampton, by way of an Italian poem that had modified the name Bevis of Hampton to Buovo d'Antona and had, itself, been through at least thirty editions at the time of translation and adaptation into Yiddish. The central theme is the love of Bovo and Druziane. [Liptzin, 1972, 6], [Gottheil] The story \"had no basis in Jewish reality\", but compared to other chivalric romances it \"tone[s] down the Christian symbols of his original\" and \"substitute[s] Jewish customs, Jewish values and Jewish traits of character here and there...\" [Liptzin, 1972, 8]\nThe character was also popular in Russian folk culture as \"Prince Bova\".\nThe Bovo-Bukh later became known in the late 18th century as Bove-mayse \"Bove's tale\". This name was corrupted into bube mayse \"grandmother's tale\", meaning \"old wives' tale\".

Picaresque and episodic in nature, Denton's adventures include encounters with a tramp, a young man who attempts to con him out of money, various (sometimes none-too-hospitable) youth hostel proprietors and members of his own extended family, invariably on a quest for a bed for the night. Parts of the journey are lost to him, as he frankly remarks in the narrative: recounting his arrival at Castle Cary, Somerset (\"I think because I liked the name\") he states that \"I can remember nothing until I emerged at the market place at Dunster\" some 50 miles away. There is a similar gap between Salcombe, Devon and Taunton, although in this instance he recalls an episode walking part of the way \"with a boy from Bermondsey.\" Eventually running out of money, he gets some financial assistance from a youth hostel proprietor in Winchester to catch a train back to Henfield, where reminders of his unsatisfactory life there (in particular his indifferent aunt), prompt another odyssey, this time from Winchester to Canterbury.\nWelch did not return to the account, which he had entered in his journal for March of 1943. The narrative concludes as he is engaged in a watercolour painting of a view from Cocking churchyard.\nAs with much of Welch's unfinished writing, some of the material in this novel did have other incarnations: the incomplete short story \"Full Circle\" (which he wrote in 1942, before he started on this novel) is an expansion of the account of his first night away, when he slept rough in a barn in the company of the farmer's teenage son, although in that earlier tale it is more obviously fictionalised as a ghost story. Additionally, the second half of his completed and published short story \"The Barn\" (written around the same time as I Left My Grandfather's House) revisits the same theme, Denton becoming a nine-year-old and the teenager transformed into an older, but still youthful, tramp.\nI Left My Grandfather's House was first printed in 1958 by the Lion and Unicorn Press at the RCA (the Journals having been published in abridged form 1952 without this text). Long unavailable thereafter, it was re-published in 1984 by Allison & Busby. Further editions were issued by Exact Change in 1999 (along with In Youth is Pleasure), the Tartarus Press (as part of a two-volume Welch anthology) in 2005 and the Enitharmon Press in 2006. \nThe 1958 edition includes an introduction by Welch's art-school friend Helen Roeder. Several letters Welch wrote to Roeder appear as an appendix, although these concern his first novel, Maiden Voyage, rather than this work. These did not feature in any of the subsequent editions.\nThe first edition has two cover variants: An edition with black and white illustrations features a watercolour of a lane with trees and a cottage. (The cover of the 2006 reprint uses a similar theme but with a different illustration.) The cover of the colour edition is taken from a pen-and-ink drawing of c.1940 featuring a cow in the park of Oxon Hoath with the manor house in the background. This is in the Royal Academy Collection, having been bequeathed by Carel Weight in 1999.\nThis is not Welch's own title; the material was entered in the journal (and filling the remainder of the notebook in which it appears) under the heading \"Book I\". The title is taken from the first five words of the work's second sentence.

                "description": "A Glastonbury Romance was written by John Cowper Powys (18731963) in rural upstate New York and first published by Simon and Schuster in New York City  in March 1932. An English edition published by John Lane followed in 1933. It is the second of Powys's  Wessex novels, along with Wolf Solent (1929), Weymouth Sands (1934) and Maiden Castle (1936). Powys was an admirer of Thomas Hardy and these novels are set in Somerset and Dorset parts of Hardy's mythical Wessex. The action occurs over roughly a year, and the first two chapters of A Glastonbury Romance take place in Norfolk, where the late Canon William Crow's will is read, and the Crow family learn that his secretary-valet John Geard has inherited his wealth. ...",

In Powys's words this novel's \"heroine is the Grail\", and its central concern is with the various myths and legends along with history associated with Glastonbury.  It is also possible to see most of the main characters, John Geard, Sam Dekker, John Crow, and Owen Evans as undertaking a Grail quest. \nNot only is A Glastonbury Romance concerned with the legend that Joseph of Arimathea brought the Grail, a vessel containing the blood of Christ, to the town, but the further tradition that King Arthur was buried there. In addition one of the novel's main characters, the Welshman Owen Evans, introduces the idea that the Grail has a Welsh (Celtic), pagan pre-Christian origin. The main sources for Powys's ideas on mythology and the Grail legend are Sir John Rhys's Studies in the Arthurian Legend, R. S. Loomis's Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance, and the works of Jessie Weston, including From Ritual to Romance. T. S. Eliot's  The Waste Land is another probable influence. A central aspect of A Glastonbury Romance is the attempt by John Geard, ex-minister now the mayor of Glastonbury, to restore Glastonbury to its medieval glory as a place of religious pilgrimage. On the other hand, the Glastonbury industrialist Philip Crow, along with John and Mary Crow, and Tom Barter, who, like him, are from Norfolk, view the myths and legends of the town with contempt. Philip's vision is of  a future with more mines and more factories. John Crow, however, as he is penniless, takes on the task of organizing a pageant for Geard. At the same time an alliance of Anarchists, Marxists, and Jacobins try to turn Glastonbury into a commune.\nA Glastonbury Romance is also the first of several novels by Powys that reflect his growing interest in Welsh mythology, the others are Maiden Castle (1935), Morwyn (1937), Owen Glendower (1941), and Porius (1951). Like Powys, Owen Evans is a devoted student of Welsh mythology. He also resembles Powys in that he has strong urges toward violence and sadism, and is often tempted by sadistic pornography. But Evans is not the only character that resembles his creator, as both John Geard and John Crow reflect, in different ways, aspects of Powys's personality.\nA Glastonbury Romance has several climactic moments, before the major final one. Firstly there is Sam Dekker's decision, following his Grail vision, to give-up of his adulterous affair with Nell Zoyland, and to lead a monk-like existence. Then there's Evans' failed attempt to destroy his sadistic urge, by playing the part of Christ on the Cross at the Easter Pageant. Followed, however, by his wife Cordelia's ability to defeat his desire to witness a murder. The attempted murder of John Crow is equally climatic. But this involves Tom Barter's death, when he saves his friend John Crow, who is Mad Bet's intended victim. Finally the novel concludes with the a flooding of the low lying country surrounding Glastonbury, so that it becomes once again the legendary Isle of Avalon. This causes the death of Geard, and ends his ambitious plans for Glastonbury. However, the ending is ambiguous, rather than tragic, because just before he dies, Geard asks John Crow: \"do you suppose anyone's ever committed suicide out of an excess of life, simply to enjoy the last experience in full consciousness?\" (1955 edition, p.\u00a01041).\nJohn Geard, a mystic who influenced the late Canon Crow of Glastonbury and received the man's riches when he died.  Geard becomes mayor of the town during the course of the novel and becomes obsessed with the Grail Legend, commissioning new monuments for the town and promoting his own religious brand of Grail-worship.  He is married to Megan Geard - a marriage that is still physically passionate unlike that of Geard's rival, Philip Crow. Geard becomes fascinated with the youthful and delicate daughter of the Marquis of P., Rachel Zoyland. Megan Geard has Welsh ancestry, as her maiden name was Rhys.\nCordelia Geard, daughter of John and Megan Geard. Her name Cordelia may indicate a mythological identification with Creiddylad, daughter of Lludd in The Mabinogion. Her admirer, Owen Evans, identifies her with the Grail Messenger. Creiddylad is the name that Porius gives to the giantess in Powys's novel, Porius.\nJohn Crow, a young man from Norfolk who is coming to Glastonbury in the opening scene of the novel.  He eventually marries his cousin Mary Crow and works for John Geard.  A skeptic and cynic himself, he sees his work for Geard as a way of debasing and mocking the very"

How the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents  is a 1991 novel written by Dominican-American poet, novelist, and essayist Julia Alvarez. Told in reverse chronological order and narrated from shifting perspectives, the story spans more than thirty years in the lives of four sisters, beginning with their adult lives in the United States and ending with their childhood in the Dominican Republic, a country from which their family was forced to flee due to the father's opposition to Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo's dictatorship.\nThe novel's major themes include acculturation and coming of age.  It deals with the myriad hardships of immigration, painting a vivid picture of the struggle to assimilate, the sense of displacement, and the confusion of identity suffered by the Garc\u00eda family, as they are uprooted from familiarity and forced to begin a new life in New York City. The text consists of fifteen interconnected short stories, each of which focuses on one of the four daughters, and in a few instances, the Garc\u00eda family as a whole. Although it is told from alternating perspectives there is particular focus throughout the text on the character of Yolanda, who is said to be both the protagonist and the author's alter ego.\nThe years between 1956 and 1970 were a period of oppression and instability in the Dominican Republic as the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo came to an end with his assassination in 1961, only to be followed by military rule, revolution, intervention by the United States, and further dictatorship. Central control over the military, the economy, and the people meant that only a select few were allowed to leave the island. Critic William Luis describes the situation of immigrants from the Dominican Republic to the United States during the revolution: \"The displacement of Caribbean people from their islands to the United States, for political or economical reasons, has produced a tension between the culture of the country of origin and that of the adopted homeland, one representing the past and the other future of the immigrant\".\nThe Garc\u00eda family is an example of this phenomenon. In How the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents, Alvarez succeeds in altering the events of her own life to create fiction. The family is displaced to the United States after living an established, upper-class life in the Dominican Republic, and is forced to face the challenges which come along with being an immigrant family in a foreign land. Julia Alvarez herself was not born in the Dominican Republic, but in the United States. After her parents' failed attempt at a life in America, she returned to the Dominican Republic at the age of three months as her parents preferred the dictatorship of Trujillo to the US. Clearly in the novel, this is not the case, however throughout, the reader witnesses the Garcia family assimilate into American society. Although their Hispanic roots are reflected in their personalities, it is evident that the stories which focus on the four daughters depict many problems that normal North American girls do.\nEven though How the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents was written in the United States, there are significant historical ties between the novel and the author's country of origin. Alvarez wrote an essay entitled \"An American Childhood in the Dominican Republic\", in which she reveals some information about her own life. This is evidence that it may have served as the basis for the novel. For example, she mentions that it was Mr. Victor, of the US embassy and a member of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who persuaded Carlos Garc\u00eda to join the resistance against Trujillo, and later helped him in leaving the country, and obtaining a job with an international cardiovascular team. This is a parallel to the novel in which Carlos Garcia obtains work as a doctor in New York. Julia Alvarez emigrated to the United States at the age of 10 with her parents and three sisters as political refugees from the Dominican Republic. The novel is a variation of her real-life experiences, which have perhaps been slightly altered. The majority of her literature is constructed from multiple viewpoints and a strongly concealed political undercurrent is present in her literature. In this case, that undercurrent is her family fleeing the Trujillo revolution, something she did as a child. The novel encompasses the impact living under a regime can have on a family, and the way it shaped the four girls' upbringing. It is also an attempt to understand memory, the past, and a"

The Forests of Silence is a fantasy novel written by Australian author Emily Rodda, and is the first book in the eight-volume Deltora Quest series. It was first published in 2000 by Scholastic and was awarded the \"Notable Series in Children's Book of the Year Awards 2001: Younger Readers\". The novel follows a teenage boy named Lief as he and his companions search the deadly Forests of Silence for the magical Topaz gem, one of the seven missing gems from the belt of Deltora.\nLief: Lief is the main character of the series. Lief was born to parents Jarred and Anna of the Forge. As a child Lief roamed the streets of Del, sharpening his wits and gaining him the skills needed for his future quests. Though he did not know it, he was constantly protected by Barda and he prided himself on his many 'lucky' escapes. On his sixteenth birthday it is revealed to him that he must begin a dangerous quest to find the lost gems of the Belt of Deltora.\nBarda: Barda was enlisted as a friend by the king and queen of Deltora and was trusted to help him find the lost gems of Deltora sixteen years before the initial story took place. For the next sixteen years Barda disguised himself as a beggar so as to discover information vital to the quest. He also became the bodyguard of Jarred and Anna's child Lief, albeit without the semi-arrogant Lief's knowledge thereof. Upon Lief's sixteenth birthday Barda revealed himself to Lief and the quest for the gems of Deltora began. Though Barda was at first annoyed to travel encumbered by a child, he soon saw Lief as more of a help than a hindrance.\nJasmine: Jasmine is a wild girl, described as having wild black hair and emerald green eyes who has grown up in the Forests of Silence, where Lief and Barda meet her shortly after leaving Del. Her parents were captured by Grey Guards when she was seven years old, and so she has been raised by the forest. She can understand the language of the trees and of many animals, and has incredibly sharp senses, but has trouble understanding some social customs. Jasmine is usually seen with her raven, Kree, and a mouse-like creature she calls Filli. Jasmine is like Lief and occasionally has a quick temper. After helping Lief and Barda in the forest and with the help of the topaz, she is greeted by her mother's spirit from beyond the grave, who tells her to go with Lief and Barda in their quest. After this encounter, she joins Lief and Barda in the search for the great gems that will complete the Belt.\nDeltora series\nDeltora Quest (anime)\nLC Online Catalog - Item Information (Full Record).

The Book of Three (1964) is a high fantasy novel by American writer Lloyd Alexander, the first of five volumes in The Chronicles of Prydain. The series follows the adventures of Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper, a youth raised by Dallben the enchanter, as he nears manhood while helping to resist the forces of Arawn Death-Lord.\nThe book provided many elements of plot for the 1985 Disney animated feature The Black Cauldron.\nThe series was inspired by Welsh mythology and by the castles, scenery, and language of Wales, which the author experienced during World War II army combat intelligence training. The planned title of the first book was originally The Battle of the Trees.\nIn 2012 The Book of Three was ranked number 18 among all-time best children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. Ruth Hill Viguers of The Horn Book Magazine said the book would \"wear well, and that children will be eager for other stories in which Taran may yet learn the meaning of heroism. The Junior Bookshelf criticized the supporting characters, the contrived and excessive use of humor, and the heavy-use of lessons. Margery Fisher in Growing Point, criticized the novel for being too derivative of Tolkien, Garner, Masefield, and T.H. White  and that, \"perhaps with only one of these models or influences, it would be better\". The Times Literary Supplement called the novel \"a very fine fantasy-adventure\", admitting that the book does not compare to the works of Tolkien, but has \"quite a compelling magic of its own\". The School Library Journal called the novel, \"one of the most iconic and influential works of middle-grade fiction from the 20th century,\" which \"helped pave the way for countless fantasy adventures.\"\nThe Book of Three and its successor The Black Cauldron were loosely adapted by Walt Disney Productions and released in 1985 as Disney's 25th animated feature film, under the latter title. Gross receipts for The Black Cauldron did not match its production costs, commercially a great failure. Lloyd Alexander's reaction was twofold: \"First, I have to say, there is no resemblance between the movie and the book. Having said that, the movie in itself, purely as a movie, I found to be very enjoyable.\"\n\"The book of three\". LC Online Catalog. Library of Congress (lccn.loc.gov).

Spherical Harmonic is a science fiction novel from the Saga of the Skolian Empire  by Catherine Asaro. It tells the story of Dyhianna Selei (Dehya), the Ruby Pharaoh of the Skolian Imperialate, as she strives to reform her government and reunite her family in the aftermath of a devastating interstellar war.\nIn one sense, Spherical Harmonic is a space adventure about the recovery of a civilization from a war that had no winner.  On another level, it is about the emotional toll that war exacts on those who survive it, a theme Asaro often explores in the Saga of the Skolian Empire, as exemplified by the subplot in Spherical Harmonic involving the attempts of Selei and her husband to come to terms with his shattering experiences during the war. Both acclaimed and criticized for the complexity of her plotting, world building, and character development, Asaro focuses as much on the human condition as the adventure aspects of the story.\nAsaro is also known for the use of mathematics in her novels.  Spherical Harmonic involves an imagined universe based on the Hilbert space described by the angular wave functions that solve the Laplace Equation. The spherical harmonics are an orthonormal set of eigenfunctions used in many areas of math and  physics, including quantum mechanics and electromagnetics. A theoretical physicist by training, Asaro uses the concepts of the Hilbert space described by the harmonics to create the universe called Kyle space. By directly applying the rules that define Hilbert spaces, the author invents a universe where \"location\" is based on quantum wave functions rather than position and time, and where a psion's thoughts determined their location in Kyle space. As described in an essay at the end of the book, the properties of that universe and the abstract forms of human interaction there are fictional extrapolations of the mathematical theory.\nThe novel Spherical Harmonic overlaps with Ascendant Sun which tells the events after the Radiance War from the point of view of new Skolian Imperator Kelric.  It also overlaps with the book The Moon's Shadow which centers on Eubian Emperor Jaibriol III and his efforts to initiate peace talks with Skolians after the war.\n\"Spherical Harmonic\".

General Winston's Daughter is a fantasy novel by American writer Sharon Shinn, published in 2007.\nLady Averie Agatha Winston, known as Averie, is thrilled to finally leave Aebria, where she grew up, and visit Chiarrin, a colony of Aebria, where her father and her fiance work. Her father, the general who oversees the colony, and her fiance, a captain in the military, are much less thrilled and very protective. They warns her of the dangers of Chiarrin, and also tell her that the people here are not happy with Aebrian occupation. But Averie can see nothing but beauty in this new land she gets to explore.\nShe befriends a Chiarrin local named Jalessa when she buys traditional Chiarrizi dress, headscarf, and sandals, who teaches her the meaning of the colors of Chiarrin headscarves. However, Jalessa is injured by a bombing on the market, carried out by rebels who refuse to submit to Aebrian rule. Averie brings Jalessa back to her house and offers her a job as her maid. Jalessa accepts, and the two become good friends. Averie pushes the boundaries of the strict older Aebrians who are also in residence, but her peers are infatuated by her unwillingness to follow the rules if she doesn't think they are good rules. Averie also begins to fall in love with another soldier and realizes that she may not be in love with her betrothed anymore.\nAverie learns that Jalessa doesn't speak Aebrian and offers to teach her, expressing regret that her new friend has been unable to understand their conversations. Averie's uptight governess Lady Selkie helps Jalessa learn Aebrian. The boldness of the rebels increases and Averie starts to see a darker side to the Chiarrizi culture. Jalessa teaches her about their gods, all of whom have been crippled in one way or another, yet still stand tall. Their gods, Jalessa says, cannot be held captive.\nAverie wakes up to smoke one morning. The entire city is burning. Chiarrin has sacrificed itself to drive out the Aebrian military. Jalessa reveals that she is a member of the rebels, and was the one who signaled the bombers when she was injured. The plan was to kill the Aebrian women until the men left. Because Averie taught her to speak Aebrian, she was able to spy on General Winston's plans. Averie realizes she knows nothing about Jalessa's family or anything important to her. She asks Jalessa if she will just let her die, and Jalessa tells her to get out of the city.\nAverie returns home. Most of the officers she had befriended are dead, and she broke up with her fiance. Her father was killed getting men out of Chiarrin. She claims her fortune, and tells the man she's fallen in love with, Lieutenant Ket Du'Kai, that she's going to follow him until he marries her. He agrees to let her come with him as he goes back home to Xan'tai, another Aebrian colony.\n\nThe protagonist of the series, Lady Averie Agatha Winston is the only child of General Winston.

Typhoon is a short novel  by Joseph Conrad, begun in 1899 and serialized in Pall Mall Magazine in January\u2013March 1902. Its first book publication was in New York by Putnam in 1902; it was also published in Britain in Typhoon and Other Stories by Heinemann in 1903.\nConrad \"broke new ground\" by showing the ways a steam ship differs from a sailing vessel, an historic shift occurring at the time. For example how the crew were broken into \"sailors and firemen\" [engineers]; the unromantic labors of Hackett and Beal; the captain as a mirror of his ship, isolated from nature and lacking the power of imagination.\nStylistically, Conrad made \"perhaps the most celebrated ellipsis in modern short fiction\". At the end of chapter V the story reaches a climactic point, the ship barely makes it into the eye of the typhoon and faces a final challenge to exit the storm through the eye wall. \nThe hurricane, with its power to madden the seas, to sink ships, to uproot trees, to overturn strong walls and dash the very birds of the air to the ground, had found this taciturn man in its path, and, doing its utmost, had managed to wring out a few words. Before the renewed wrath of winds swooped on his ship, Captain MacWhirr was moved to declare, in a tone of vexation, as it were: \u201cI wouldn't like to lose her.\u201d\nThis is followed by a single sentence:\nHe was spared that annoyance.\nThe story then leaps forward in time with the ship back in port, the events of what happened unstated. This was an innovative technique with hints of post-modernism. He challenges the reader to fill in the events of the story themselves. The break in the chronology is particularly effective, and jarring, as the preceding passages had been so detailed that the time it took to read the novel and the real time of the story were not so far apart.\nIn 1887, Conrad worked as chief mate on the Highland Forest under Captain John McWhir, whom he portrays in the novel as \"McWhirr\". He drew upon this 6 months voyage for the novel. \nConrad once dictated to biographer and friend Richard Curle a list of ships he served on, and the stories they were connected to - the connections might have been minor (a single character or incident) or major (a complete voyage), Conrad did not indicate. For Typhoon he said it \"suggested\" the steamer John P. Best which he served on.\nJoseph Conrad dedicated the book to Cunninghame Graham, a fellow writer and Scots radical who was an enthusiastic supporter of Conrad since his earliest publications.\nCaptain Thomas MacWhirr, an empirical man without imagination.\nCaptain Wilson from \"Melita\", the \"storm-strategist\".\nJukes, the first mate (with no first name).\nJukes' absent friends - second mate Jack Allen and another mate from trans-Atlantic liner (addressee of Jukes' letter).\nSolomon Rout, the chief engineer, an experienced seaman.\nSecond engineer Harry and third engineer Beale.\nThe boatswain.\nThe second mate.\nSailors, steward and cook of the \"Nan-Shan\".\nThe coolies, hired workers from India and China.\nThe clerk for Messrs.

As the foreign rhythms of her new life sweep her along, the general's daughter begins to question the ethics and wisdom of colonial governance, depicted as a rough parallel to British rule during empire days. She delves into the culture, strains against the fussy restraints of her era and social class, and finds herself drawn to an officer of non-Aerbrian descent. But it is an interesting young woman from the marketplace, Jalessa, who truly opens a window into Chiarrizi culture.

General Winston's Daughter is a fantasy novel by American writer Sharon Shinn, published in 2007.\nLady Averie Agatha Winston, known as Averie, is thrilled to finally leave Aebria, where she grew up, and visit Chiarrin, a colony of Aebria, where her father and her fiance work. Her father, the general who oversees the colony, and her fiance, a captain in the military, are much less thrilled and very protective. They warns her of the dangers of Chiarrin, and also tell her that the people here are not happy with Aebrian occupation. But Averie can see nothing but beauty in this new land she gets to explore.\nShe befriends a Chiarrin local named Jalessa when she buys traditional Chiarrizi dress, headscarf, and sandals, who teaches her the meaning of the colors of Chiarrin headscarves. However, Jalessa is injured by a bombing on the market, carried out by rebels who refuse to submit to Aebrian rule. Averie brings Jalessa back to her house and offers her a job as her maid. Jalessa accepts, and the two become good friends. Averie pushes the boundaries of the strict older Aebrians who are also in residence, but her peers are infatuated by her unwillingness to follow the rules if she doesn't think they are good rules. Averie also begins to fall in love with another soldier and realizes that she may not be in love with her betrothed anymore.\nAverie learns that Jalessa doesn't speak Aebrian and offers to teach her, expressing regret that her new friend has been unable to understand their conversations. Averie's uptight governess Lady Selkie helps Jalessa learn Aebrian. The boldness of the rebels increases and Averie starts to see a darker side to the Chiarrizi culture. Jalessa teaches her about their gods, all of whom have been crippled in one way or another, yet still stand tall. Their gods, Jalessa says, cannot be held captive.\nAverie wakes up to smoke one morning. The entire city is burning. Chiarrin has sacrificed itself to drive out the Aebrian military. Jalessa reveals that she is a member of the rebels, and was the one who signaled the bombers when she was injured. The plan was to kill the Aebrian women until the men left. Because Averie taught her to speak Aebrian, she was able to spy on General Winston's plans. Averie realizes she knows nothing about Jalessa's family or anything important to her. She asks Jalessa if she will just let her die, and Jalessa tells her to get out of the city.\nAverie returns home. Most of the officers she had befriended are dead, and she broke up with her fiance. Her father was killed getting men out of Chiarrin. She claims her fortune, and tells the man she's fallen in love with, Lieutenant Ket Du'Kai, that she's going to follow him until he marries her. He agrees to let her come with him as he goes back home to Xan'tai, another Aebrian colony.\n\nThe protagonist of the series, Lady Averie Agatha Winston is the only child of General Winston.

Lauren Beukes dives into the lives of four main characters to exemplify the wide spectrum of social hierarchies that reside in Moxyland. Through these four characters, Beukes illustrates a society where technology rules with an iron fist and in doing so shows the limitations of freedom. Beukes uses first person to highlight central themes throughout the novel.\nKendra\nKendra, an art school dropout reinvented as shiny brand ambassador, known as a sponsor baby. Ghost girl (7)\u201d is an artistic photographer with hopes of exposing her work. Kendra voluntarily becomes sponsored by a corporation. She is injected with experimental nanobots that enhance her physical and mental abilities. They are even supposed to stop any illnesses so that she will never be sick again. A side effect of the nanotechnology is that it makes Kendra addicted to a high-tech soft drink called Ghost. A glowing green tattoo in the shape of the corporation's logo appeared after injection that showed she was branded. Beukes uses Kendra's story to reveal the overwhelming power that technology has over Moxyland inhabitants because essentially Kendra becomes a walking advertisement.\nLerato\nLerato is a young female corporation worker who seems to have figured out the way in Moxyland. Lerato, unlike the rest of the main characters, lives comfortably in the cushions of corporate Moxyland. Lerato's autonomic success in Moxyland can be described as a rags-to-riches story. She became an orphan after her parents died of AIDs. She attended a corporation school for AIDs orphans and then was hired to work at a corporation. Her skills allow her to climb the professional ladder, and she uses her computer skills and inside job to aid Tendeka's cause.\nTendeka\nTendeka is a passionate, idealistic revolutionary figure in Moxyland.  He is against corporations and corruption. He and Ash, his lover, create and conduct projects to help provide food and shelter to street children in Cape Town. Tendeka even goes as far as pretending to be married to a young pregnant girl in order to make a statement. His drive to promote change shows that not all people (mostly outsiders) are happy with the system. Tendeka refuses to accept the superior power of technology in this society. However, he sometimes contradicts himself because he fears being disconnected from society, even though he believes the way society is structured is unjust. Tendeka, along with the help of skyward*, participates in underground revolutionary events attempting to end technological totalitarianism in Moxyland.\nToby\nToby plays a role in all the other characters\u2019 lives, whether positively or negatively, due to his narcissistic tendencies. This makes him a vital part to the progression of the novel. He runs a 24-hour vlog stream called \u201cDiary of Cunt\u201d which streams what he is going through. At times, he creates or looks for chaos so that his life can appear interesting, and so that he can be recognized by the media. This is difficult to do in Moxyland because citizens are constantly being bombarded with advertisements, therefore it is difficult to stand out. Toby uses his BabyStrange media coat, which records anything that crosses his path, to get film for his vlog. Toby is self-centered and his course of actions only emphasizes his concern for own personal gain. He eventually becomes involved in \u201creal-life\u201d gaming.\nSkyward*\nSkyward* is an anonymous omnipotent power in Moxyland, an online game. Skyward* aids Tendeka by supplying technology and inside information. Skyward* is a close ally to Tendenka and a strong supporter of Tendeka's cause.\nMoxyland is set in a futuristic Cape Town, South Africa. The city is plagued by various economic, ecological, medical, racial, and socio-economic issues, and the populace is divided into tiers based on one's class, health, race, and ownership of a cellphone and a SIM card. A SIM card in a cellphone is a device, which contains one's bank account, personal information, and records. Without either a cellphone or a SIM card, one is cut off or \u201cdisconnected\u201d from food, water, shelter, or any form of communication and transportation. Using a combination of this kind of technology and the media, the government maintains control over the metropolis and people.\nThe advancement of technology in Moxyland focuses mainly on digital technology and biotechnology. As aforementioned, one's identity is contained in a SIM card, as well as an avatar. Online and virtual gaming are one of the hedonistic trends promoted by the media and used to distract the affluent and privileged upper class from the reality of AIDS, apartheid, and the social"

Leonard traces the history of Koch Industries from a regional pipeline company to a sprawling corporate entity with \"a political-influence machine of rare scope\". The first part of is devoted to the history of Koch Industries, beginning with Charles Koch\u2019s assumption of leadership after the death of his father Fred in 1967. It traces the corporate history through the 70s and 80s as Koch  grows the company and structures it in such a way that its profits rely mostly on volatility within the petroleum industry (meaning Koch makes money when oil prices go down as well as up).  Also detailed are Koch\u2019s extensive union-busting activities, a battle for control of the company between Charles Koch and his brothers,  and the story of Koch\u2019s first major setback with the disastrous 1996  purchase of Purina Mills (which Koch sold after 5 turbulent years)\nThe second part focuses on Koch\u2019s diversification into the financial sector, as the company begins leveraging its extensive infrastructure and commodity holdings to take advantage of booming financial markets in the 1990s and 2000s. This section includes the first real comprehensive look at the astronomical profits Koch generated in the commodities markets,  its purchase of Georgia-Pacific, and its participation in the events that created the 2000 California electricity crisis.\nThe final part of the book examines how Koch Industries many legal entanglements with government regulators and Charles Koch\u2019s own libertarian philosophies fueled the Koch\u2019s decades-long efforts to discredit climate change by creating one of the largest influence operation in existence.\nKochland was widely praised upon its release. In The New Yorker, Jane Mayer described the book as a \u201cdeeply and authoritatively reported\" work that \"marshals a huge amount of information and uses it to help solve two enduring mysteries: how the Kochs got so rich, and how they used that fortune to buy off American action on climate change\u201d. Bryan Burrough noted that \"what\u2019s most impressive is its refreshing balance and evenhandedness. Leonard does not judge the Kochs; he explains them \u2014 their operations and acquisitions, successes and failures, trading strategies, business philosophies and family feuds'. Kochland was awarded the J.

The Dharma Bums is a 1958 novel by Beat Generation author Jack Kerouac. The basis for the novel's semi-fictional accounts are events occurring years after the events of On the Road. The main characters are the narrator Ray Smith, based on Kerouac, and Japhy Ryder, based on the poet and essayist Gary Snyder, who was instrumental in Kerouac's introduction to Buddhism in the mid-1950s. \nThe book concerns duality in Kerouac's life and ideals, examining the relationship of the outdoors, mountaineering, hiking, and hitchhiking through the west US with his \"city life\" of jazz clubs, poetry readings, and drunken parties. The protagonist's search for a \"Buddhist\" context to his experiences (and those of others he encounters) recurs throughout the story. The book had a significant influence on the Hippie counterculture of the 1960s.\nKerouac often based his fictional characters on friends and family.\n\"Because of the objections of my early publishers I was not allowed to use the same personae names in each work.\"\n\u2014\u2009Jack Kerouac\nGary Snyder wrote Kerouac saying \"Dharma Bums is a beautiful book, & I am amazed & touched that you should say so many nice things about me because that period was for me really a great process of learning from you...\" but confided to Philip Whalen, \"I do wish Jack had taken more trouble to smooth out dialogues, etc. Transitions are rather abrupt sometimes.\" Later, Snyder chided Kerouac for the book's misogynistic interpretation of Buddhism.\nDharma\n\"Books Today\".

The basis for the novel's semi-fictional accounts are events occurring years after the events of On the Road. The main characters are the narrator Ray Smith, based on Kerouac, and Japhy Ryder, based on the poet and essayist Gary Snyder, who was instrumental in Kerouac's introduction to Buddhism in the mid-1950s. The book concerns duality in Kerouac's life and ideals, examining the relationship of the outdoors, mountaineering, hiking, and hitchhiking through the west US with his \"city life\" of jazz clubs, poetry readings, and drunken parties. ...",

The character Japhy drives Ray Smith's story, whose penchant for simplicity and Zen Buddhism influenced Kerouac on the eve of the sudden and unpredicted success of On the Road. The action shifts between the events of Smith and Ryder's \"city life,\" such as three-day parties and enactments of the Buddhist \"Yab-Yum\" rituals, to the sublime and peaceful imagery where Kerouac seeks a type of transcendence. The novel concludes with a change in narrative style, with Kerouac working alone as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak (adjacent to Hozomeen Mountain), in what would soon be declared North Cascades National Park (see also Kerouac's novel Desolation Angels). His summer on Desolation Peak was desperately lonely. \u201cMany's the time I thought I'd die of boredom or jump off the mountain,\u201d he wrote in Desolation Angels. Yet in The Dharma Bums, Kerouac described the experience in elegiac prose.\nOne episode in the book features Smith, Ryder, and Henry Morley (based on real-life friend John Montgomery) climbing Matterhorn Peak in California. It relates Kerouac's introduction to this type of mountaineering and inspired him to spend the following summer as a fire lookout for the United States Forest Service on Desolation Peak in Washington.\n\nChapter 2 of the novel gives an account of the legendary 1955 Six Gallery reading, where Allen Ginsberg ('Alvah Goldbrook' in the book) gave a debut presentation of his poem \"Howl\" (changed to \"Wail\" in the book). At the event, other authors including Snyder, Kenneth Rexroth, Michael McClure, and Philip Whalen also performed.\nAnyway I followed the whole gang of howling poets to the reading at Gallery Six that night, which was, among other important things, the night of the birth of the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance. Everyone was there. It was a mad night. And I was the one who got things jumping by going around collecting dimes and quarters from the rather stiff audience standing around in the gallery and coming back with three huge gallon jugs of California Burgundy and getting them all piffed so that by eleven o'clock when Alvah Goldbrook was reading his poem 'Wail' drunk with arms outspread everybody was yelling 'Go! Go! Go!' (like a jam session) and old Rheinhold Cacoethes the father of the Frisco poetry scene was wiping his tears in gladness.\nKerouac often based his fictional characters on friends and family.\n\"Because of the objections of my early publishers I was not allowed to use the same personae names in each work.\"\n\u2014\u2009Jack Kerouac\nGary Snyder wrote Kerouac saying \"Dharma Bums is a beautiful book, & I am amazed & touched that you should say so many nice things about me because that period was for me really a great process of learning from you...\" but confided to Philip Whalen, \"I do wish Jack had taken more trouble to smooth out dialogues, etc. Transitions are rather abrupt sometimes.\" Later, Snyder chided Kerouac for the book's misogynistic interpretation of Buddhism.\nDharma\n\"Books Today\".

The book begins with a brief introduction to the main character, Leo, at an early age, which is followed by his move from his home state of Pennsylvania to Arizona when he is 12. Before the move, his Uncle Pete gives Leo a porcupine necktie as a farewell present, inspiring him to collect more like it. After his birthday and collection of porcupine neckties are mentioned in a local newspaper when he's 14, Leo receives a second porcupine necktie, left anonymously.\nThe story picks up two years later with the arrival of Stargirl Caraway at Leo's school, Mica High. Leo learns that up until this point, she has been homeschooled, but even that doesn't seem to excuse her strange behavior; for example, she comes to school in strange outfits\u2014kimonos, buckskin, 1920s flapper clothes, and pioneer clothes. She also brings a ukulele to school every day, as well as her pet rat, Cinnamon. She is so different that at first, the student body does not know what to make of her. Hillari Kimble, a well known and somewhat popular girl at Leo's school, declares that Stargirl is a fake, and speculation and rumors abound.\nOne of Stargirl's quirks is singing happy birthday to students when it is their birthday, bringing her ukulele to school to do so. When Hillari orders Stargirl not to sing to her on her birthday, Stargirl sings Hillari's name but directs the song to Leo and mentions in front of everyone that she thinks he is cute. Though at first rejected by most of the students, Stargirl gains a measure of popularity and is asked to join the cheerleading squad after she succeeds in getting the crowd excited about the school's losing football team while cheering for them at a game. Students mimic her behavior, and at lunch, she no longer sits alone. Her antics on the squad spark a boom in audience attendance at sporting events.\nHowever, Stargirl's popularity is short-lived. Thanks in part to her efforts, the football and cheer season is the best in the school's history, and school spirit flourishes; however, students begin to resent Stargirl's habit of cheering for both teams, which before had added to her popularity. Their anger comes to a head during the filming of the student-run television show, Hot Seat, which is run by Leo and his best friend Kevin. During the show, a \"jury\" of students is invited to ask questions of the guest star. This show's guest is Stargirl, and the session turns into an embarrassing attack on Stargirl's personality and actions. An advising teacher cuts the show short, and it is never aired, but the damage is done. Shortly thereafter, Stargirl stops cheering for both teams at games, but cannot stop herself from comforting a hurt player from the opposing team during a playoff basketball game and is blamed for Mica High's loss in the following game. She is shunned by the entire student body, except for her friend Dori Dilson, Leo, and, to some extent, Kevin.\nLeo praises Stargirl for her kindness, bravery, and nonconformity, and the two begin a tentative romance. They spend more and more time together, and Leo experiences her unusual lifestyle and starts helping her with various projects, such as leaving cards for people they don't know and dropping change on the sidewalk for others to find. For a while, he is deliriously happy with their relationship, but as reality sets in, he realizes that the entire school is shunning both of them. In response, Leo convinces Stargirl to act more \"normal.\" She starts going by her real name (Susan), wears typical teen clothing, and becomes obsessed with being accepted and popular. These actions fail to produce results.\nStargirl decides that the best way to become popular is to win the state's public speaking competition, which she does. But when she returns to the school expecting a hero's welcome, only three people show up. Realizing that she has achieved nothing by trying to fit in and has betrayed her true self, Stargirl reverts to her former personality. Seeing that dating Stargirl is getting him shunned by his peer group,  Leo parts ways with her so he can be accepted in social company, choosing his peer group as a group over his sweetheart.\nDespite the parting, Stargirl attends the school's spring dance\u2014the Ocotillo ball\u2014with Dori. Leo watches as Stargirl arrives at the dance on a bike covered in sunflowers. Though initially ignored by the other attendees, something about Stargirl attracts attention and temporary acceptance. She convinces the bandleader to play the \"Bunny Hop,\" and the other students come to join her in the dance until the only people not in line are"

Mixing fact and fiction, the Duc de Saint-Simon recounts three episodes in which he and his wife involve themselves in the notorious schemings of King Louis XIV's Versailles. Throughout, the famous courtier's attitudes toward the King and court shift. In the first story, the young Duc, appalled at the King's calculating matches of his illegitimate offspring with prominent aristocrats, works to subvert the wedding of one of Louis' nephews, but is thwarted when his adversaries threaten to expose the homosexuality of both the King's brother and the narrator's patron, the Prince de Conti. In the second, Saint-Simon is maneuvered into acting as messenger between Conti (who is briefly King of Poland in 1697) and Conti's mistress, Madame la Duchesse. In this the Duc is subverted by his own wife's schemings. Finally, in later years, rumors of incest are deployed by both sides in a struggle to determine which of two ill-pedigreed \"princesses\" will be matched with one of the King's legitimate grandsons. The high-minded Saint-Simon emerges from these intrigues disillusioned (\"We had all...been made part of the Versailles system\"), but resolves (after the King's death) to record the monarch's \"great style\" and quest for glory.\n\"Perspective View from the Chateau of Versailles of the Place d'Armes and the Stables\". www.scholarsresource.com.

At the start of Cibola Burn the United Nations, Martian and Outer Planets Alliance governments have thus far restricted exploration and colonization efforts to one corporate scientific survey mission to one of these planets. Complicating matters is the existence of a colonial settlement already on the planet from before the military blockade of the rings came into effect. Both sides claim ownership in a confrontation reflecting many colonial interactions throughout history. ...",

Cibola Burn is a 2014 science fiction novel by James S. A. Corey (pen name of Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck) and the fourth book in The Expanse series. It follows the crew of the Rocinante as they join the flood of humanity out into the galaxy, using the gates built by the ancient civilization that also produced the protomolecule.\nAt the release of Cibola Burn, Orbit Books announced that James S. A. Corey would write three additional books in the series (adding to two that were already planned) to bring the series to nine novels and various short stories. Cibola Burn serves as the basis for the fourth season of the television series The Expanse, which was released by Amazon Video December 13, 2019.\nBasia Merton is one of the refugees from Ganymede refused safe harbor in the Solar System. His ship pushed through the gate to be the first to settle a new planet. Called Ilus by the inhabitants, they found a rich vein of lithium that could provide a valuable trading commodity with other systems. The United Nations sends a scientific party to the planet with a legal charter to the land. This drives Basia to actions he never thought he would do, and it seems like he has a never-ending set of decisions between bad choices, while he's only trying to do what he thinks is best for his family.\nElvi Okoye is a scientist on the team sent by the United Nations. Her original task was to try to survey the planet in a pristine state but events make that impossible. Later, she tries to gain insight into the incredible things happening on the planet that make it seem like the most hospitable biosphere found away from Earth may kill them all.\nDmitri Havelock was Miller's partner on Ceres and is now deputy security chief for the UN mission to New Terra. Remaining aboard the ship that brought him while the security chief relocates to the surface, he becomes increasingly concerned about the actions of his supervisor. Later, the fortunate capture of a prisoner from the Rocinante sets a chain of events into motion with long-term repercussions for humanity.\nJames Holden Sensing trouble brewing on Ilus/New Terra, Chrisjen Avasarala sees the need for someone perceived as unbiased to negotiate and report on events there and chooses Jim Holden. After making the journey, the crew tries their best to balance colonial claims, government priority and the awakening creatures on the planet within a crisis greater than all their earlier concerns.\nJoe Miller is still trying to figure out his role within the alien construct, while maintaining his connection with Holden. Eventual clues come together allowing him to shut down the alien machinery and potentially save everyone. However, both the remnants of Miller and The Investigator are killed in the process.\nPublishers Weekly gave Cibola Burn a starred review and called it \"splendid\".\n\"Cover Reveals!

It is Robinson's second novel, following Housekeeping (1980). Gilead is an epistolary novel, as the entire narrative is a single, continuing, albeit episodic, document, written on several occasions in a form combining a journal and a memoir. It comprises the fictional autobiography of the Reverend John Ames, an elderly, white Congregationalist pastor in the small, secluded town of Gilead, Iowa (also fictional), who knows that he is dying of a heart condition. ...",

The book is an account of the memories and legacy of John Ames as he remembers his experiences of his father and grandfather to share with his son. All three men share a vocational lifestyle and profession as Congregationalist ministers in Gilead, Iowa. John Ames describes his vocation as \"giving you a good basic sense of what is being asked of you and also what you might as well ignore\", explaining that your vocation is something both hard to fulfill and hard to obtain. He writes that this is one of the most important pieces of wisdom he can bestow upon his son. Ames's father was a Christian pacifist, but his grandfather was a radical abolitionist who carried out guerrilla actions with John Brown before the American Civil War, served as a chaplain with the Union forces in that war, and incited his congregation to join up and serve in it; as Ames remarks, his grandfather \"preached his people into the war.\" The grandfather returned from the war maimed with the loss of his right eye. Thereafter he was given the distinction that his right side was holy or sacred in some way, that it was his link to commune with God, and he was notorious for a piercing stare with the one eye he had left.\nThe grandfather's other eccentricities are recalled in his youth: the practice of giving all and any of the family's possessions to others and preaching with a gun in a bloodied shirt. The true character and intimate details of the father are revealed in context with anecdotes regarding the grandfather, and mainly in the search for the grave of the grandfather. One event that is prevalent in the narrator's orations is the memory of receiving 'communion' from his father at the remains of a Baptist church, burned by lightning (Ames recalls this as an invented memory adapted from his father breaking and sharing an ashy biscuit for lunch). In the course of the novel, it quickly emerges that Ames's first wife, Louisa, died while giving birth to their daughter, Rebecca (a.k.a. Angeline) who also died soon after. Ames reflects on the death of his family as the source of great sorrow for many years, in contrast and with special reference to the growing family of the Rev. Boughton, local Presbyterian minister and Ames's dear and lifelong friend.\nMany years later Ames meets his second wife, Lila, a less-educated woman who appears in church one Pentecost Sunday. Eventually Ames baptizes Lila and their relationship develops, culminating in her proposal to him. As Ames writes his memoirs, Boughton's son, John Ames Boughton (Jack), reappears in the town after leaving it in disgrace twenty years earlier, following his seduction and abandonment of a girl from a poverty-stricken family near his university. The daughter of this relationship died poor and uncared-for at the age of three, despite the Boughton family's well-intended but unwelcome efforts to look after the child. Young Boughton, the apple of his parents' eye but deeply disliked by Ames, seeks Ames out; much of the tension in the novel results from Ames's mistrust of Jack Boughton and particularly of his relationship with Lila and their son. In the d\u00e9nouement, however, it turns out that Jack Boughton is himself suffering from his forced separation from his own common-law wife, an African American from Tennessee, and their son; the family are not allowed to live together because of segregationist laws, and her family utterly rejects Jack Boughton. It is implied that Jack's understanding with Lila lies in their common sense of tragedy as she prepares for the death of Ames, who has given her a security and stability she has never known before.\nAlthough there is action in the story, its mainspring lies in Ames's theological struggles on a whole series of fronts: with his grandfather's engagement in the Civil War, with his own loneliness through much of his life, with his brother's clear and his father's apparent loss of belief, with his father's desertion of the town, with the hardships of people's lives, and above all with his feelings of hostility and jealousy towards young Boughton, whom he knows at some level he has to forgive. Ames's struggles are illustrated by numerous quotations from the Bible, from theologians (especially Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion), and from philosophers, especially the atheist Feuerbach, whom Ames greatly respects.\nThe abstract and theological content of the book is seen through the eyes of Ames, who is presented in a deeply sympathetic manner and who writes his memoir from a position of serenity, despite his"

Emerson \"Em\" Watts accompanies her sister, Frida, and her best friend, Christopher, to a Stark Megastore opening in SoHo, which is attended by teen supermodel Nikki Howard and British musician Gabriel Luna, who Frida hopes to meet. Protesters attend the event because the Stark Megastore has replaced a locally owned grocery store, and one of the protesters shoots a plasma screen with a paintball gun, snapping the wires. Em saves her sister from being hit by the falling plasma screen but takes the hit herself.

In an effort to save Em, her parents agreed to a controversial brain transplant offered by Stark Industries, transplanting her brain into Nikki's body, on the condition that Em continues Nikki's career as the face of Stark Industries; the penalty for breaching this contract would be two million dollars.\nEm is forced to take on the role of Nikki Howard, all the while struggling with the fact that she does not have control over her life. She tries to let go of her tomboyish ways to take over Nikki's glamorous lifestyle. Although she is now dealing with Nikki's job, friends, and various boyfriends, she fights to keep some of her old life by going back to school and facing Christopher, whom she has a secret crush on. As Em follows through with Nikki's commitments, she realizes that the supermodel lifestyle is a lot harder than she perceived it to be. When Em notices that Christopher is now a mess because of her supposed death, she goes out of her way to talk to him, and try to make him realize that she is still alive in someone else's body.\nThe novel ends with Em bringing Lulu to her family's house for dinner, Em learns that Lulu doesn't have a family and spends most of her time drinking and partying.

Architect Guy Haines wants to divorce his unfaithful wife, Miriam, in order to marry the woman he loves, Anne Faulkner. While on a train to see his wife, he meets Charles Anthony Bruno, a psychopathic playboy who proposes an idea to \"exchange murders\": Bruno will kill Miriam if Guy kills Bruno's father; neither of them will have a motive, and the police will have no reason to suspect either of them. Guy does not take Bruno seriously, but Bruno kills Guy's wife while Guy is away in Mexico.\nBruno informs Guy of his crime, but Guy hesitates to turn him in to the police. He realizes that Bruno could claim Guy's complicity in the planned exchange murders; however, the longer he remains silent, the more he implicates himself. This implicit guilt becomes stronger as in the coming months Bruno makes appearances demanding that Guy honor his part of the bargain. After Bruno starts writing anonymous letters to Guy's friends and colleagues, the pressure becomes too great, and Guy murders Bruno's father.\nSubsequently, Guy is consumed by guilt, whereas Bruno seeks Guy's company as if nothing had happened. He makes an uninvited appearance at Guy's wedding, causing a scene. At the same time, a private detective, who suspects Bruno of having arranged the murder of his father, establishes the connection between Bruno and Guy that began with the train ride, and suspects Bruno of Miriam's murder. Guy also becomes implicated due to his contradictions about the acquaintance with Bruno.\nWhen Bruno falls overboard during a sailing cruise, Guy identifies so strongly with Bruno that he tries to rescue him under threat to his own life. Nevertheless, Bruno drowns, and the murder investigation is closed. Guy, however, is plagued by guilt, and confesses the double murder to Miriam's former lover. This man, however, does not condemn Guy, and instead dismisses Miriam, as well as women in general, while enjoying Guy's liquor. The detective who had been investigating the murders overhears Guy's confession, however, and confronts him. Guy turns himself over to the detective immediately.\nPlaywright Craig Warner acquired the stage rights to Strangers on a Train in 1995, and wrote both theatrical and radio adaptations of the story. The radio version was recorded and broadcast by the BBC, and released on CD in May 2004. The West End production of the play ran from November 2, 2013, to February 22, 2014, at the Gielgud Theatre and starred Jack Huston, Laurence Fox, Miranda Raison, Imogen Stubbs, Christian McKay, and MyAnna Buring. It was directed by Robert Allan Ackerman and its seven credited producers include Barbara Broccoli. A United Kingdom touring schedule was announced from January to March 2018.\nLike the Hitchcock film, the Warner versions respect Highsmith's homosexual subtext. The radio version more closely follows the plot of the novel, although there are several differences in the denouement. Guy's eventual confession is to Anne, not to Miriam's lover. The detective succeeds in solving the original murder plot and confronts Bruno with the details, but declines to take further action because he believes that both men will spend the rest of their lives punishing themselves with guilt and fear. The devastated Bruno\u2014with his security destroyed and realising that he will have no support or love from Guy\u2014commits suicide in front of Guy by climbing onto a railway track where he is killed by an oncoming train. Anne persuades Guy to put the whole matter behind him and to resume his career in architecture.\nA 2009 episode of the ABC series Castle titled \"Double Down\" loosely follows the plot of the novel, which is mentioned in the episode.\nA 2013 episode of the TNT series Rizzoli & Isles titled \"Partners in Crime\" loosely follows the plot of the novel, which is mentioned in the episode.\nMurdoch Mysteries season 7 episode 12 \"Unfinished Business\"  uses the same double unrelated murders plot.\nJ. D. Robb's book, Strangers in Death (2008) references both Highsmith's novel and Hitchcock's film as a homicide detective attempts to solve two seemingly unrelated murders.\nThe 1987 film Throw Momma from the Train provides a comedic twist on Strangers on a Train, with the Hitchcock film inspiring a copy-cat scheme by Danny DeVito's character.\nPeter Swanson's 2020 novel Eight Perfect Murders discusses the book extensively and uses it as a key plot point.\nA 2011 Episode on the crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, the episode \"Tell-Tale Hearts\" puts three strangers together to commit quadruple murder.\nThe 2004 episode of the police procedural \"Law & Order\" C.O.D. involves 2 women who conspire to kill each others husbands.\n\"Books"

Court Gentry goes to the town of Ushkovo in Russia to assassinate Gregor Sidorenko, a Russian crime boss and his former handler who wants him killed after a double cross from an operation in Sudan. Unbeknownst to Gentry, an American private contractor agency, Townsend Government Services, has been tracking him across Europe for a while and has found him while surveilling Sidorenko's house at the time of his assassination. After Gentry kills Sidorenko, Townsend House head Leland Babbitt brings in highly skilled assassin Russell \"Russ\" Whitlock, code-named Dead Eye, to track Gentry down and kill him.\nRuss, who operates alone, tracks down Gentry to a hotel in Tallinn, Estonia and informs the Townsend House. An eight-man strike team was then dispatched to kill Gentry, but in a fit of irony, Russ, posing as a bounty hunter coming to help him, warns Gentry of the operation to kill him. They escape the hotel and fight off the pursuing strike team, killing seven of them (the other one was later hospitalized and arrested, others were killed by Russ alone in order to silence them). Russ was wounded in the crossfire, and Court later treats his wound. \nRuss reveals the truth partially to Court in order to assuage his suspicions. It has been told that he was also in the Autonomous Asset Development Program, which was a secret assassination training program from years ago, as Gentry did. Later, Russ offers to help Gentry in his work as an assassin, which Gentry initially refuses. They later part ways, with Russ giving Gentry his contact number and later Court going to Stockholm, Sweden to lay low for a while.\nBack in the United States, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Gentry's former agency, has been wanting him dead since they betrayed him. Director of the CIA's National Clandestine Service Denny Carmichael visits the Townsend House and berates Babbitt for the failed operation in Tallinn. He urges him to exhaust more resources to track down the Gray Man in Europe and kill him, further hinting that a country that has good relations with the U.S. wants him dead in order to safeguard their relations.\nMeanwhile, Russ goes to an Iranian intelligence outpost in Beirut, Lebanon and uses Court's identity as the Gray Man, hoping to score a contract job from the Quds Force, Iran's special forces unit, to assassinate the prime minister of Israel Ehud Kalb, who was seen as a threat to their country over oil interests, in the process setting up Court as the fall guy. The Iranian intelligence officer present, Ali Hussein, was initially skeptical of his willingness to do such an operation, but Russ makes them propose a counteroffer to him: assassinate any public figure who is seen to Iran as a problem. Hussein accepts his suggestion, and gives him his first target: Amir Zarini, a filmmaker whose films have insulted the Iranian government by blaspheming Islam.\nAn Israeli intelligence asset has discovered an assassination plot to their prime minister set in motion by Iranian intelligence, and their plan to hire Russ as the assassin (they report it as the Gray Man). This prompts Mossad intelligence agent Ruth Ettinger to be called in by the CIA and later, the Townsend House for the three agencies to coordinate in tracking down Gentry before he is supposed to kill the Israeli PM. An intrepid operative, Ettinger surmises that it is not Gentry's style to undertake a hit on a head of state, which was dismissed by the Townsend House as over the motive of money. Later, a sighting of Gentry in Stockholm prompts Ruth to go there with her team of Mossad intelligence agents to coordinate with Townsend House's drone team already stationed there. \nThe next day, the Townsend House drone spots Gentry on the streets, prompting Ruth and her colleagues to follow him. They identify the house where he's been staying, but Ruth decides to minimize their surveillance in order to be certain of his intentions. Later that early morning, another strike team has been dispatched by Townsend House to Stockholm to find and kill Gentry in his supposed hideaway. Still embittered by her Mossad op gone awry in Rome the previous year, Ruth opposes the immediate action, implying on the collateral damage likely to be inflicted, but the strike team and their boss Babbitt dismiss her. She later finds Gentry leaving his hideaway, and decides to tail him. She later halted her surveillance and decides not to tell her colleagues and the Townsend House operatives about what happened.\nMeanwhile in Nice, France, Russ goes forward with his assassination of filmmaker Amir"

Set in 1818, the story is a sequel to the events seen in Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice. Fitzwilliam Darcy embarks for Constantinople to begin a diplomatic post, accompanied by his wife Elizabeth Bennet. In their absence, the couple's five wealthy daughters stay in London with their cousin, Mr Fitzwilliam. Aged 21 to 16, the sisters are prim and proper Letitia, witty Camilla, frivolous twins Georgina and Isabelle, and musical prodigy Alethea. Two younger brothers remain behind at the Darcy estate, Pemberley.\nLetitia is dismayed to learn that her former fianc\u00e9, a man she thought dead for three years, is alive and married but apparently with no memory. Her emotional reaction, highly unfashionable, attracts unwanted gossip among London's elite. Meanwhile, Camilla befriends Sir Sidney Leigh and believes herself in love. Perceiving that he is not attracted to her, Camilla is shocked when he asks Fitzwilliam for her hand in marriage. However, she breaks off the engagement when a friend warns her that Leigh is a homosexual. Leigh flees the country for Italy due to laws banning sodomy, while negative rumours spread about Camilla's too obvious attachment to the man.\nCamilla meets Mr Wytton, the fianc\u00e9 of her rich cousin Sophie Gardiner. Wittily sarcastic, he enjoys archaeology and travelling to the continent, interests Sophie cares little for. Camilla finds him intelligent but saturnine and intolerant of clever women. Over time it becomes clear that he and Sophie are ill-matched, as she prefer frivolous subjects like fashion.\nAlethea begins learning from an Italian maestro, to the dismay of Letitia who believes her sister is going too far with her musical interests. Later, Camilla catches Alethea among musicians at a ball, dressed as a boy and playing the flute. With the help of Wytton, they are able to avoid scandal by quietly sending Alethea home in a carriage.\nCaroline Bingley, now known as Lady Warren, spreads the malevolent rumour that Camilla desires to marry Wytton herself. Soon after, Georgina elopes to France with Sir Joshua Mordaunt, causing Camilla and Mr Gardiner to follow in the hopes of bringing Georgina home before scandal arises. They are surprised to encounter Wytton, who helps them find the eloping couple, now married. Camilla and Gardiner return home, only to discover that Isabelle has also eloped. Sophie angrily assumes that Isabelle is going to marry a Captain Allington, revealing that she is in love with Allington. Sophie releases Wytton from the engagement, leaving him free to marry Camilla whom he has gradually come to love throughout the story.\nThe release of the popular TV serial Pride and Prejudice (1995) led to a resurgence in interest for Jane Austen's works. Many writers were inspired by Austen, leading to a variety of novelizations and other adaptations being produced. Elizabeth Aston became one of the most prolific authors of Austen-related fiction. She had studied the author at St Hilda's College, Oxford under Lord David Cecil, a biographer of Austen. Aston felt that Austen's novels were \"as fresh today as when they were written,\" and compared the novelist's genius with Mozart for \"speak[ing] to the soul while it enchants and delights.\" When crafting her story, Aston opted not to prominently feature Austen characters such as Mr Darcy. Her stories instead feature newly invented characters related to those seen in Austen's works, such as members of the Darcy, Bingley, and Collins families.\nMr. Darcy's Daughters was published in 2003 by Simon & Schuster. Its success encouraged the publisher to release other novels adapted from Austen's stories, including Pamela Aidan's Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman series. A Dutch translation was released in 2003, followed by a Czech edition in 2009. It was followed by The Exploits & Adventures of Miss Alethea Darcy, released in 2004.\nIn a review of the novel, Publishers Weekly opines that it \"reads more like a beach book for historical fiction fans than a literary homage to Austen's masterpiece,\" and feels the daughters were predictably written. The reviewer also critiques Aston for having little success at imitating Austen's style, believing the novel's prose to be \"stilted and anachronistic\". Paige Wiser, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, notes that Aston pens her story in Austen's style, with a respectable result of \"great characters, great comic moments, great romance\". In 2013, Aja Romano of The Daily Dot listed it among the best Austen adaptations. It has been classified as fan fiction by several commentators.\nList of literary adaptations of Pride and Prejudice\n\"Mr. Darcy's Daughters\". Publishers Weekly. 14 April 2003. Retrieved 25 May"

The novel follows the three Dashwood sisters as they must move with their widowed mother from the estate on which they grew up, Norland Park.

Henry Dashwood, his second wife, and their three daughters live for many years with Henry's wealthy bachelor uncle at Norland Park, a large country estate in Sussex. That uncle decides, in late life, to will the use and income only of his property first to Henry, then to Henry's first son (by his first marriage) John Dashwood, so that the property should pass intact to John's four-year-old son Harry. The uncle dies, but Henry lives just a year after that and he is unable in such short time to save enough money for his wife Mrs Dashwood, and their daughters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, who are left only a small income. On his deathbed, Mr Henry Dashwood extracts a promise from his son John to take care of his half-sisters. But before Henry is long in the grave, John's greedy wife, Fanny, persuades her husband to renege on the promise, appealing to his concerns about diminishing his own son Harry's inheritance, despite the fact that John is already independently wealthy thanks to both his inheritance from his mother and his wife's dowry. Henry Dashwood's love for his second family is also used by Fanny to arouse her husband's jealousy, and persuade him not to help his sisters financially.\nJohn and Fanny immediately move in as the new owners of Norland, while the Dashwood women are treated as unwelcome guests by a spiteful Fanny. Mrs Dashwood seeks somewhere else to live. In the meantime, Fanny's brother, Edward Ferrars, visits Norland and is attracted to Elinor. Fanny disapproves of their budding romance, and offends Mrs Dashwood by implying that Elinor must be motivated by his expectations of coming into money.\nMrs Dashwood moves her family to Barton Cottage in Devonshire, near the home of her cousin, Sir John Middleton. Their new home is modest, but they are warmly received by Sir John and welcomed into local society, meeting his wife, Lady Middleton, his mother-in-law, the garrulous but well-meaning Mrs Jennings, and his friend, Colonel Brandon. Colonel Brandon is attracted to Marianne, and Mrs Jennings teases them about it. Marianne is not pleased, as she considers the thirty-five-year-old Colonel Brandon an old bachelor, incapable of falling in love or inspiring love in anyone.\nWhile out for a walk, Marianne gets caught in the rain, slips, and sprains her ankle. The dashing John Willoughby sees the accident and assists her, picking her up and carrying her back to her home. After his rescue of her, Marianne quickly comes to admire his good looks and his similar tastes in poetry, music, art, and love. His attentions, and Marianne's behaviour, lead Elinor and Mrs Dashwood to suspect that the couple are secretly engaged. Elinor cautions Marianne against her unguarded conduct, but Marianne refuses to check her emotions. Willoughby engages in several intimate activities with Marianne, including taking her to see the home he expects to inherit one day and obtaining a lock of her hair. When an engagement, or at least the announcement of one, seems imminent, Mr Willoughby instead informs the Dashwoods that his aunt, upon whom he is financially dependent, is sending him to London on business, indefinitely. Marianne is distraught and abandons herself to her sorrow.\nEdward Ferrars pays a short visit to Barton Cottage, but seems unhappy. Elinor fears that he no longer has feelings for her, but she will not show her heartache. After Edward departs, sisters Anne and Lucy Steele, vulgar cousins of Mrs. Jennings, come to stay at Barton Park. Lucy informs Elinor in confidence of her secret four-year engagement to Edward Ferrars that started when he was studying with her uncle, and she displays proof of their intimacy. Elinor realises Lucy's visit and revelations are the result of her jealousy and cunning calculation, and it helps Elinor to understand Edward's recent sadness and behaviour towards her. She acquits Edward of blame and pities him for being held to a loveless engagement to Lucy by his sense of honour.\nElinor and Marianne accompany Mrs Jennings to London. On arriving, Marianne rashly writes several personal letters to Willoughby, which go unanswered. When they meet by chance at a dance, Willoughby is with another woman. He greets Marianne reluctantly and coldly, to her extreme distress. She leaves the party completely distraught. Soon Marianne receives a curt letter enclosing their former correspondence and love tokens, including the lock of her hair. Willoughby is revealed to be engaged to a young lady, Miss Grey, who has a large fortune. Marianne is devastated. After Elinor reads the letter, Marianne admits to Elinor that she and Willoughby were never engaged."

Trail of Lightning is a 2018 fantasy novel, the debut novel by Rebecca Roanhorse. After a supernatural disaster destroys most of North America, Navajo monster-slayer Maggie Hoskie must navigate a world of monsters and gods. The novel won the 2019 Locus Award for Best First Novel and was nominated for the Hugo, World Fantasy, and Locus Awards for Best Novel.\nRebecca Roanhorse began writing fantasy as a hobby while pursuing a career as a lawyer. She stated that when she was unable to find a science fiction or fantasy novel with a Native American protagonist, she decided to write one. Roanhorse is Black and Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo, but she decided to write a story based on Navajo culture because her daughter is Navajo on her father's side. Roanhorse believes that many Native American fictional characters are portrayed as stuck in the past, and she wanted to use her novel to show Native characters as \"alive and thriving\".\nTrail of Lightning received mostly positive critical reviews. The Verge called it a \"much-needed perspective to the larger canon of fantasy fiction\", praising it for its portrayal of Native American characters. Critics also praised Trail of Lightning for its fast-paced action and complex characters. Locus called the novel \"immensely readable and very enjoyable\" and praised it for its worldbuilding; it also criticized the novel for shallow dialogue and a disjointed plot structure.\nThe Din\u00e9 Writers' Collective criticized the novel as cultural appropriation, stating that someone not of Din\u00e9 ancestry \"does not have the authority or experience to write about our people and culture\". They feel that important Navajo spiritual beliefs were portrayed inaccurately. They also criticized the way in which some book reviewers have conflated different tribes of Native Americans into one identity.\nTrail of Lightning won the 2019 Locus Award for Best First Novel,  and was a finalist for the Nebula Award for Best Novel of 2018, the 2019 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel, and the 2019 Hugo Award for Best Novel.\nKyle Muzyka (14 April 2019). \"A correction of stereotypes: Rebecca Roanhorse's post-apocalyptic books draw on Indigenous experience\".

                "description": "After her mother was murdered by a yellow hair warrior and her family's house on the island of Shalott was burned to ashes, the 8-year-old Elaine of Ascolat goes to live with her two brothers, Lavain and Tirry, and her father in a British army encampment. She quickly makes friends with many of the camp's occupants, including Arthur, Lancelot, Tristan, and Gawain. Over the years Elaine grows into a beautiful 16-year-old girl and performs all of the menial, household tasks and healing for the camp's soldiers. She also falls in love with her childhood playmate Lancelot, who has become Arthur's right-hand man- a position made even more important after Arthur is forced to assume leadership after the camp's leader Aurelius is poisoned. ...",

The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books and Kliatt both praised the work, with the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books writing \"Even with the feminine perspective and heavy emphasis on love, the effectively creepy descriptions of the prophesying Merlin, the terse metaphors of blood and war, and the undeniable masculinity of the camp are effective selling points to extend the audience.\" The Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy praised the work for its easy to understand language and recommended it as a companion piece to other works about Arthurian legends. Booklist gave Song of the Sparrow a mixed review, criticizing its \"improbable conclusion\" and commenting that its \"distilled nature does not always allow for the rich detail and development that many readers seek in historical fiction\" while also remarking that \"the unadorned writing style reflects Sandell's magic-flee interpretations, rooting the characters in the bloody business of pre-Camelot power wrangling.\"\nArthurian Literature, Issue 26.

Trail of Lightning is a 2018 fantasy novel, the debut novel by Rebecca Roanhorse. After a supernatural disaster destroys most of North America, Navajo monster-slayer Maggie Hoskie must navigate a world of monsters and gods. The novel won the 2019 Locus Award for Best First Novel and was nominated for the Hugo, World Fantasy, and Locus Awards for Best Novel.\nRebecca Roanhorse began writing fantasy as a hobby while pursuing a career as a lawyer. She stated that when she was unable to find a science fiction or fantasy novel with a Native American protagonist, she decided to write one. Roanhorse is Black and Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo, but she decided to write a story based on Navajo culture because her daughter is Navajo on her father's side. Roanhorse believes that many Native American fictional characters are portrayed as stuck in the past, and she wanted to use her novel to show Native characters as \"alive and thriving\".\nTrail of Lightning received mostly positive critical reviews. The Verge called it a \"much-needed perspective to the larger canon of fantasy fiction\", praising it for its portrayal of Native American characters. Critics also praised Trail of Lightning for its fast-paced action and complex characters. Locus called the novel \"immensely readable and very enjoyable\" and praised it for its worldbuilding; it also criticized the novel for shallow dialogue and a disjointed plot structure.\nThe Din\u00e9 Writers' Collective criticized the novel as cultural appropriation, stating that someone not of Din\u00e9 ancestry \"does not have the authority or experience to write about our people and culture\". They feel that important Navajo spiritual beliefs were portrayed inaccurately. They also criticized the way in which some book reviewers have conflated different tribes of Native Americans into one identity.\nTrail of Lightning won the 2019 Locus Award for Best First Novel,  and was a finalist for the Nebula Award for Best Novel of 2018, the 2019 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel, and the 2019 Hugo Award for Best Novel.\nKyle Muzyka (14 April 2019). \"A correction of stereotypes: Rebecca Roanhorse's post-apocalyptic books draw on Indigenous experience\".

In the book, Trump expresses anti-illegal-immigration views similar to those that he espoused when he ran for president successfully in 2016. For example, he wrote, \"A liberal policy of immigration may seem to reflect confidence and generosity. But our current laxness toward illegal immigration shows a recklessness and disregard for those who live here legally.\"\nHowever, Trump also endorsed some proposals he would abandon by 2016. For example, Trump  proposed a 14.25% tax on individuals and trusts valued at more than $10 million. Trump also wrote in the book supporting a universal health care system.\nDuring his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump frequently cited the book on the campaign trail as proof that he predicted the September 11 attacks. This is because he mentioned Osama Bin Laden in the book; however, Trump did not predict that Bin Laden would commit a terrorist attack against the United States in the book. Trump also falsely claimed (for instance, in a 2015 interview with Alex Jones) that Bin Laden was not very well known in 2000, and that in the book, Trump personally called for someone to \"take him out\".\nIn the February 2000 issue of The American Spectator, Shiflett wrote that the book \"will appeal to the established Trump constituency, but also hopes to show the author as worthy of wider support.\"\nBibliography of Donald Trump\nTime to Get Tough\nCrippled America\nSankin, Aaron (2015-08-23). \"Donald Trump's 15-year-old book on public policy reveals what kind of president he'd be\".

It sold over 400,000 copies in the first eighteen years and more than half a million since 1962. It has been translated into eighteen languages. Friedman argues for economic freedom as a precondition for political freedom. He defines \"liberal\" in European Enlightenment terms, contrasting with an American usage that he believes has been corrupted since the Great Depression. The book identifies several places in which a free market can be promoted for both philosophical and practical reasons. ...",

Capitalism and Freedom was published nearly two decades after World War II, a time when the Great Depression was still in collective memory. Under the Kennedy and preceding Eisenhower administrations, federal expenditures were growing at a quick pace in the areas of national defense, social welfare, and infrastructure. Both major parties, Democratic and Republican, supported increased spending in different ways. This, as well as the New Deal, was supported by most intellectuals with the justification of Keynesian economics. Capitalism and Freedom introduces the idea of how competitive capitalism can help to achieve economic freedom.\nThe book drew inspiration from a series of lectures Friedman gave in June 1956 at Wabash College.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction lays out the principles of Friedman's archetypal liberal, a man who supports limited and dispersed governmental power. Friedman opts for the continental European, rather than American, definition of the term.\ni. The Relation between Economic Freedom and Political Freedom\nIn this chapter, Friedman promotes economic freedom as both a necessary freedom and also as a vital means for political freedom. He argues that, with the means for production under the auspices of the government, it is nearly impossible for real dissent and exchange of ideas to exist. Additionally, economic freedom is important, since any \"bi-laterally voluntary and informed\" transaction must benefit both parties to the transaction. Friedman states that economic freedom protects minorities from discrimination since the market is apathetic to, \"their views or color.\"\nii. The Role of Government in a Free Society\nAccording to the author, the government of a liberal society should enforce law and order and property rights, as well as take action on certain technical monopolies and diminish negative \"neighborhood effects.\" The government should also have control over money, as has long been recognized in the constitution and society.\niii. The Control of Money\nHe discusses the evolution of money in America, culminating in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Far from acting as a stabilizer, the Federal Reserve failed to act as it should have in several circumstances. Friedman proposes that the Federal Reserve have a consistent rule to increase the money supply by 3\u20135% annually.\niv. International Financial and Trade Arrangements\nThis chapter advocates the end of the Bretton Woods system in favor of a floating exchange rate system and the end of all currency controls and trade barriers, even \"voluntary\" export quotas. Friedman says that this is the only true solution to the balance of trades problem.\nv. Fiscal Policy\nFriedman argues against the continual government spending justified to \"balance the wheel\" and help the economy to continue to grow. On the contrary, federal government expenditures make the economy less, not more stable. Friedman uses concrete evidence from his own research, demonstrating that the rise in government expenditures results in a roughly equal rise in GDP, contrasting with the Keynesian multiplier theory. Many reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.\nvi. The Role of Government in Education\nThe policy advocated here is vouchers which students may use for education at a school of their choice. The author believes that everyone, in a democracy, needs a basic education for citizenship. Though there is underinvestment in human capital (in terms of spending at technical and professional schools), it would be foolish of the government to provide free technical education. The author suggests several solutions, some private, some public, to stop this underinvestment.\nvii. Capitalism and Discrimination\nIn a capitalist society, Friedman argues, it costs money to discriminate, and it is very difficult, given the impersonal nature of market transactions. However, the government should not make fair employment practices laws (eventually embodied in the Civil Rights Act of 1964), as these inhibit the freedom to employ someone based on whatever qualifications the employer wishes to use. For the same reason, right-to-work laws should be abolished.\nviii. Monopoly and the Social Responsibility of Business and Labor\nFriedman states, there are three alternatives for a monopoly: public monopoly, private monopoly, or public regulation. None of these is desirable or universally preferable. Monopolies come from many sources, but direct and indirect government intervention is the most common, and it should be stopped wherever possible."

Toilers of the Sea (French: Les Travailleurs de la mer) is a novel by Victor Hugo published in 1866.  The book is dedicated to the island of Guernsey, where Hugo spent 15 years in exile. Hugo uses the setting of a small island community to transmute seemingly mundane events into drama of the highest calibre.  Les Travailleurs de la Mer is set just after the Napoleonic Wars and deals with the impact of the Industrial Revolution upon the island.\nThe story concerns a Guernseyman named Gilliatt, a social outcast who falls in love with Deruchette, the niece of a local shipowner, Mess Lethierry. When Lethierry's ship is wrecked on the double Douvres, a perilous reef, Deruchette promises to marry whoever can salvage the ship's steam engine. (The cliff of the double Douvres is not the same as the well-known and also dangerous Roches Douvres, which today has a lighthouse - Hugo himself draws attention to this in the work.) Gilliatt eagerly volunteers, and the story follows his physical trials and tribulations (which include a battle with an octopus), as well as the undeserved opprobrium of his neighbours.\nGilliatt: a fisherman\nMess Lethierry: owner of the ship Durande, the island's first steam ship\nD\u00e9ruchette: Mess Lethierry's young niece\nSieur Clubin: captain of the Durande\nEbenezer Caudray: young Anglican priest, recently arrived on the island\nThe novel is credited with introducing the Guern\u00e9siais word for octopus (pieuvre) into the French language (standard French for octopus is poulpe).\nIn the 2010s, locals conducted research on the circumstances under which the novel originated, using Hugo\u2019s unpublished notes as well. They found that the Douvre double rock did not exist, but its model image did: it was modeled by Hugo on the so-called Les Autelets on the island of Sark (and the coast). And the fight with the octopus was inspired by a real polyp attack that took place here.\nThe following dedication appears at the front of the book:\nJe d\u00e9die ce livre au rocher d'hospitalit\u00e9 et de libert\u00e9, \u00e0 ce coin de vieille terre normande o\u00f9 vit le noble petit peuple de la mer, \u00e0 l'\u00eele de Guernesey, s\u00e9v\u00e8re et douce, mon asile actuel, mon tombeau probable.\n(I dedicate this book to the rock of hospitality and liberty, to that portion of old Norman ground inhabited by the noble little nation of the sea, to the island of Guernsey, severe yet kind, my present asylum, my probable tomb.)\nThe novel was first published in Brussels in 1866 (Hugo was in exile from France). An English translation quickly appeared in New York later that year, under the title The Toilers of the Sea. A UK edition followed in 1887, with Ward Lock publishing Sir G Campbell's translation under the title Workers of the Sea followed by an 1896 Routledge edition under the title Toilers of the Sea.\nHugo had originally intended his essay L'Archipel de la Manche (The Archipelago of the [English] Channel) as an introduction to this novel, although it was not published until 1883, and the two have only been published together in the 20th century.\nIn 2002, Modern Library published an edition with a new translation by James Hogarth, which bills itself as \"the first unabridged English edition of the novel\".\nThere have been at least five film adaptations of the novel, including:\nToilers of the Sea (1914 film) \u2013 director unknown (silent)\nToilers of the Sea (1915 film) \u2013 director unknown (silent)\nToilers of the Sea (1923 film) \u2013 director Roy William Neill (silent)\nToilers of the Sea (1936 film) \u2013 director Selwyn Jepson\nSea Devils (1953 film) \u2013 director Raoul Walsh\nVictor Hugo in Guernsey\nToilers of the Sea\nPieuvre - Centre National des Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales\nhttps://guernseypress.com/news/features/2019/06/19/hugo-in-sark-notes-from-a-smaller-island/\nJosephson, Matthew (1961). \"Introduction\".

And the fight with the octopus was inspired by a real polyp attack that took place here.\nThe following dedication appears at the front of the book:\nJe d\u00e9die ce livre au rocher d'hospitalit\u00e9 et de libert\u00e9, \u00e0 ce coin de vieille terre normande o\u00f9 vit le noble petit peuple de la mer, \u00e0 l'\u00eele de Guernesey, s\u00e9v\u00e8re et douce, mon asile actuel, mon tombeau probable.\n(I dedicate this book to the rock of hospitality and liberty, to that portion of old Norman ground inhabited by the noble little nation of the sea, to the island of Guernsey, severe yet kind, my present asylum, my probable tomb.)\nThe novel was first published in Brussels in 1866 (Hugo was in exile from France). An English translation quickly appeared in New York later that year, under the title The Toilers of the Sea. A UK edition followed in 1887, with Ward Lock publishing Sir G Campbell's translation under the title Workers of the Sea followed by an 1896 Routledge edition under the title Toilers of the Sea.\nHugo had originally intended his essay L'Archipel de la Manche (The Archipelago of the [English] Channel) as an introduction to this novel, although it was not published until 1883, and the two have only been published together in the 20th century.\nIn 2002, Modern Library published an edition with a new translation by James Hogarth, which bills itself as \"the first unabridged English edition of the novel\".\nThere have been at least five film adaptations of the novel, including:\nToilers of the Sea (1914 film) \u2013 director unknown (silent)\nToilers of the Sea (1915 film) \u2013 director unknown (silent)\nToilers of the Sea (1923 film) \u2013 director Roy William Neill (silent)\nToilers of the Sea (1936 film) \u2013 director Selwyn Jepson\nSea Devils (1953 film) \u2013 director Raoul Walsh\nVictor Hugo in Guernsey\nToilers of the Sea\nPieuvre - Centre National des Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales\nhttps://guernseypress.com/news/features/2019/06/19/hugo-in-sark-notes-from-a-smaller-island/\nJosephson, Matthew (1961). \"Introduction\".

A prologue relates two events in 1949 in the Soviet Union marking the beginning of the Cold War: the first Soviet nuclear test and innovation in the development of the automatic rifle; the former made total war unwinnable and the latter made smaller proxy wars the principle activity of the Cold War, and automatic rifles would prove the most lethal weapons of the Cold War.\nRoughly the first third of the book is devoted to the history of the development of automatic firearms, including the biographies of Hiram Maxim, Richard Gatling, Paul Mauser, John T. Thompson, their eponymous automatic weapons, and their impact on warfare.\nChivers deconstructs the Soviet origin mythology of the Kalashnikov rifle. Chivers draws in part from his interview of Mikhail Kalashnikov.\nRoughly the final third of the book covers the contest between the AK-47 and the M16 in the Vietnam War, and the spread of the adoption of the AK-47 by criminal, non-military, non-state actors.\nReviews were generally favorable. Reviewers contrasted the broad scope of the book (automatic rifles) with its nominal scope (the Kalashnikov rifles), and noted the coverage of both technical aspects and social impacts and that the narrative is a human story, involving inventors, generals, and casualties. According to reviewers, Chivers' experiences as Marine, journalist, and weapons expert informed the work. The most common criticism  was that some topics were considered diversions by reviewers who took the central topic to be the development of the Kalashnikov pattern or the contest between the AK-47 and the United States' M16 in the Vietnam War.\nChivers, C.

The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter explores the references to history, legends, and literature in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels. David Colbert, the author of the book, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the Harry Potter novels \"are [...] literary treasure hunts for [Rowling's] readers. What seem like funny-sounding names and places and excursions into fantasy all have a basis in either history, myth or legend.\" He added, however, that he thinks Rowling has been able to turn these elements into her own, and concluded: \"A couple of times, every generation, some writer gets it exactly right and really makes it their own, and J.K. Rowling has done that.\"\nThe 220-pages-long book features 53 chapters. Colbert writes about the connections between Rowling's novels and folklore, Greek mythology, and the cultures of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Rome, and the Aztec. For example, he explains that Rowling got the name for the character Draco Malfoy from the Latin word for dragon, draco. One of the connections to folklore that Colbert find the most fascinating is the name of the evil wizard family The Malfoys. They are named after the Latin word for \"evil-doer\", maleficus, which was used in medieval times to describe witches. In addition, there is a chapter in the book that explains the origins of the names of the spells featured in the Harry Potter series.\nColbert explains in the introduction of the book that one of the reasons he enjoys reading Rowling is because of these references that she hides in the novels. He comments that he believes she may have inserted them into the books to encourage readers to learn more about mythology and folklore; \"As [Rowling] said when somebody asked her in a chat about the source of one of the unforgivable curses [featured in the books], she said, 'Look it up, a little investigation is good for a person.'\"\nColbert received the idea for The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter during the summer of 2000, when his young nephew and nieces spent their vacation at his home in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. During the first half of the children's vacation, Colbert noticed their excitement for the novel Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which was about to be released in bookstores. When his nephew and nieces received the book, they read it for the remainder of their vacation with him.\nColbert, a historian and former head writer on the television quiz show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, became interested in the books and bought the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, to see what the story was about. As he was reading, he began to notice mythological references in the book. He commented: \"I almost laughed out loud when I came across the three-headed dog [Fluffy]. I instantly knew it was a reference to Cerberus, the threeheaded beast which Ancient Greeks believed guarded the gates to the Underworld.\" Inspired by this, Colbert continued to search the book for more references and noticed that most characters' names are based on their personality and every magic creature is a reference to mythology and folklore.\nExcited about his discoveries, Colbert began quizzing his nephew and nieces about the references featured in the books. He started by asking them if they knew who Fluffy was based on, and when revealing that the answer was Cerberus, they \"gave him a blank stare\". Soon, however, the children thought it was \"cool that their hero, Harry, was encountering some of the creatures of mythology.\" Colbert felt that knowing the origins of Rowling's character and creatures increased \"the books' magic tenfold\" and made the Harry Potter universe seem more lifelike. Feeling that he wanted to share this with others, Colbert spent a year researching the references in the novels and collected his discoveries for a guidebook to the magical world of Harry Potter.\nColbert wrote The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter while teaching a seminar on self-publishing to graduate students at the University of North Carolina. He had it self-published in March 2001 and hired a company to take care of accounting, marketing, promotion, and selling. Colbert has never met Rowling and the book has not been approved by her or Warner Brothers (the owner of the film rights to the Harry Potter novels). He was given permission to publish it as long as he noted on the cover that it had not been approved by Rowling.\nThe book has been"

The book uses the frame story literary device; the frame is presented in first-person narration as the remembrances of an elderly woman in 1995, whose name is initially not revealed to the reader. It is only known that she has a son named Julien and that she lives off the coast of Oregon. However, the main action of the book is told in third-person, following two sisters, Vianne Mauriac and Isabelle Rossignol, who live in France around 1939, on the eve of World War II. The two sisters are estranged from each other and their father, and the book follows the two different paths they take.\nVianne, the eldest sister, is a married schoolteacher raising her 8-year-old daughter Sophie in her childhood home named Le Jardin in the town of Carriveau. Vianne's husband Antoine is drafted and subsequently captured as a prisoner of war. At home, Vianne copes with the occupation of France by the Germans after the Battle of France, struggling to keep herself and her daughter alive in the face of poor food rations, the dwindling francs left behind by Antoine, the billeting of Wehrmacht and SS officers at her home, the loss of her job, and the increasing persecution of the Jews in the town. The first officer billeted at her home is Wolfgang Beck, a kindly man with a family he's left behind. The second is Von Richter, a more sadistic officer who subjects Vianne to physical and sexual abuse. \nLater in the novel when Vianne's best friend, Rachel de Champlain, is deported to a concentration camp, she adopts Rachel's three-year-old son, Ari, and renames him \"Daniel\" to hide his Jewish identity. Soon after, Vianne becomes responsible for hiding nineteen more Jewish children in a nearby abbey's orphanage. Meanwhile, Von Richter uses sexual violence as a means of control over Vianne. When the war ends, Antoine returns from the POW camp, but Vianne must still cope with the aftermath of the occupation\u2014she is pregnant as a result of Von Richter's rape, and Ari, whom she has come to love as a son, is taken away to be raised by his cousins in the United States.\nIsabelle, the younger and more impetuous sister, decides to take an active role in resisting the occupation. After being expelled from finishing school, she travels from Paris to Carriveau on foot, meeting a young rebel named Ga\u00ebtan Dubois along the way. In Carriveau, she joins the French Resistance and is initially tasked with distributing anti-Nazi propaganda. After moving to a cell in Paris, she develops a plan to help downed Allied airmen escape to the British embassy in neutral Spain, where they can be repatriated. She is successful, and with support from other Resistance operators (including her father, with whom she begins to rebuild a relationship) and the British MI9, this becomes her primary task throughout the war. She earns the code name \"Nightingale\", and is actively hunted by the Nazis. She is eventually captured, and after her father falsely confesses to being the Nightingale to save her, she is sent to a concentration camp in Germany. She undergoes hellish conditions at the camp but survives long enough to see the end of the war. She makes her way to Vianne, and they reconcile. She reunites with Ga\u00ebtan once more before dying from the typhus and pneumonia she has contracted as a result of her mistreatment.\nThe book concludes with the elderly narrator, revealed to be Vianne, receiving an invitation to an event in Paris to remember her sister, \"The Nightingale\". She travels with her son Julien, who is unaware of his family's activities during the war and his true parentage. After the event, Vianne reunites with Ari, and she comes to peace with her memories of the war.\nThe characters in The Nightingale are not themselves real people, though some of their actions are based on real historical figures. Isabelle's escape route over the Pyrenees for downed Allied airmen was based on the Comet line of 24-year-old Andr\u00e9e de Jongh,  a Belgian woman who helped aviators and others escape. Much like Isabelle, de Jongh personally escorted many over the Pyrenees on foot; by the end of the war, she had aided 118 airmen. Also like Isabelle, de Jongh was captured late in the war and sent to the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp rather than executed, as the Nazis disbelieved her assertion that she was herself the organizer of the route. However, de Jongh lived on long after the war, becoming a countess in 1985 and eventually dying in 2007, whereas in the novel Isabelle dies shortly after being freed from the camp. \nThe story of De Jongh also inspired Hannah to conduct further research and found stories during the French Resistance about women who were willing to put their"

The book uses the frame story literary device; the frame is presented in first-person narration as the remembrances of an elderly woman in 1995, whose name is initially not revealed to the reader. It is only known that she has a son named Julien and that she lives off the coast of Oregon. However, the main action of the book is told in third-person, following two sisters, Vianne Mauriac and Isabelle Rossignol, who live in France around 1939, on the eve of World War II. The two sisters are estranged from each other and their father, and the book follows the two different paths they take.\nVianne, the eldest sister, is a married schoolteacher raising her 8-year-old daughter Sophie in her childhood home named Le Jardin in the town of Carriveau. Vianne's husband Antoine is drafted and subsequently captured as a prisoner of war. At home, Vianne copes with the occupation of France by the Germans after the Battle of France, struggling to keep herself and her daughter alive in the face of poor food rations, the dwindling francs left behind by Antoine, the billeting of Wehrmacht and SS officers at her home, the loss of her job, and the increasing persecution of the Jews in the town. The first officer billeted at her home is Wolfgang Beck, a kindly man with a family he's left behind. The second is Von Richter, a more sadistic officer who subjects Vianne to physical and sexual abuse. \nLater in the novel when Vianne's best friend, Rachel de Champlain, is deported to a concentration camp, she adopts Rachel's three-year-old son, Ari, and renames him \"Daniel\" to hide his Jewish identity. Soon after, Vianne becomes responsible for hiding nineteen more Jewish children in a nearby abbey's orphanage. Meanwhile, Von Richter uses sexual violence as a means of control over Vianne. When the war ends, Antoine returns from the POW camp, but Vianne must still cope with the aftermath of the occupation\u2014she is pregnant as a result of Von Richter's rape, and Ari, whom she has come to love as a son, is taken away to be raised by his cousins in the United States.\nIsabelle, the younger and more impetuous sister, decides to take an active role in resisting the occupation. After being expelled from finishing school, she travels from Paris to Carriveau on foot, meeting a young rebel named Ga\u00ebtan Dubois along the way. In Carriveau, she joins the French Resistance and is initially tasked with distributing anti-Nazi propaganda. After moving to a cell in Paris, she develops a plan to help downed Allied airmen escape to the British embassy in neutral Spain, where they can be repatriated. She is successful, and with support from other Resistance operators (including her father, with whom she begins to rebuild a relationship) and the British MI9, this becomes her primary task throughout the war. She earns the code name \"Nightingale\", and is actively hunted by the Nazis. She is eventually captured, and after her father falsely confesses to being the Nightingale to save her, she is sent to a concentration camp in Germany. She undergoes hellish conditions at the camp but survives long enough to see the end of the war. She makes her way to Vianne, and they reconcile. She reunites with Ga\u00ebtan once more before dying from the typhus and pneumonia she has contracted as a result of her mistreatment.\nThe book concludes with the elderly narrator, revealed to be Vianne, receiving an invitation to an event in Paris to remember her sister, \"The Nightingale\". She travels with her son Julien, who is unaware of his family's activities during the war and his true parentage. After the event, Vianne reunites with Ari, and she comes to peace with her memories of the war.\nThe characters in The Nightingale are not themselves real people, though some of their actions are based on real historical figures. Isabelle's escape route over the Pyrenees for downed Allied airmen was based on the Comet line of 24-year-old Andr\u00e9e de Jongh,  a Belgian woman who helped aviators and others escape. Much like Isabelle, de Jongh personally escorted many over the Pyrenees on foot; by the end of the war, she had aided 118 airmen. Also like Isabelle, de Jongh was captured late in the war and sent to the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp rather than executed, as the Nazis disbelieved her assertion that she was herself the organizer of the route. However, de Jongh lived on long after the war, becoming a countess in 1985 and eventually dying in 2007, whereas in the novel Isabelle dies shortly after being freed from the camp. \nThe story of De Jongh also inspired Hannah to conduct further research and found stories during the French Resistance about women who were willing to put their"

Aremis Slake lives in a room underground in the subway station Grand Central \u2013 42nd Street. It soon becomes the home he has never known. He collects used newspapers off passing trains and makes a living selling them. He has two regular customers: the cleaning lady, and a man with a turban. A major theme throughout the book is Slake's low self-esteem and lack of experiences with empathy, which are dealt with throughout the course of the book.\nWith the money that he gets from doing this, he buys food from the local diner, and soon becomes a regular customer. The people at the luncheonette see him there every day and have sympathy for this homeless boy. They offer him a sweeping job and pay him with food sufficient to meet his needs. Also, whatever he finds on the floor he gets to keep, so Slake eventually has quite a collection of various items he's organized and used to decorate his cave.\nThere are also occasionally sections of the book entitled \"On Another Track\", about the parallel life of a man named Willis Joe Whinny.\nWillis Joe is a middle-class motor man who also has an internal dilemma. He conducts trains with the depressing mindset that people are like sheep, lacking the empathy essential for psychological health.\nAt the climax of the book, Willis Joe meets Slake and their paths coincide due to a railway accident that was thought to have been caused by holes in the subway walls. Terrified, Slake scrambles on the subway track because he has pneumonia and needs help, because his home was doomed to be sealed up due to repairs needed in the subway. He scrambles onto the track with a sign that says STOP and Willis Joe saves him, stopping the train with a determination he had not experienced for years.\nWhen Slake awakes in a hospital, he decides to flee for the rooftops. He sees his symbolic bird fly away, ending a miserable period in his life and signifying depression.\nHe then departs with renewed hopes and purposes.\nBerkvist, Robert (November 17, 1974). \"Slake's Limbo; A boy hiding, a father lost, a handicap to overcome\".

The novel centers on a wealthy family living in New Rochelle, New York, referred to as Father, Mother, Mother's Younger Brother, Grandfather, and 'the little boy', Father and Mother's young son. The family business is the manufacture of flags and fireworks, an easy source of wealth due to the national enthusiasm for patriotic displays. Father joins Robert Peary's expedition to the North Pole, and his return sees a change in his relationship with his wife, who has experienced independence in his absence. Mother's Younger Brother is a genius at explosives and fireworks but is an insecure, unhappy character who chases after love and excitement. He becomes obsessed with the notorious socialite Evelyn Nesbit, stalking her and embarking on a brief, unsatisfactory affair with her.\nInto this insecure setup comes an abandoned black child, then his severely depressed mother, Sarah. Coalhouse Walker, the child's father, visits regularly to win Sarah's affections. A professional musician, well dressed and well spoken, he gains the family's respect and overcomes their prejudice initially by playing ragtime music on their piano. Things go well until he is humiliated by a racist fire crew, led by Will Conklin, who vandalize his Model T Ford. He begins a pursuit of redress by legal action but discovers he cannot hope to win because of the inherent prejudice of the system. Sarah is killed in an attempt to aid him, and Coalhouse uses the money he was saving for their wedding to pay for an extravagant funeral. \nHaving exhausted legal resources, Coalhouse begins killing firemen and bombing firehouses to force the city to meet his demands: that his Model T be restored to its original condition and Conklin be turned over to him for justice. Mother unofficially adopts Sarah and Coalhouse's neglected child over Father's objections, putting strain on their marriage. With a group of angry young men, all of whom refer to themselves as \"Coalhouse Walker\", Coalhouse continues his vigilante campaign and is joined by Younger Brother, who brings his knowledge of explosives. Coalhouse and his gang storm the Morgan Library, taking the priceless collection hostage and wiring the building with dynamite. Father is drawn into the  escalating conflict as a mediator, as is Booker T. Washington. Coalhouse agrees to exchange Conklin's life for safe passage for his men, who leave in his restored Model T. Coalhouse is then shot as he surrenders to the authorities.\nInterwoven with this story is a depiction of life in the tenement slums of New York city, focused on an Eastern European immigrant referred to as Tateh, who struggles to support himself and his daughter after driving her mother off for accepting money for sex with her employer. The girl's beauty attracts the attention of Evelyn Nesbit, who provides financial support. When Tateh learns Nesbit's identity, however, he takes his daughter out of the city. \nTateh is a talented artist and earns a living cutting out novelty paper silhouettes on the street. He tries working in a factory, where he experiences a successful workers' strike, but becomes disillusioned when he sees it change little about the workers' lives, although in the final chapter he still describes himself as a socialist. He starts making and selling moving picture books to a novelty toy company, becoming a pioneer of animation in the motion picture industry. Tateh becomes wealthy and styles himself \"the Baron\" in order to move more easily through high society. He meets and falls in love with Mother, who marries him after Father is killed in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania. They adopt each other's children, as well as Coalhouse's son, and move to California.\nMixed into the interwoven stories are subplots following prominent figures of the day, including those named above as well as in the Historical figures section below.\nThe novel is unusual for the irreverent way that historical figures and fictional characters are woven into the narrative, making for surprising connections and linking different events and trains of thought about fame and success, on the one hand, and poverty and racism on the other. Harry Houdini plays a prominent yet incidental part, reflecting on success and mortality. Arch-capitalist financier J. P. Morgan, pursuing his complex delusions of grandeur, is delivered a plainly spoken comeuppance from down-to-earth Henry Ford. Socialite Evelyn Nesbit becomes involved with the slum family and is aided by the anarchist agitator Emma Goldman. The black moderate politician Booker T. Washington tries to negotiate with"

How Green Was My Valley is a 1939 novel by Richard Llewellyn, narrated by Huw Morgan, the main character, about his Welsh family and the mining community in which they live. The author had claimed that he based the book on his own personal experiences but this was found to be untrue after his death; Llewellyn was English-born and spent little time in Wales, though he was of Welsh descent. Llewellyn gathered material for the novel from conversations with local mining families in Gilfach Goch.\nThe title of the novel appears in two sentences. It is first used in Chapter Thirty, after the narrator has had his first sexual experience. He sits up to \"...\u00a0look down in the valley.\" He then reflects: \"How green was my Valley that day, too, green and bright in the sun.\" The phrase is used again in the novel's last sentence: \"How green was my Valley then, and the Valley of them that have gone.\"\nIn the United States, Llewellyn won the National Book Award for favourite novel of 1940, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association.\nThe Older Morgans:\nGwilym Morgan, Huw's father: wants things done properly, with attention to manners, and a minding of one's own business\nBeth Morgan, Huw's mother: devoted to her children and husband, uneducated, struggles with her temper\nBronwen, sister-in-law: A gentle character to whom Huw goes when he is troubled or wants to learn information that the adults hold from him.

The first printing included a limited edition run of 200, numbered and signed by Richard Llewellyn. The original print run also included a glossary covering Welsh words and terms at the end of the book.\nThe author continued the story of Huw Morgan's life in three sequels:\nUp, Into the Singing Mountain (1960) \u2013 Huw emigrates to the Welsh colony in Patagonia, Argentina\nDown Where the Moon is Small (1966) \u2013 Huw's life in Argentina\nGreen, Green My Valley Now (1975) \u2013 Huw returns to Wales\nThe 1941 Hollywood film adaptation, which was highly successful, had a cast that included Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara, Anna Lee, Roddy McDowall (as Huw), Donald Crisp, and Barry Fitzgerald. None of the leading players was Welsh (though Welsh actor Rhys Williams made his screen debut in the film in a minor role). Directed by John Ford, How Green Was My Valley was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. How Green Was My Valley is available on DVD from 20th Century Fox as part of their 20th Century Fox Studio Classics collection.\nThe book has twice been adapted by the BBC for television, in 1960 and 1975. The 1960 adaptation featured Eynon Evans, Rachel Thomas and Glyn Houston. The 1975 production, scripted by Elaine Morgan, starred Stanley Baker, Si\u00e2n Phillips, and Nerys Hughes.\nThe novel was adapted as a Broadway musical, called A Time for Singing, which opened at the Broadway Theatre, New York, on 21 May 1966. The music was by John Morris; book and lyrics were by Gerald Freedman and John Morris. The production was directed by Mr. Freedman, and it starred Ivor Emmanuel, Tessie O'Shea, Shani Wallis, and Laurence Naismith.\nA stage version, adapted by Shaun McKenna was performed at the Theatre Royal"

Gateway was serialized in Galaxy prior to its hardcover publication. A short concluding chapter, cut before publication, was later published in the August 1977 issue of Galaxy.\nGateway is an asteroid hollowed out by the Heechee, a long-vanished alien race. Humans have had limited success understanding the left-behind bits of Heechee technology found there and elsewhere. The Gateway Corporation administers the asteroid on behalf of the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the New People's Asia, the Venusian Confederation, and the United States of Brazil.\nThere are nearly a thousand small, abandoned starships at Gateway. By extremely dangerous trial and error, humans have partially learned how to operate them. The controls for selecting a destination have been identified, but nobody knows where a particular setting will take the ship, how long the trip will last or even if there is enough fuel to get back. Those who choose to risk their lives cram the limited space with equipment and hopefully enough food for the trip, but sometimes it is not enough, and they have to resort first to cannibalism, and if that is not enough, to suicide. Attempts at reverse engineering to find out how the ships work have ended only in disaster, as has changing the settings in mid-flight. Most settings lead to useless or lethal places. A few, however, result in the discovery of new Heechee artifacts and habitable planets in other star systems, making the crews extremely wealthy. The vessels come in three standard sizes, which can hold a maximum of one, three, or five people. Some \"threes\" and many \"fives\" are armored. Each ship includes a lander to visit a planet or other object if one is found.\nDespite the risks, many people on impoverished, overcrowded Earth dream of going to Gateway. Robinette Stetley Broadhead is a young food shale miner who wins a lottery, giving him enough money to purchase a one-way ticket to Gateway. Once there, he is frightened of the danger and puts off going on a mission as long as he can. In the meantime, he becomes romantically involved with two different women, eventually settling on Gelle-Klara Moynlin, his co-enabler in fearful delaying. Eventually he starts running out of money, and although still terrified, he goes out on three trips. The first, with Klara and three others, is unsuccessful, and afterwards tension rises between them until he gives her a vicious beating. On the second trip, he goes by himself and inadvertently makes a discovery through unauthorized experimentation when he becomes infuriated after reaching Gateway Two, a smaller version of Gateway with only about 150 ships. He is awarded a sizable bonus because his route saves about 100 days of travel time; the windfall is partially offset by the large penalty for incapacitating his ship. On his third trip, the Gateway Corporation tries something different: sending two armored fives, one slightly behind the other, to the same destination, one rejected by most ships' computers; each crewmember is promised a million dollar bonus. Bob signs up in desperation, along with Klara, with whom he has reconciled.\nWhen the ships arrive, their crews find to their horror that they are in the gravitational grip of a black hole without enough power to break free. One person devises a desperate escape plan: Move everyone into one ship and thrust the other toward the black hole with an explosion in a lander, thus gaining enough of a boost to escape. They work frantically to transfer unnecessary equipment to make room for everyone in one ship, but Broadhead finds himself alone in the wrong ship when time runs out. He closes the hatch so that the plan can proceed. However, his ship is the one that breaks free.\nBroadhead returns to Gateway and is awarded all the mission bonuses. He feels such enormous survivor guilt for dooming his crewmates, especially Klara, that he suppresses his memories of what happened. However, he is very disturbed and miserable, though he does not understand why, so back on Earth as a wealthy man, he seeks therapy from an artificial intelligence Freudian therapist program which he names Sigfrid von Shrink.\nThe narrative alternates in time between Broadhead's experiences on Gateway and his sessions with Sigfrid, converging on the traumatic events near the black hole and Broadhead finally remembering them so that he can begin to heal. Sigfrid helps him realize"

The novel opens with a funny scene where Ahmad, the main character and the book's narrator, is with his friend Nevine in her car by Cairo-Alexandria desert road. They are nearly caught by the police, but Nevine narrowly manages to escape.\nWe know that Ahmad is writing pornographic stories for a living, using odesk.com, and through it he's found an agent who interested in Arabic porn stories. After sending a sample, he completed a simple interview and began to work. We know that he's living alone with his aunt after the death of his grandmother and that his father has remarried after the death of his mother, and we get to know two of his best friends\u2014El Loul, a failed TV director who is now trying to promote his scriptwriting as well as managing C-rated belly-dancers for cheap satellite channels \u2013 Abdullah, a drug addict, and his childhood best friend, who came from a wealthier family and has doesn't-give-a shit type of attitude.\nThrough tracking the two characters and their connection to Ahmad we can glimpse the 1990s middle-class generation in Cairo as well as the strange relationship Ahmad and Abdullah had when they were teenagers, and, echoing that, the porn industry and stars.\nNevine herself is such a character: She's a perfect nymphomaniac who married a guy she despises after returning with her family from the Persian Gulf region, where she spent her childhood. While the hubby, who married her for her family's money, is off in the Gulf, she has her revenge by shagging as many men as she can, only two or three times before hitting on a new man. Through this, she got to know Ahmad and she dumped him as usual before getting to know Ali Luza.\nAli Luza, a \"Robin Hood targeting the Sluts\", as Ahmad describes him in one point in the novel, escorts them for a while and pays for them, but after his boredom with the liaison, he just mugs them, getting his money back with extra. Ali is a son of a working-class \"shaabi\" restaurant owner but never lacks for self-esteem. He has a brother, Hamousa, addicted to recreational drugs, and he's serving as a local thug. Nevine got mugged by Luza as expected, and from what she said very briefly to Ahmad, she was also gang-raped before he took all of her money, credit cards, with codes, and made her sign a contract selling her expensive car. As Ahmad realizes, the contract will only be used to get more money out of her to get the car back.\nNevine wants to beat Ali up for what he did, and she seeks Ahmad's help. He takes her to see El Loul in one of his favorite night-clubs, and while Tslam Al Ayadi is playing with a C-rated belly-dancer, Ahmad was telling El loul his idea: He will keep Nevine in his place while sending a belly dancer El Loul knows to seduce Ali, who will go to El Loul's place. There, they would kidnap him till getting Nevine's stuff back. Abdullah agreed to join the scheme for the good money Nevine offered, and so did El Loul.\nIndeed, they sent a belly dancer to Ali Louza's father restaurant, which was where he first picked up Nevine and where he used to stay. There, Ali fights with locals and gains the belly dancer's admiration, which makes her screw up the whole thing when Ali falls for her friend.\nIt's a fiasco, and facing this truth Ahmad improvises an even crazier scheme: They, he and Abdullah, will wait in the spot Ali Louza will come to pick up the money and give back the car, in some alley near downtown. There, they'll attack him, put him in the car, and drive to one of Abdullah's friends homes in Al Rehab (a city in between Cairo and Suez).\nEventually, they went there, wearing two pairs of women's stockings over their heads so as not to be discovered (such a lousy old-fashioned way to masquerade, in tribute to old Egyptian action movies especially Adel Emam's \"Al Mashbooh\"), and they attacked Ali and Hamousa, who was taken aback. But suddenly another thing happened: The local gang Ali Louza had previously fought ambushed him at the same time, bullets were whizzing around, and Ahmad found himself in front of the bag of money Nevine brought for Ali. He just picked it up without thinking, leaving both Abdullah (who had probably been hit by then) and Nevine, who had fled with the car after the windows had been shot out.\nAhmad ran to a wide street, discovering that he had failed to remove the stocking from his head, and faced a patrol and many people looking at him in shock. He continued to run, both police and people chased him.\nIn his article about the novel, Egyptian poet Rami Yehia compared the lead paragraph of the"

Darrow of Lykos and his legions are barricaded from all sides on Mercury from the forces of the Ash Lord's daughter Atalantia and Atlas au Raa, the Fear Knight. Lysander au Lune and the Raa family meet Atalantia aboard her vessel the Annihilo to broker an alliance between The Rim and The Core to defeat Darrow and give rise to a new Society. Lysander and his former friend Ajax au Grimmus participate in an Iron Rain and slaughter Darrow's armies, but Darrow fights back with a Storm God: an ancient weapon hidden by Octavia au Lune that can create and control massive earthquakes. In the chaos, Lysander loses an eye and his companion Seraphina au Raa is killed; Ajax betrays Lysander and leaves him to die in vengeance for Lysander's favorable position with the family as a child. Darrow kills his pilot Orion, who has gone out of control and uses the Storm God to annihilate the planet. Darrow's forces narrowly manage to win the battle by seizing control of Mercury's center of commerce Heliopolis with the arrival of the Morning Star.\nVirginia au Augustus struggles to keep her power as the Sovereign with her allies growing increasingly hostile due to her continued support for Darrow's agenda. She suspects treachery from her allies in the Forum, especially Publius cu Caraval. Having managed to locate Sevro au Barca, Virginia kidnaps the Duke of Hands and attempts to pry information on The Syndicate's Queen and the location of their missing children. The Duke of Hands is subsequently mind-wiped. On the day where Virginia is to give a speech to the Solar Republic giving one last plea of help to free Darrow, Sevro tracks down The Syndicate Queen on Earth. Virginia is betrayed when her closest allies are all poisoned and a mob kills her friend Daxo au Telemanus before kidnapping her. The Syndicate Queen arrives and is revealed to be Lilath au Faran, who has gave birth to a clone of Virginia's deceased brother Adrius au Augustus, better known as The Jackal. Virigina manages to sow confusion in the 10-year-old Adrius {nicknamed \"the Abomination\") and escapes, but is forced to leave Sevro and several Howlers behind with Lilath.\nEphraim ti Horn, Pax au Augustus, and Electra au Barca are kidnapped by the Obsidians led by Sefi Volarus. Sefi hopes to lead the Obsidians into a new age and secure their freedom across the galaxy. They start by taking over several areas of Mars including Cimmeria. Sefi reveals to Ephraim that Volga, his former apprentice, is the last surviving daughter of Ragnar Volarus and is the heir to the Obsidian throne. Ephraim, feeling he has been reformed from his ways as a thief, refuses to help Sefi.

Ten years after their victory over the Golds of the Core Worlds, a new Solar Republic has replaced the tyrannical Society. Darrow of Lykos serves as ArchImperator of the Republic's forces, which are still at war with the Ash Lord, Magnus au Grimmus, and his allies. Darrow's wife Virginia au Augustus governs as the elected Sovereign, but a faction called Vox Populi, led by Dancer, has risen to power in the Senate. Ignoring the Senate's orders, Darrow launches a massive assault on Mercury, wresting the planet from the Ash Lord but with great casualties. When the Senate learns from Darrow's enemy, Julia au Bellona, that he rejected an overture of peace from the Ash Lord, they issue a warrant for Darrow's arrest. Darrow, knowing that the potential truce is a ploy by the Ash Lord that will never come to fruition, escapes with his closest allies on a dangerous mission to assassinate Magnus. Darrow and the Howlers set off to Earth, where they free Apollonius au Valii-Rath and set off to Venus to kill the Ash Lord. They invade his fortress, but find him bedridden. He reveals that his daughter Atalantia is heading to retake Mercury, which is not fully protected.\nMeanwhile, Cassius au Bellona and his ward Lysander au Lune become embroiled in the political upheaval happening in the Outer Rim, as Dido au Raa deposes her husband, Romulus, the Sovereign of the Rim Dominion. Cassius is challenged by multiple Golds for his past \"crimes\" against the Raa; he kills one after the other but is gravely wounded, and ultimately dies. Dido shows the Moon Lords evidence that their Ganymede shipyards were destroyed by Darrow and not by the former Sovereign Octavia au Lune as they had been led to believe. They decide to go to war against the Republic, and Lysander joins them.\nLyria is a Red who lives in Camp 121 on Mars after her people are freed from the mines. The terrorist organization known as the Red Hand attacks the camp, killing nearly everyone, and Lyria and her nephew Liam are the only members of her family to survive. Republic forces eventually arrive to intervene, and Lyria saves Kavax au Telemanus from drowning. He takes her into his household. On Luna, Lyria befriends a veteran named Philippe, who is actually the criminal Ephraim ti Horn in disguise. He uses her in his plan to bring down a Telemanus transport ship and kidnap Pax, the son of Darrow and Virginia, and Electra, the daughter of Sevro and Victra, at the request of the crime lord known as the Duke of Hands. Caught after the fact, Ephraim agrees to help his former sister-in-law, Darrow's deputy Holiday ti Nakamura, retrieve the children.

In the chaos, Lysander loses an eye and his companion Seraphina au Raa is killed; Ajax betrays Lysander and leaves him to die in vengeance for Lysander's favorable position with the family as a child.

Lankar of Callisto is a science fantasy  novel by American writer Lin Carter, the sixth in his Callisto series. It was first published in paperback by Dell Books in June 1975. It is noted for the author writing himself into the story.\nDen Valdron, assessing the series in ERBzine, calls the book \"an odd novel, more travelogue than adventure, and Carter's constant references to other works of fiction are a bit annoying ... [and suggest] a painful lack of imagination.\" He finds the plot and action thin, and the author an inadequate action hero, nothing that \"the 'dog' that adopts him does practically all the work.\" His ultimate judgment is that \"Lankar of Callisto is frankly embarrassing to read, what with its endless references to others' works, the obvious self consciousness and 'tweeness' of the author, and the fact that just about everything interesting happens offstage and to other people.  It's an interesting conceit, but sadly it fails.\"\nLankar of Callisto title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\nValdron, Den. \"Lin Carter's Callisto Series (Part 1 of a series of 12)\" in ERBzine 1731.\nFantastic Fiction entry\nLankar of Callisto title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database"

In September 1987, Dr. Julian Whittlesey is leading an expedition through the Amazon Basin, in the Brazilian rainforest, in search of the lost Kothoga tribe. He hopes to prove that they still do exist and in the process learn more about their culture, including their lizard god Mbwun (\"He Who Walks On All Fours\"), supposedly the son of Satan. However, Whittlesey disappears after finding the mutilated body of his partner, Crocker, and realizes that a creature in the bush is stalking him. A year later, in Belem, a dock worker named Ven is suddenly and brutally killed when a freighter arrives with a shipment of crates from Whittlesey's expedition.\nSeven years later, in a fictionalized version of New York City's American Museum of Natural History, two young boys are found dead in a museum stairwell, having gotten lost in the late hours of the museum. NYPD Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta leads the subsequent investigation. He has the museum under tight lockdown and its staff placed under curfew, for fear the murderer is still hiding somewhere in the museum or the many catacombs that run underneath it. The three prominent leaders of the museum - curator Winston Wright, deputy head Ian Cuthbert, and public relations director Lavinia Rickman - all try to keep the murders under wraps, as the grand gala opening of the new \"Superstition\" exhibition, led by George Moriarty, draws nearer, an event that will feature many wealthy benefactors as well as Mayor Harper. Rickman even hires The New York Times reporter Bill Smithback, Jr. to cover the murder investigation but repeatedly edits his reports so they will appear more favorable towards the museum and its leadership. Assistant Curator Gregory Kawakita jokingly begins spreading the rumor of the \"Museum Beast\", a legendary monster that has allegedly been roaming the tunnels under the museum for years and is responsible for the murders. Although the rumors are initially dismissed as myth, D'Agosta is shocked during the autopsy to discover a claw buried in one of the boy's brains.\nWhen a security guard suffers a similarly brutal death, FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast arrives to aid in the investigation, having taken a personal interest in the unique nature of the kills. The investigation intensifies as the gala draws nearer, with the search spreading to the tunnels under the museum. Margo Green and her mentor, Dr. Whitney Frock, initially take little to no interest in the investigation, but Pendergast eventually approaches them when he realizes the claw from the autopsy matches the claws on a Mbwun figurine that had been sent back to the museum in a crate in 1987 and is set to be put on display in the new exhibition. Green, with Smithback's help, manages to get into the secure vault and gain access to some letters that Whittlesey had sent to a museum colleague named H.C. Montague, detailing the struggles the 1987 expedition had been going through. Pendergast then reveals the primary reason for his interest in the case: the nature of the murders of the two boys and the security guard matches the murder of the Brazilian dock worker in 1988, as well as several other dock workers in Louisiana later that year. Pendergast was able to trace back to the one connection among the museum murders, the Louisiana murder, and the Belem murder: the shipment of crates Whittlesey had sent the museum in 1987. However, other than one smaller crate containing the Mbwun figurine, the crates were empty, save massive quantities of local plant leaves apparently used as packaging. Frock reveals that those crates have been moved into the heavily reinforced secure vault as well, and after Green and Smithback's stunt to get the letters, the directors are well aware of their intentions and will never allow them access to the crates. Pendergast hints at the possibility that the murders might not have been committed by a human, and that the Mbwun monster may somehow have been sent to the museum by Whittlesey's shipment.\nReading through more of Whittlesey's letters, Green and Smithback discover one other major colleague of Whittlesey's who is still working at the museum, and to whom one of the letters was addressed, Dr. Jorgensen. They ask Jorgensen about the nature of the expedition and its aftermath. Jorgensen explains that Whittlesey was determined to prove that the Kothoga tribe had not gone extinct, and that he had found it at long last on a tepui deep in the Brazilian jungle. In addition, Whittlesey had apparently discovered a unique plant at the base of the tepui that had some kind of protein-like quality to it. However, Whittlesey was being accompanied by a museum"

Agent Pendergast visits Medicine Creek, Kansas after a gruesome murder occurs.  With the help of local teenaged misfit Corrie Swanson, he continues to investigate as more citizens are killed. Pendergast is soon led to believe that the murderer must be a member of the community. He soon discovers that the murders are connected to an old curse.\nA mutilated corpse is found in a cornfield in Medicine Creek, Kansas, drawing Agent Pendergast there.  Since he is technically on vacation, he has no official status or resources, and is barely tolerated by the local Sheriff, Hazen.\nThe victim, a petty con artist and relic hunter named Sheila Swegg, was found naked in a clearing, with her neck broken.  A grisly tableau around the body, consisting of crows impaled on arrows, indicates the work of a serial killer.  Pendergast surprises the police when he notices that the arrows are genuine 19th century Cheyenne artifacts, and moreover are almost impossibly well-preserved.\nPendergast shares some of these details with the editor of the town newspaper, in exchange for an overview of the town and its population.  Based on his information, the editor produces a somewhat sensationalist news story, associating the murder with a local town legend, \"The Curse of the Forty-Fives.\"\nBut Pendergast upsets both the Sheriff and the editor with his opinion that the killer is local to Medicine Creek, for the simple reason that the town is so isolated that no one could have entered the area from outside without being seen.\nFinding it inconvenient to conduct his investigations on foot, Pendergast hires a local teenager, Corrie Swanson, to chauffeur him around in her battered AMC Gremlin.  Corrie, a Goth who lives alone with her alcoholic mother, is the town misfit, who has frequently been arrested for loitering.  Though she is suspicious of Pendergast, she eagerly accepts his offer of $100 a day, just for her driving skills and the benefit of her familiarity with the town.\nBefore long, additional murders are committed, also in the corn field.  Following Pendergast around, Corrie is surprised to find herself drawn into the investigation.  For all their differences, Pendergast is the first person to value Corrie's abilities and entrust her with responsibility, and she unexpectedly thrives on the experience.  As he explains it, her assistance is invaluable to him, since she is intimately familiar with the townspeople and their secrets, and yet, as an outsider, has no problem telling him the unvarnished truth.\nThe other victims found in the cornfield are likewise arranged in bizarre tableaus, but markedly different from the first one.  While going over the ground, Pendergast gives Corrie a brief lecture on the classification of serial murder, and the difference between \"organized\" and \"disorganized\" killers.  What is intriguing is that Medicine Creek's killer does not fall readily into either category: some of his attacks are unplanned and seemingly random, while his \"organized\" killings vary widely in their ritual aspects.\nCorrie takes Pendergast to meet \"Brushy Jim,\" a semi-deranged Vietnam veteran who is an avid collector of Old West memorabilia, and the town authority on \"The Curse of the Forty-Fives.\"  Pleased to have an interested audience, Jim tells the story: the Forty-Fives were a group of Confederate Army veterans who formed a guerilla band after the Civil War to hunt Native Americans in the Kansas territory and make it \"safe\" for the white settlers.  The Forty-Fives were both cowardly and brutal, and their modus operandi was to attack unprotected villages and slaughter the women and children.  One night, a group of Cheyenne warriors managed to ambush the Forty-Fives, appearing behind their sentries and disappearing like ghosts, after killing all of them.  The Forty-Fives' leader, horribly mutilated, pronounced a curse on the land shortly before he died.\nWhen a visiting scientist is found murdered, the Sheriff develops his own theory of the case: Medicine Creek and a neighboring town, both of which are dying economically, were competing for a contract from Kansas State University, to plant an experimental field of genetically-engineered corn for ethanol production.  The \"serial killings\" must be a sham by the administration of the other town, to scare the scientist and the university away from Medicine Creek.\nThe Sheriff becomes so enamored of his theory that he appeals to Pendergast's regional F.B.I. superior, to have him removed from the case.

Midnight is a fantasy novel, the first book in Erin Hunter's Warriors: The New Prophecy series. Following The Darkest Hour and Firestar's Quest, and preceding Moonrise, it was released 10 May 2005. The novel centers on a group of feral cats living in four Clans: ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan, and ShadowClan.\nMidnight was first released in the US and Canada in hardcover on 10 May 2005. It was released in the UK on 25 October 2006. It was released in paperback on 4 April 2006. It was also released for the Amazon Kindle on November 6, 2007.\nThe reception of Midnight was mixed. Children's Literature gave a negative review. Points raised in the review include the demotion of Firestar to a simple spokesman, the huge volume of characters, and the \"wimpy\" group of traveling cats. However, the review did praise the character of Squirrelpaw.\nOn the other hand, Kirkus Reviews said the novel was \"structurally solid\". BookLoons called the new generation \"engaging\".\nThe forest depicted in the book is based on New Forest, a forest in southern England. The herbs that the cats use for healing is based on information found in Culpeper's Herbal by Nicholas Culpeper.\nMidnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1) (Hardcover).

It includes aspects of suspense, science fiction, love story, and horror.\nAs with many Koontz books, Midnight is divided into parts.  Part One: Along the Night Coast, contains chapters one through\nfifty-seven.  Part Two: Daybreak in Hades, contains thirty-seven chapters, but is similar to Part One in that it begins with its own 'Chapter One'.  Part Three: The Night Belongs To Them, follows suit, begins with its own Chapter One, and has forty-one chapters. \nMidnight was Dean Koontz's first No. 1 hardcover on the New York Times bestseller list.\nMidnight includes a mixture of two classic plots- the great 50's film Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the classic H.G. Wells tale, The Island of Dr. Moreau.  And, indeed, Koontz mentions both of these later in the novel.\nSam Booker: a forty-two year old FBI agent, who has lost his wife and is now a single parent to a teenager, Scott.\nTessa Jane Lockland: a thirty-three year old documentary film maker and the sister of Janice Capshaw, an early victim of Shaddack's regressive citizens.\nChrissie Foster: an 11-year-old girl who escapes from her parents after they try to convert her to one of Shaddack's regressive citizens.\nLoman Watkins: Chief of Police for Moonlight Cove.  A good police officer who cares about the well-being of his community.  He is one of the first people converted by Shaddack, but he is converted without his consent.\nThomas Shaddack: the primary antagonist.  He is a sociopath with no remorse.  He has no ability to understand, or care about, the lives of others.  He became a murderer at a very young age when he killed both of his parents.  He sees his purpose in life as nothing less than the complete subjugation of the human race which would enable him to do anything and everything that his twisted mind desires.\nHarry Talbot: a disabled Viet Nam veteran who observes the changes in the town through his telescope and alerts the FBI to the problems.\nMoose: Harry Talbot's intelligent service dog.\nJanice Capshaw: a late night exercise enthusiast and the widow of a Lutheran minister.  She is an early victim of Shaddack's regressive citizens.

The day that Georges (with a silent s, named for Georges Seurat) moves from a house to an apartment with his family, he sees a boy walking two dogs, disappearing into a locked door under the lobby stairs. Georges's family have moved because his father, an architect, was laid off from his job, which gives him an opportunity to start his own business. As they are unpacking and throwing away extra material in the basement, Georges sees a hand-lettered sign advertising \"Spy Club Meeting\u2014TODAY!\" When he returns to the basement later to attend the meeting, he first meets Candy and then her older brother Safer, who is the mysterious twelve-year-old boy who was walking the dogs earlier. Safer suspects one of the residents of their building, who Safer has dubbed Mr. X, \"is almost definitely up to something evil\" because he only dresses in black and is always moving suitcases in and out of the apartment building. The novel details Safer's efforts to unmask the shadowy Mr. X while Georges continues to struggle with bullying.\nThe bullying that Georges faces is similar to Stead's experience when she started middle school. \"I feel like there are stages in many, many people\u2019s childhoods when you don\u2019t have one good friend like [I had]. It can happen a lot in sixth and seventh grade because that\u2019s when things are changing so quickly. It\u2019s like a desperate dash for some kind of acceptable identity, and it can get ugly.\" The novel is dedicated to Stead's close friend from middle school.\nThe in-class science experiment described in the novel is the so-called \"supertaster\" experiment, which determines the subject's genetically-linked sensitivity to phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). Stead recalls that she was not sensitive to the taste, and that since the only other student in her class that was not sensitive was also a boy she had a crush on, she used the myth that said the test determines soul mates in Liar & Spy.\nSafer puts Georges through a spy apprenticeship that was inspired by the plot of Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth by E.L.

Todd Hewitt is the only boy left in Prentisstown, a small settlement on New World \u2013 an alien planet only recently colonized by humanity. Todd is within days of his thirteenth birthday, the age in Prentisstown at which all boys become men.\nTodd has been told that all the women and nearly all the men on New World were killed in a war with the Spackle that occurred around the time of his birth. The Spackle are New World's native inhabitants and are blamed for the release of a germ that caused the majority of deaths and was particularly fatal to women. The inhabitants of Prentisstown claim that every Spackle was wiped out during the war, and Todd has no reason to believe otherwise. As a side effect of the virus, the remaining men in Prentisstown can hear each others' (and animals') thoughts, described as an ever-present cascade of what they call Noise.\nThe men of Prentisstown make up the last surviving settlement on New World \u2013 at least according to Mayor Prentiss, after whom the town is named.\nAt the beginning of the book, Todd and his dog, Manchee, discover a lone patch of silence, described as a \"hole in the Noise\", in a local swamp. When Todd explains the silence to his adoptive parents, Ben and Cillian, his Noise accidentally projects the discovery to the entire town. Ben and Cillian suddenly reveal they have been planning Todd's escape from Prentisstown for his entire life. The two men immediately force him to leave Prentisstown with just a satchel of supplies and Manchee to accompany him. Todd unwillingly obeys. Cillian fights off the Mayor's son, Davy Prentiss, and other men from the town while Ben gives Todd his own hunting knife and Todd's deceased mother's diary.\nTodd escapes into the swamp with Manchee and discovers a girl who lacks Noise. She is the first girl Todd has ever seen, except in videos and photographs. The girl says nothing at all.\nTodd, Manchee, and the girl are suddenly attacked by the town preacher, Aaron, who has recently been provoking Todd in physical and mental fights. Todd and Manchee force him into the swamp's lake, where he is attacked by crocodiles. The girl silently leads Todd through the swamp to her scout ship, where her parents' bodies lie dead. She has crash-landed on New World, Todd realises. With aid from a map inside Todd's mother's diary, the three begin traveling together towards Farbranch, a settlement marked on the map. Todd hopes that the settlement still exists and that, if so, it can protect them from Prentisstown.\nTodd realises that he, infected with the germ, might transmit the germ to the girl and kill her. She hears this in his Noise and flees, but he pursues her, along with Manchee, until they both encounter Aaron and Prentisstown men who are tracking them at a bridge. The girl manages to save the three by soaking part of the bridge in lighter fluid and setting it on fire with her campfire pack. After this incident, she works up the courage to speak and finally tells Todd her name: Viola.\nTodd and Viola are found by a woman from Farbranch named Hildy. She tells Todd that the Noise germ is, in fact, not fatal for women and does not affect them at all \u2013 none of the women have Noise. She takes the three to her settlement. At nightfall, an army of men from Prentisstown arrives and burns down the town, killing all those who will not join them. Todd, Viola, and Manchee escape and flee for Haven, where it is rumoured there may be a cure for Noise. They also hope to find a transmitter tower to contact Viola's people, who are a second wave of planetary settlers, to warn them.\nAfter a few days on the road, they are found by Davy. Viola manages to shock Davy. Todd moves to kill him but finds himself unable to follow through. Instead, Todd ties Davy up before heading off for Haven with Viola. During the trip, Todd, Viola, and Manchee find a live Spackle. Todd is shocked, having believed that all Spackle had been killed in the war. Worried at an attack and frustrated with what his feels is cowardice for keeping Davy alive, Todd leaps at the Spackle. He kills it but faces instant regret.\nAaron finds them, stabs Todd, and kidnaps Viola. Todd wakes and hurriedly pursues Aaron, but as his stab wound becomes infected, he quickly weakens. Todd finds Viola and Aaron and, using Manchee as a distraction, he manages to rescue Viola. When the plan is unsuccessful, Todd and Viola manage to get away but are compelled to leave Manchee behind with Aaron, who kills the dog in a fit of rage. The pair flee on a boat, and Todd passes out from his wounds.\nTodd wakes up under a care of a doctor in another"

It was released on October 19, 2010 in the USA and on 28 October 2010 in the United Kingdom.\nA preview of the book's first chapter is currently available in PDF form from the author's website\nThomas Covenant is resurrected by Linden Avery. He is once again a leper, and his mind slips in and out of human reality as an after-effect of spending millennia as part of the Arch of Time. As a result of the combined use of wild magic, Earthpower, and Loric's krill, the Worm of the World's End has been awakened, and is moving towards the Land to drink of the Earthblood. This will result in the destruction of all things, the breaking of the Arch of Time which encompasses the Earth, and subsequently the release of Lord Foul. The Elohim are fleeing to the farthest reaches of the Earth to avoid being eaten by the Worm.\nMajor enemies to Linden and Thomas include Lord Foul, the Worm, Kastenessen, Roger Covenant, Joan Covenant (possessed by a Raver), She Who Must Not Be Named, and other creatures loosed upon the land. Linden Avery, accompanied by Ramen, Giants, and Haruchai, seeks to find a way to stop Joan's caesures, find and free her son Jeremiah, and stop the Worm of the World's End.\nThomas Covenant\nLinden Avery\nJeremiah (Adopted son of Linden Avery)\nRoger Covenant (Son of Thomas Covenant)\nJoan (Former wife of Thomas Covenant; Mother of Roger)\nAnele (Son of Sunder and Hollian)\nStave (A Haruchai; a Master of the Land)\nLiand (Stonedowner)\nEsmer (Son of Cail and the merewives)\nMahrtiir (Manethrall of the Ramen)\nBhapa (Cord of the Ramen)\nPahni (Cord of the Ramen)\nBranl (Humbled of the Masters)\nGalt (Humbled of the Masters; son of Stave)\nClyme (Humbled of the Masters)\nthe Harrow (Insequent)\nthe Ardent (Insequent)\nRime Coldspray (Ironfist of the Swordmainnir of the Giants)\nShe Who Must Not Be Named (Bane)\nHyn (Ranyhyn)\nHynyn (Ranyhyn)\nInfelice (Elohim)\nStephen R.

Wheelers is a hard science fiction novel written by English mathematician Ian Stewart and reproductive biologist Jack Cohen. The book was originally released in hardcover form in the year 2000, and a more common paperback printing was begun in 2001. It has enjoyed modest commercial success and is perhaps best known for its conceptions of alien zoology and intelligence\u2014hallmarks of Cohen's work as a consultant on exobiology for books, movies, and television.\nThough this is the first time the pair has written a fictional narrative of their own, both Stewart and Cohen have worked continually with friend and fantasy author Terry Pratchett on his best-selling Discworld series.\nThe book pits the earth and its inhabitants against a universe of diplomatic but equally narcissistic alien lifeforms.\nEarth in the novel is divided into two enormous political conglomerates\u2014those of Ecotopia and Free China. These are demarcated by the contemporary political, economic, and cultural divisions between the Western and Eastern Worlds.\nFree China shares similarities with today's People's Republic; for instance, there is an emphasis on traditional Chinese culture and medicine (the trade in poached animals for the purposes of concocting elixirs and potions from their bones is an important plot point in the novel). Further parallels to modern China include purposeful isolationism and two-way information control.\nThe blimps are for the most part egalitarian on an individual basis, but their governance is handled at the topmost levels by an oligarchical group of Elders who are constantly mired in mindlessly bureaucratic detail that makes any decision a lengthy process. They are aided by administratively minded symbiauts which take the roles of secretaries and stenographers, reinforcing the council members' natural memory for bylaws and precedents.\nBlimp culture has been irrevocably shaped by the tragic loss of Firsthome, and the society at large has come to value personal safety over individualism or cosmic equanimity.\nThe Instrumentality is a rebellious faction which is ostensibly concerned with the possibility that redirected comets might impact intelligent life on other planets\u2014even Poisonblue, as they call the Earth. Despite this seeming goodwill, the blimp Halfholder comes to understand through the course of the novel that they are as much concerned with political gain as moral fortitude.\nSkydiving, or free-falling from one floating blimp city in the attempt to land on another, is an illegal activity used by rebellious groups or individuals to demonstrate against the current order. This wanton disregard for personal safety flies in the face of established protocol and is therefore considered punishable in the extreme.\nWheelers, which begins in the year 2210, is set over a backdrop of future technologies which play a role\u2014though not an especially defining one\u2014in the story.\nDue to The Pause (a period of time in which fears over unreliable A.I. all but halted forward progress), there is a mix of far-flung futurism and relatively mundane tech.\nThe Internet has been replaced by the Xnet, commonly referred to as 'the X.' Much like the 'net today, it facilitates communication, information exchange, hacking, and even personal navigation (courtesy of a GPS-like orbital tracking system).\nAll citizens of Ecotopia wear wristnodes (often shortened to 'nodes) which allow personal communication and access to the Xnet, presumably through some intuitive holographic display.\nTelevision has been replaced by vidivid technology, or VV for short. Details are scarce, but the implication is that it, like a wristnode display, is holographic.\nCars and trucks are the average means of travel for the citizens of Ectopia and Free China, but government agencies and elite clandestine operations may own helicopters.\nSpaceships are available, but remain expensive luxuries. Prudence Odingo owes hers, the Tiglath-Pileser, to services rendered for the Order of the Cuckoo. There is no interstellar travel in human hands, though late in the novel a system of slingshot rocks are used to propel Moses' travel to speeds far beyond those attainable by conventional engines.\nThe Order itself owns a giant hollowed-out asteroid which has been made to recreate the majesty of Tibet (the original home of The Order, now under the power of Free China\u2014much like today). Like the giant alien ship of Arthur C. Clarke's 1973 novel Rendezvous with Rama, the New Tibet Habitat contains an artificial world complete with sacred mountains like Chumulangma and achieves normal gravity via centripetal force.\nThe Order of the Cuckoo, who continued advancing during The Pause and who make"

Wheelers is a hard science fiction novel written by English mathematician Ian Stewart and reproductive biologist Jack Cohen. The book was originally released in hardcover form in the year 2000, and a more common paperback printing was begun in 2001. It has enjoyed modest commercial success and is perhaps best known for its conceptions of alien zoology and intelligence\u2014hallmarks of Cohen's work as a consultant on exobiology for books, movies, and television.\nThough this is the first time the pair has written a fictional narrative of their own, both Stewart and Cohen have worked continually with friend and fantasy author Terry Pratchett on his best-selling Discworld series.\nThe book pits the earth and its inhabitants against a universe of diplomatic but equally narcissistic alien lifeforms.\nEarth in the novel is divided into two enormous political conglomerates\u2014those of Ecotopia and Free China. These are demarcated by the contemporary political, economic, and cultural divisions between the Western and Eastern Worlds.\nFree China shares similarities with today's People's Republic; for instance, there is an emphasis on traditional Chinese culture and medicine (the trade in poached animals for the purposes of concocting elixirs and potions from their bones is an important plot point in the novel). Further parallels to modern China include purposeful isolationism and two-way information control.\nThe blimps are for the most part egalitarian on an individual basis, but their governance is handled at the topmost levels by an oligarchical group of Elders who are constantly mired in mindlessly bureaucratic detail that makes any decision a lengthy process. They are aided by administratively minded symbiauts which take the roles of secretaries and stenographers, reinforcing the council members' natural memory for bylaws and precedents.\nBlimp culture has been irrevocably shaped by the tragic loss of Firsthome, and the society at large has come to value personal safety over individualism or cosmic equanimity.\nThe Instrumentality is a rebellious faction which is ostensibly concerned with the possibility that redirected comets might impact intelligent life on other planets\u2014even Poisonblue, as they call the Earth. Despite this seeming goodwill, the blimp Halfholder comes to understand through the course of the novel that they are as much concerned with political gain as moral fortitude.\nSkydiving, or free-falling from one floating blimp city in the attempt to land on another, is an illegal activity used by rebellious groups or individuals to demonstrate against the current order. This wanton disregard for personal safety flies in the face of established protocol and is therefore considered punishable in the extreme.\nWheelers, which begins in the year 2210, is set over a backdrop of future technologies which play a role\u2014though not an especially defining one\u2014in the story.\nDue to The Pause (a period of time in which fears over unreliable A.I. all but halted forward progress), there is a mix of far-flung futurism and relatively mundane tech.\nThe Internet has been replaced by the Xnet, commonly referred to as 'the X.' Much like the 'net today, it facilitates communication, information exchange, hacking, and even personal navigation (courtesy of a GPS-like orbital tracking system).\nAll citizens of Ecotopia wear wristnodes (often shortened to 'nodes) which allow personal communication and access to the Xnet, presumably through some intuitive holographic display.\nTelevision has been replaced by vidivid technology, or VV for short. Details are scarce, but the implication is that it, like a wristnode display, is holographic.\nCars and trucks are the average means of travel for the citizens of Ectopia and Free China, but government agencies and elite clandestine operations may own helicopters.\nSpaceships are available, but remain expensive luxuries. Prudence Odingo owes hers, the Tiglath-Pileser, to services rendered for the Order of the Cuckoo. There is no interstellar travel in human hands, though late in the novel a system of slingshot rocks are used to propel Moses' travel to speeds far beyond those attainable by conventional engines.\nThe Order itself owns a giant hollowed-out asteroid which has been made to recreate the majesty of Tibet (the original home of The Order, now under the power of Free China\u2014much like today). Like the giant alien ship of Arthur C. Clarke's 1973 novel Rendezvous with Rama, the New Tibet Habitat contains an artificial world complete with sacred mountains like Chumulangma and achieves normal gravity via centripetal force.\nThe Order of the Cuckoo, who continued advancing during The Pause and who make"

When the youngest daughter objects, she is removed from the agreement. This sets off a chain of events that brings dark truths to light and explodes long-suppressed emotions, as the story eventually reveals the long-term sexual abuse of the two eldest daughters that was committed by their father.\nThe plot also focuses on Ginny's troubled marriage, her difficulties in bearing a child and her relationship with her family.\nThere are many similarities between King Lear and A Thousand Acres, including both plot details and character development. For example, some of the names of the main characters in the novel are reminiscent of their Shakespearean counterparts. Larry is Lear, Ginny is Goneril, Rose is Regan, and Caroline is Cordelia. The role of the Cooks' neighbors, Harold Clark and his sons Loren and Jess, also rework the importance of Gloucester, Edgar and Edmund in King Lear.\nThe novel maintains major themes present in Lear, namely: gender roles, appearances vs. reality, generational conflict, hierarchical structures (the Great chain of being), madness, and the powerful force of nature.\nLarry Cook = King Lear\nGinny Cook Smith = Goneril\nRose Cook Lewis = Regan\nCaroline Cook Rasmussen = Cordelia\nFrank Rasmussen = King of France\nTy Smith = Duke of Albany\nPete Lewis = Duke of Cornwall\nJess Clark = Edmund\nHarold Clark = Earl of Gloucester\nLoren Clark = Edgar\nKen La Salle = Kent\nMarv Carson (The Fool)\n\"King Lear in Zebulon County\".\n\"King Lear in a CornField\".\nJane Smiley discusses A Thousand Acres on the BBC World Book Club\nPhotos of the first edition of A Thousand Acres"

While researching another book, Julia Scheeres, the author of the memoir Jesus Land, learned that the FBI had recently released 50,000 pages of documents that agents found in Jonestown, everything from shipping manifests to notes to Jim Jones from residents pleading with him to let them go home. It took her a year to read and organize the FBI files, which she acquired under the Freedom of Information Act, and two more years to write the book.\nA Thousand Lives focuses on five people: Edith Roller, Stanley Clayton, Hyacinth Thrash and Jim and Tommy Bogue. Together they represent the varied demographics of Peoples Temple, Jim Jones' church. Roller and the Bogues are white, while Clayton and Thrash are African American. The book explores how so many people\u2014black, white, middle class, poor, educated and unschooled\u2014ended up dying in Jonestown. Using diaries and other primary sources as well as hundreds of hours of interviews, Scheeres presents a heart-breaking portrait of belief, survival and loss in this idyllic community.\nThe book was critically acclaimed and widely reviewed.  The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that it was \"Riveting... unforgettable... heart-breaking... bone-chilling. You will not be able to look away.\" The Los Angeles Times Book Review wrote, \"Scheeres convincingly portrays the members of this community as victims, not fools. It's hard to imagine how people might be so browbeaten, afraid and misled that they would bring about their own deaths\u2014but Scheeres has made that terrifying story believable and human.\"\nBest Nonfiction Book of 2012, the Northern California Independent Booksellers' Association\nSan Francisco Chronicle, list of 100 best books of 2011\nThe Boston Globe, list of best non-fiction books of 2011\nCarolyn Kellogg (October 23, 2011). \"Book review: 'A Thousand Lives: The Untold Story of Hope, Deception, and Survival at Jonestown'\".

The Confidential Agent (1939) is a thriller novel by British author Graham Greene. Fuelled by Benzedrine, Greene wrote it in six weeks. To avoid distraction, he rented a room in Bloomsbury from a landlady who lived in a flat below him. He used that apartment in the novel (it's where D. hides for a day) and had an affair with the landlady's daughter. He wrote the book for money and was so displeased with his work that he wanted it published under a pseudonym. But critics took a far different view; The New York Times, for example, called the novel \"a magnificent tour-de-force.\"\n\"D\", a patriot from a country suffering a civil war, is in England to secure a contract with coal magnate Lord Benditch that will greatly assist the faltering loyalist cause. His country is nameless and the details of its history, geography, and current politics remain vague. However, the reader could have little doubt \u2013 and Greene himself admitted as much \u2013 that the Spanish Civil War was his main inspiration for the book's depiction of a left-leaning, popular revolutionary republic. Like Spain, the country in The Confidential Agent is embroiled internally in bitter factional fights while fighting a brutal civil war and a land-owning aristocracy determined to destroy the republic to regain its centuries-old privileged position. Underscoring the Spanish connection, in the novel's final section, a ship travelling from England to the unnamed country must sail westward in the Channel and then cross the Bay of Biscay.\nD is a man of peace, a university intellectual who values truth and honour. For the sake of his mission he initially accepts insults and beatings, until a turning point occurs. After all the injustices he has suffered, back in his home country and then in England, he becomes a solitary instrument of justice.\nWithout promoting a left-wing agenda, Greene shows a distaste for the authoritarian militaristic regime of the Nationalists in Spain and, readers then would quickly have made the connection, that of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. England by contrast, though often humdrum and uninspiring, is at peace under the rule of law. Greene emphasises the horrors of modern war, in particular the physical and mental effects of bombing on civilian populations.\nJews, for Forbes is Jewish, are portrayed as different from English or Spaniards. As in Stamboul Train, Greene uses a rich and sensual older Jewish man who fails to win the young Gentile girl he wants. In the end, however, a weeping Forbes rises above his self-interest.\nLiterary resonances are explicitly and covertly included, for Greene sought to ... create something legendary out of a contemporary thriller. The Chanson de Roland is used by D and Rose as a yardstick for measuring heroic or treacherous behaviour, while Rose's r\u00f4le as a mysterious helper to the hero reprises that of princesses like Ariadne and Medea. Greene saw D and Forbes as medieval knights, equally chivalrous in their actions.\nThe novel was also the basis for the 1945 film Confidential Agent, starring Charles Boyer, Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre. In the book, the nationality of the agent is not stated; in the film, he is Spanish.\nThe Confidential Agent was adapted for the radio program Escape by Ken Crossen and broadcast on 2 April 1949, starring Berry Kroeger.\nConfidential Agent (film)\nBergonzi, A Study in Greene, p. 69\nWest, The Quest for Graham Greene, p. 87\nReid, Movie Mystery and Suspense, p. 81\nWest, op cit, p. 87, 91\nGreene: An Annotated Bibliography, p.22\nGraham Greene on The Confidential Agent\n<Greeneland http://greeneland.tripod.com/agent.htm.

It was penned by writer Martin Waddell and illustrated by Joseph Wright; although, a joke book was written by Alan Durant with illustration by Paul Tempest. The paperback stories, recommended for ages 4\u20138, rely heavily on Wright's gory yet humorous illustrations. They detail Little Dracula's spooky lifestyle which includes bowling with skulls and drinking a glass of blood before sleeping in his miniature coffin. Other morbid scenes include Mrs. Dracula emptying the brain from a severed head into a frying pan for breakfast and children playing tennis with rackets strung with cat guts. Dubbed \"too silly to be truly spooky,\" the series received praise by Publishers Weekly and School Library Journal particularly for its meticulous illustrations which were also regarded as \"not for the squeamish.\"\nWhile the majority of Little Dracula books were released during the 1980s and early 1990s, some were reissued in the US as recently October 2001.

The book tells the story of Skafloc, elven-fosterling and originally son of Orm the Strong. The story begins with the marriage of Orm the Strong and Aelfrida of the English. Orm kills a witch's family on the land and later half-converts to Christianity, but quarrels with the local priest and sends him off the land. Meanwhile, an elf named Imric, with the help of the witch, seeks to capture the newly born son of Orm. In his place, Imric leaves a changeling called Valgard. The real son of Orm is taken away to elven lands and named Skafloc by the elves who raise him. As the story continues, both Skafloc and Valgard have significant roles in the war between the trolls and the elves.\nAnthony Boucher praised the original edition as \"a magnificent saga of the interplay of gods, demigods, faerie, heroes and men.\" Groff Conklin described the novel as \"a rip-snorting, bloody, imitation-Norse epic containing all the elements of faerie\". E. F. Bleiler, commenting on the 1971 revised edition, declared that \"The first portion of this novel is perhaps the finest American heroic fantasy, with good characterizations, excellent surface detail, good plotting, and an admirable recreation of the mood of the Old Norse literature. But the story ends in a mad scramble and unconvincing slaughter\".\nBritish fantasy writer Michael Moorcock has written that The Broken Sword greatly influenced his stories; Moorcock's Elric of Melnibon\u00e9 series features a magic sword, Stormbringer, which has many similarities to Skafloc's sword. Moorcock further declared The Broken Sword superior to Tolkien, calling it \"a fast-paced doom-drenched tragedy in which human heroism, love and ambition, manipulated by amoral gods, elves and trolls, led inevitably to tragic consequences.\" Despite his admiration of the original 1954 edition, Moorcock criticized the revised 1971 text, stating that the revised edition \"weakened\" the novel.\nThe original 1954 text is known for its unique prose styling which makes liberal use of archaic words, spellings and phrasings. Examples include spelling \"fairy\" as \"faerie\", the word \"glaive\" in place of \"sword\", and archaic phrasing such as the word \"will\" in place of \"want\". The 1971 revised text frequently replaces and at times altogether removes some of these stylings. Author Poul Anderson explained these alterations in the introduction to the 1971 edition, referring to his younger self in the third person: \nA generation lies between us. I would not myself write anything so headlong, so prolix, and so unrelievedly savage. This young, in many ways naive lad who bore my name could, all unwittingly, give readers a wrong impression of my work and me. At the same time, I don\u2019t feel free to tamper with what he has done.\nA partial adaptation of the novel, done as a serialized black-and-white graphic novel, was adapted by fantasy writer Tom Reamy and illustrated by professional fantasy artist George Barr. This was published during the mid-to-late 1960s over several issues of Reamy's twice Hugo Award-nominated science fiction fanzine Trumpet; the adaptation was never completed, though there were revived plans underway to do so at the time of Reamy's death in late 1977.\nCopyright Office, Library of Congress (1955).

                "description": "The Hollow Man (The Three Coffins in the US) is a 1935 locked room mystery novel set in London by the American writer John Dickson Carr, and featuring his recurring investigator Gideon Fell. It contains in chapter 17 the often-reprinted \"locked room lecture\" in which Dr Fell speaks directly to the reader, setting out the various ways in which murder can be committed in an apparently locked room or otherwise impossible situation. The book has received high praise from many critics, and in 1981 was selected as the best locked room mystery of all time by a panel of 17 mystery authors and reviewers.",

Professor Charles Grimaud's meeting with friends at a London tavern is interrupted by the illusionist Pierre Fley, who threatens Grimaud and warns of an even more dangerous brother who seeks Grimaud's life. Grimaud tells him to send his brother and be damned.\nA few nights later, a visitor concealing his identity with a false face arrives at Grimaud's house and is shown up to his study by the housekeeper, Mme Dumont. Grimaud's secretary, positioned with a view of the study door, sees Grimaud greet the visitor and let him in; he continues to watch until a shot is heard. Inside the room, Grimaud is found to be dying; but neither visitor nor weapon can be found, and there is unbroken snow outside the only window. On his deathbed, Grimaud makes a confusing statement confirming that his brother was responsible.\nGideon Fell discovers that before Grimaud settled in London he was known as Koroly Grimaud Horv\u00e1th, and that he had two brothers, one of whom now calls himself Fley. The three had, years earlier, tried to escape a Transylvanian labour camp by faking their own deaths and being buried alive in their coffins.\nA newspaper reports that minutes after Grimaud's shooting witnesses saw Fley walking alone down a snow-covered cul-de-sac, and heard a voice shout \"The second bullet is for you!\" followed by a gunshot. Fley is found dead in the snow with the revolver that killed him (and Grimaud) lying nearby. There are no tracks in the snow but his.\nWord is received from Transylvania that the three brothers had been imprisoned for bank robbery, and that after escaping his coffin Grimaud had deliberately left the other two to die. Fley had been saved and returned to prison, but the third brother had perished.\nFell reveals that Fley had been blackmailing Grimaud and threatening to disclose his part in the third brother's death. It was in fact Grimaud who had in retaliation been planning to kill Fley, not vice versa. Grimaud's elaborate plan had been to create the illusion that Fley had gone into the study, fired at him, then escaped from the window and returned to his own flat to commit suicide.\nIn reality, Grimaud went to Fley's flat, shot him, posed him as a suicide with the gun in his hand, then put on a cardboard overcoat and mask ready to impersonate his own visitor. But his plan went awry as Fley had not been killed outright, and managed to get out into the street to seek a doctor. When Grimauld accidentally showed himself, Fley screamed \"The second bullet is for you!\" and fired, dying from the effort. Though wounded, Grimaud managed to return to his own house and proceeded with his plan. He had previously positioned a large mirror just inside the study door, and as the door was opened he removed his hat (and mask) making it appear to the watching secretary that he was already in the room and was coming forward to greet his visitor. Once inside, he burned the cardboard items and hid the heavy mirror up in the chimney, the effort bringing on a final haemorrhage. He had just enough time to set off a firecracker to fake a gunshot.\nThe seeming impossibility of the crimes arose entirely by accident. Fley's shooting appeared to happen some minutes after Grimaud's because of an incorrectly-set clock in a shop window; and Grimaud had not anticipated snow, making Fley's purported escape from the window impossible.\nMme Dumont (now revealed to be Grimaud's accomplice and lover) confirms the correctness of Fell's solution, and kills herself.\nDr Gideon Fell: investigator\nProfessor Charles Vernet Grimaud (Koroly Grimaud Horv\u00e1th)\nRosette Grimaud: his daughter\nPierre Fley: his brother; illusionist\nMme Ernestine Dumont: Grimaud's housekeeper\nStuart Mills: Grimaud's secretary\nHubert Drayman: Grimaud's bookkeeper\nAnthony Pettir: collector of ghost stories\nJerome Burnaby: amateur criminologist\nBoyd Mangan: journalist\nThe novel has become noteworthy for the \"locked room lecture\" of chapter 17, Dr Fell's explanation to the reader of the various ways a person can commit a near-perfect murder in an apparently locked room or otherwise impossible situation. In their Catalogue of Crime (2nd edn 1982), Barzun and Taylor note that this lecture is very good indeed: \"twenty pages of sound reasoning and fine imagination in lively words\". They consider that the book deserves a permanent place on one's shelf for this lecture alone.\nIn The Story of Classic Crime in 100 Books (2017) Martin Edwards called this chapter, in which Dr Fell admits candidly that he is a character in a novel, \"an extraordinarily bold move\".

There are numerous themes in this novel which are expanded in later works, most notably a set of theories on the nature of and perception of reality (see Ilium).

After the death of his wife Gail, Jeremy Bremen leaves his previous life by burning his home and possessions and embarking on a journey to find peace from the \"neurobabble\" of humanity. Without his wife's presence Bremen cannot shield himself from the unwanted ability to read minds and hear thoughts.\nBremen searches for solitude and isolation from people, which he initially finds; however, as the novel progresses, he is exposed to increasing levels of contact with humanity and horrifying experiences of malicious and violent behaviour.\nTransposed with Bremen's story is that of another character, Robby, who appears to be narrating and commenting upon Bremen and his wife's life. Robby is severely disabled and unable to communicate as he is deaf, mute, and blind. How he is able to have such familiarity with Bremen is not disclosed until towards the end of the novel.\n\"The Hollow Man by Dan Simmons\". goodreads.com.

Double Star is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, first serialized in Astounding Science Fiction (February, March, and April 1956) and published in hardcover the same year. It received the 1956 Hugo Award for Best Novel (his first).\nThe noted science-fiction writer and critic James Blish was no fan of Heinlein's treatment of his first-person protagonists in a number of his novels. Writing in 1957, however, Blish says that \"The only first-person narrator Heinlein has created who is a living, completely independent human being is The Great Lorenzo of Double Star.  Lorenzo is complete all the way back to his childhood\u2014the influence of his father upon what he thinks is one of the strongest motives in the story\u2014and his growth under pressure is consistent with his character and no-one else's.\"\nGalaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel, finding it \"an excellent example of Heinlein's ability to take one of the oldest plots in any literature ... and present it as an enjoyable reading experience.\" Admitting \"a certain reservation, even disappointment,\" Anthony Boucher nevertheless concluded that Heinlein was \"simply creating an agreeably entertaining light novel, and in that task he succeeds admirably.\"\nAt the 1957 Worldcon it received the Hugo Award for Best Novel (his first) of the previous year.\nIn 2012, the novel was selected for inclusion in the Library of America two-volume boxed set American Science Fiction: Nine Classic Novels of the 1950s, edited by Gary K. Wolfe.\nThe cover illustration for a 1970s UK edition of Double Star (artist: Anthony Roberts) was the subject of an unlikely controversy when it was used as the basis of an entry for the 2000 Turner Prize for modern art.

Z for Zachariah is a post-apocalyptic science-fiction novel by Robert C. O'Brien that was published posthumously in 1974. The name Robert C. O'Brien was the pen name used by Robert Leslie Conly. After the author's death in 1973, his wife Sally M. Conly and daughter Jane Leslie Conly completed the book guided by his notes. Set in the United States, the story is in the form of a diary written from the first-person perspective of sixteen-year-old Ann Burden, who has survived a nuclear war and nerve gas through living in a small valley with a self-contained weather system.\nAccording to Sally Conly, Z for Zachariah was her husband's second novel intended for adults, following his 1972 science-fiction thriller A Report from Group 17. O'Brien had previously established himself as a children's writer with his novels The Silver Crown (1968) and Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971). Z for Zachariah received a 1976 honor award from the Jane Addams Children's Book Award and the Edgar Award for the best mystery fiction in the juvenile category.\nIt is revealed that, as a child, Ann had owned a Biblical ABC book which mentioned the prophet Zachariah. She remembers thinking that if Adam (who was used for the letter \"A\") was the first man on earth, Zachariah (who represented the letter \"Z\") must be the last, and likens this to her status as the last survivor of the war.\nThe story's events are set almost entirely in Burden Valley, a small and remote valley somewhere in the USA. It was named after the protagonist's ancestors, who were its first settlers and built a farm in the northern end. The only other inhabitants were the Kleins, a couple who owned the store and mainly did business with Amish farmers to the south.\nThe valley is approximately 4 miles long, from Burden Hill in the north to an S-shaped pass in the south called \"the gap\". The largest of its two streams, Burden Creek, is radioactive because its source is outside the valley. It runs parallel to the road from north to south and exits the valley through the gap. A smaller stream originates from a deep spring on an eastern hillside and feeds a small lake with fish that provide a food source for Ann. The stream then meanders south and joins Burden Creek. Much of the valley is made up of woodlands.\nAnn initially thinks the animals in the Valley are probably the last of their species; however, at the end of the book Loomis reveals he has seen birds flying in the distance west of the valley, which implies other life as well. There are rabbits and squirrels in the valley. There are also some crows, which Ann believes survived because only they had the \"sense\" to stay in the valley, while other birds migrated. There are two cows, a bull calf, and chickens on Ann's farm. Finally, there is the dog, Faro, who belonged to Ann's cousin David.\nThe most important feature of the valley is that it is somehow separated from the surrounding atmosphere and has its own weather system. Loomis calls it a meteorological enclave created by an inversion (i.e., air only rising, not falling), but he views its existence as so unlikely that it is only a theoretical possibility.\nSeeing the story as a conflict between an innocent girl and a domineering male scientist bent on controlling the valley, reviewers have found themes such as the destructiveness of science (at least when it is separated from conscience), the corrupting effect of the desire for power, and the moral value of individual freedom. Ann's sensitivity and love of nature are viewed as contrasting with Loomis' callous reasoning and selfish compulsion to take control. Writing for The Spectator in April 1975, Peter Ackroyd concludes that \"science turns paradise sour.\" Reviews the same year in The Junior Bookshelf and Times Literary Supplement described Ann as an unwilling Eve who \"finally refuses to begin the whole story over again.\" Another major theme of this book is survival, because the whole story is about surviving after a nuclear holocaust.\nSoon after the book was published it was serialised in the UK in the teenage magazine Jackie.\nIn February 1984, the BBC presented a film adaptation for its Play for Today series in which the setting was changed from America to Wales.\nZ for Zachariah, a 2015 film adaptation of the novel premiered in January 2015 with financing from Creative Artists Agency (CAA) and Material Pictures. Eschewing the central Adam/Eve theme and its deconstruction of abusive and controlling relationships, it adds a third character and involves a love triangle. It stars Margot Robbie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and  Chris"

Every day after school, Allie stops by the walled grounds of Villa Petrograd, property of the Soviet embassy, and climbs a tree to view monkeys at a small zoo there. Fond of animals, Allie is troubled that the monkeys keep dying mysteriously.  Unknown to her, the embassy holds the secret research lab of Helmuth Schutz, a former Nazi now developing bioweapons for the Soviets\u2014specifically, mutations of the bacteria coryna and anthracis.  Discovering Allie's spying, Schutz lures her into the compound by leaving a gate open and then kidnaps her for experiments.  When her bike is later found near the Potomac River upstream from dangerous rapids, the police assume she fell in accidentally and drowned. Only Allie's 5-year-old brother Willis knows where she went, but he has promised her to keep it secret.\nMeanwhile, the eminent biochemist Fergus O'Neil is recruited by the U.S. State Department, to study stolen Soviet reports from Schutz's Group 17, and investigate his activities at Villa Petrograd, by posing as a vacationer.  After taking water samples one day, O'Neil rescues John Adam from nearly drowning, while testing the police's theory about his sister's bike accident.  Sympathizing with the Adam family, and attracted to the recently widowed Mrs. Adam, O'Neil becomes personally concerned about Allie's disappearance.\nLater, reading Schutz's old reports, O'Neil notices an obscure reference to the Steinkopf (Stone Head) Syndrome. Through research, he learns of Schutz's interest in a native Peruvian society that had lived in a hidden valley of the Andes, but died out after their water supply was contaminated with a mutagen.  The name \"steinkopf\" refers to a giant stone head the natives built to propitiate their mountain god, in the hope he would lift the curse upon them.  The name also describes the natives' affliction, a condition of utter passivity that left them dependent on instructions for all of their activities. (The mutagen makes people unable to exert themselves except under orders.)  O'Neil discovers that throughout Schutz's reports there are hidden notes about private experiments to develop polywater with this mutagenic effect. These experiments continue a Nazi project to turn enemies of the Aryan \"master race\" into subservient Untermensch. After nightmares about Schutz experimenting on chimpanzees, O'Neil also suspects Schutz kidnapped Allie, because he needed a human subject for his private experiments.\nQuitting his job, so he can act independently, O'Neil joins an off-duty policeman on a night-time raid into the Soviet's compound to rescue Allie. But Schutz leaves the same night, taking Allie with him as a carrier of the polywater, and an example of its effect.  Aided by an efficient network of Nazi friends, including the German Secretary of Defense, Schutz escapes back to Germany. Fortunately for Allie, he is forced to leave her in an airport when a ticket seller identifies her, and she is finally reunited with her mother. However, Allie has already become passive and emotionless, and it is unknown if her condition can be reversed.  The story finishes with a brief epilogue that explains O'Neil's new job analyzing \"Water X\", a German expedition's \"accidental\" destruction of Incan ruins, and Schutz's comfortable life in Germany, where he has a new identity as a professor and his biochemical research is progressing well.\nAs in O'Brien's Z for Zachariah, the geographical setting is unclear and largely fictitious. Events take place mainly at Seneca Lake, in the countryside about 20 miles from Washington DC.  At one end of the lake are the walled grounds of Villa Petrograd, an estate owned by the Soviet embassy and considered Russian soil.  The Adam family's farm is on a hill up a rough gravel road from the estate. From the gate Allison Adam enters, the hill is to the left, and the road to the right continues parallel to the estate's wall until it ends in a marshy area that borders the Potomac River. According to Colonel Attenborough, Seneca Lake is upstream from the Great Falls of the Potomac. The Little Seneca Reservoir in Montgomery County was created by one of two dams built in the 1980s to provide backup water sources for times of low flow in the Potomac.  The author's family lived on a small farm beside the Potomac and near Leesburg, Virginia.\nA 1972 Kirkus review described A Report from Group 17 as a thriller similar to Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain. It was also chosen by the Book of the Month Club.\nThe author Adam"

Ann Burden is a teenage girl who believes she is the last survivor of a nuclear war. Since her family's disappearance on a search expedition, she has lived alone on her farm in a small valley spared from radiation poisoning. A year after the war, a stranger in a radiation-proof suit approaches her valley. Afraid he might be dangerous, Ann hides in a cave and does not warn the man when he mistakenly bathes in a radioactive stream. When he falls ill, her fear of being alone forever leads her to reveal herself to help him. She discovers that the stranger is John Loomis, a chemist who helped design a prototype radiation-proof \"safe-suit\" at an underground lab near Ithaca, New York. Ann moves him into her house and fantasizes about eventually marrying him.\nLoomis becomes delirious, with traumatic flashbacks to the underground lab. He talks of how he shot his coworker, Edward, who tried to take the safe-suit to find his family. Though troubled by this revelation, Ann nurses him through his illness and keeps secret her knowledge of Edward's death. As Loomis recovers, Ann is taken aback when he forbids her to touch the safe-suit and begins giving her orders on farming and managing resources. His explanation that they have to plan \"as if this valley is the whole world and we are starting a colony,\" makes her uneasy. Her uneasiness increases when she asks if he was ever married, and he grabs her hand roughly, rebuking her when she accidentally hits him while trying to regain her balance. One night soon afterwards, she awakes to hear Loomis in her room. When he attempts to rape her, she flees to the cave again.\nLater, Ann approaches Loomis and proposes sharing the valley and farm work but living apart. He professes surprise when she tells him she won't live with him anymore and asks why, as if he has no idea. Ann remembers that he acted the same after he had grabbed her hand, \"as if nothing had happened, or as if he had forgotten it,\" She refuses to justify her choice to him, to tell him where she is living, or to come back to live with him. Loomis answers that he has no choice but to accept her proposal, though he hopes she will reconsider and \"act more like an adult and less like a schoolgirl\". Though the arrangement is \"unnatural and uneasy,\" and Ann worries about surviving winter, she sticks by her decision and wishes Loomis had never come.  Loomis locks the store, cutting off her supplies. When she approaches him for the key, Loomis shoots her in the ankle. Ann flees, realizing that he had not shot to kill, only to lame her to make her easy to capture. Loomis uses her dog, Faro, to track her to the cave, where he burns her belongings, though Ann escapes. Ann's ankle wound becomes infected. As she recovers, she has feverish dreams of another valley where children wait for her to teach them. Ann comes to believe the dreams may be true and Loomis is insane, so she plans to steal the safe-suit and find her dream valley. Moreover, she decides to kill Faro to prevent Loomis from tracking her, though she is later unable to do so. However, Faro is fatally poisoned swimming across the dead creek to her.\nAnn finally acts on her plan. She lures Loomis from the house with a note offering to talk if he meets her unarmed, then steals the safe-suit and waits for Loomis to arrive. When he does, she reveals her knowledge of Edward's murder, which shocks Loomis enough to stop him from shooting her. He begs her not to leave him alone. Ann tells him she will send people to him if she finds any, and leaves. Loomis's last action is to call out that he once saw birds circling to the west. Ann walks west into the radiated zone, hoping to see a green horizon.\nIt is revealed that, as a child, Ann had owned a Biblical ABC book which mentioned the prophet Zachariah. She remembers thinking that if Adam (who was used for the letter \"A\") was the first man on earth, Zachariah (who represented the letter \"Z\") must be the last, and likens this to her status as the last survivor of the war.\nThe story's events are set almost entirely in Burden Valley, a small and remote valley somewhere in the USA.

When Rees was planning his Cyclop\u00e6dia, Europe was in the aftermath of the French Revolution, and during serialised publication (1802\u20131820) the Napoleonic Wars and War of 1812 occurred. Britain absorbed into its empire a number of the former French and Dutch colonies around the world; Romanticism came to the fore; evangelical Christianity flourished with the efforts of William Wilberforce; and factory manufacture burgeoned.\nWith this background, philosophical radicalism was suspect in Britain, and aspects of the Cyclop\u00e6dia were thought to be distinctly subversive and attracted the hostility of the Loyalist press. Contributors Jeremiah Joyce and Charles Sylvester had attracted the attention of the government and were tried for their views. The editor and authors went to great pains to emphasise their Englishness, to the extent of anglicising many French words: the French Kings Louis appear under the heading \"Lewis\".\nScientific theorising about the atomic system, geological succession, and earth origins; natural history (botany, entomology, ornithology and zoology); and developments in technology, particularly in textiles manufacture, are all reflected in the Cyclop\u00e6dia.\nOther topics include exploration and foreign travel which provide insights into how the world was viewed at that time. Agriculture and rural life also feature greatly.\nThe Cyclop\u00e6dia appeared serially between January 1802 and August 1820, and ran to 39 volumes of text and 6 volumes of plates including an atlas. It contains around 39 million words, and around 500 of the articles are of monograph length. The sheets were produced weekly, and issued as half-volume sets several times a year. The dates of these can be seen on table 4.1 below. Only one set of the work in half-volumes (which also has some of the paper wrappers) is known to survive, in the library of the Natural History Museum, London.\nThe plates were published in 6 volumes: four covering general articles, one on natural history, and one atlas. They were issued as blocks and so do not appear to have been issued with the texts in the half-volumes. There are 1107 plates, and atlas with 61 folded maps 16\" by 10\" in size. Bound at the back of Volume 39 are lists of all the plates and an index to them.\nThe American edition was published by Samuel F. Bradford (see fr:Samuel F. Bradford), of Philadelphia. Bradford was a member of the famous family of American printers. The first volume appeared in May 1806 and the last in December 1820. The work extended to 41 volumes of text and 6 of plates. See section 5 below.\nThe growth of industrial archaeology led to the reprinting in the 1970s by the British publisher David and Charles of volumes covering manufacturing industry, naval architecture, and horology.\nIn the 1980s the Swiss publishing house IDC produced a microfiche edition.\nThe first decades of the 19th century saw many encyclopaediae published in Britain. Examples included:\nThe fourth, fifth and sixth editions of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica in 20 volumes, 1801\u20131810, 1815\u20131817, and 1823\u20131824.\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Perthensis or Universal Dictionary of Arts, Science and Literature, 23 volumes, Edinburgh 1807.\nEdinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia, 18 volumes, 1808\u20131830, ed. David Brewster.\nBritish Encyclopedia, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, 6 volumes, 1809, ed. William Nicholson.\nPantologia, 12 volumes, 1813, ed. John Mason Good, Olinthus Gregory, Newton Bosworth.\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana, 28 volumes, 1817\u20131845, edited initially by Samuel Taylor Coleridge\nEncyclopaedia Londinensis 24 volumes,1810\u20131828, including 3 volumes of plates, ed. John Wilkes\nThese sources commonly fed off each other, and writers often contributed to more than one.\nThe Cyclop\u00e6dia had comparatively little reception on publication. The Anti-Jacobin Review published hostile reviews of half-volume 1 in 1802, and of volumes 2\u20134 in 1804-5. These reviews complained about its supposed antireligious aspects and radical standpoints attributed to its editor and contributors, and cited lack of article balance, confusing alphabetisation, and cross-references to then-unpublished volumes. The British Critic less stridently criticised lack of balance and confusion in volume 1. The Panoplist carried a serial review of both editions of Rees by Jedediah Morse in 1807\u20131810.\nThe Quarterly Review commented, \"Rees is the most extensive cyclop\u00e6dia in English with many excellent articles it has generally been condemned as on the whole too diffuse and too commonplace.\"\nThe exhaustive article on encyclopaediae in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th edition (1910) mentions Rees's involvement with the editing of the original Chambers, but ignores completely the later work.

It contains a selection of essays and fragments of stories by J. R. R. Tolkien,  edited by the scholar Carl F. Hostetter, on questions related to the functioning of his fantasy world, Middle-earth. \nThe book's editor Carl F. Hostetter said in an interview before the book appeared that he \"started work on what would become The Nature of Middle-earth nearly 25 years ago, when I received a bundle of photocopies that Christopher Tolkien referred to as \u201clate philological essays\u201d.\"\nThe book is in three parts, with appendices. Part One consists of 23 chapters on \"Time and Ageing\", including the Valian Year and questions of time-scales and whether elvish time is different. Part Two contains 17 chapters on \"Body, Mind, and Spirit\", including issues of beauty, goodness, gender, and sex; which beings may have beards; fate and free will; whether elves reincarnate; what the Valar know and what visible forms they and the Maiar may take; and death. Part Three consists of 22 chapters on \"The World, its Lands, and its Inhabitants\", including such topics as darkness and light, how Lembas waybread is made, the eating of mushrooms, and Galadriel and Celeborn. The appendices cover metaphysical and theological themes, and a glossary of terms in Quenya.\nShaun Gunner of The Tolkien Society called the book \"an unofficial 13th volume of The History of Middle-earth series\". \nThe historian Bradley J. Birzer wrote in the National Review that this \"new volume confirms that Tolkien was the 20th century's greatest mythmaker, and that his mythology will \u2014 if there is justice in the world \u2014 rank someday with that of Homer, Virgil, and Dante. Just as Homer gave us profound insights into the Greek world, Virgil into the Roman world, and Dante into the medieval world, Tolkien gave us great insights into the modern world.

The aliens say they cannot speak for their people and walk out, summoning more senior officials.  The officials seem agreeable there should be no war, but impose not a division between the two peoples, rather, they tell Earth it can no longer expand, then they walk out.\nThe FTL ship crew agree to return home with the bad news, which they believe will lead to war, but they get lost in the alternate space and return to normal space in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  The captain believes they should simply concede and find a place to live, even as the Milky Way tantalizes them in the sky of the planet they are borne to by a mysterious alien.\nThe Magellanic aliens summon the officials from Earth's opponents, and force an equal division of the Milky Way, then return the Milky Way citizens to where they were\u2014the FTL ship right back to where it was before its faulty attempt to return home.

On his evening walk one Wednesday night fifteen-year-old Ray got tempted by a Honda 125 motorbike outside a pub with its engine running so he got on and went for a joyride. He rode to the neighbouring village of Blackston and on his way back to the city he collided with a woman, who he saw earlier in an Austin Mini, and killed her. Ray walked back to the city and decided to take the bus rather than walk home in his weakened state. However, when the conductor came to collect the fare Ray remembered that he did not have any money on him so the conductor asked for his name and address so the company could send him a bill. Ray gave him fake details and was reminded not to go on the bus without any money and when he got home he went straight to bed and locked the door to hide his injuries from his family.\nIn the morning Ray washed the blood from his pillow case, hair and the inside of his hood then checked the daily newspaper. On page six was a report about the collision saying that police investigations were underway.\nThat afternoon in school the history teacher chose that day to teach them about Sir Robert Peel and developments in the police force including crime detection methods. A girl in the class asked a question about whether it was true that only 40% of all crimes were detected and solved then a couple of other pupils also heard about that figure reassuring Ray about the fallibility of the police. At the end of the school day Ray found on the notice board that he made it onto the school football team as a reserve but on his way out he saw a police car pull into the school gates so Ray went back in see what it was about. Ray waited outside the headmaster\u2019s office trying to listen but only caught a few short words. Back home Ray\u2019s mother told him that his grandmother was ill which she was worried about and he made her more upset when he told her that he forgot to buy the sausages for tea that he promised her he would get. In the bath Ray thought about committing suicide using a razor blade but decided against it deciding that he would get through the whole affair of his guilt.\nThe next morning at breakfast Ray checked the local weekly paper and it had a report of the hit and run incident on the front page where the woman was named as Mrs. Maureen Chalmers and the police were still trying to trace the rider of the stolen bike. At the table Ray was taken ill and his mother told him to stay home and rest then he reassured her that he would be all right at home whilst she visited her mother who had the doctor round.\nIn the afternoon Ray felt better and decided to go to school. When he got there his friend Dave Fitzroy told him that Mrs. Chalmers was the wife of a school governor so they had a minutes silence and prayers for her in assembly that morning. After English and PE lessons he went home where his mother told him that grandma was not too good and the doctor said she would have to go to hospital for a check-up.\nThat evening Ray went for a ride on his push bike having the urge to return to the scene of the crime. At the collision site was a signboard with a police appeal for witnesses.\nThe next morning Ray had a football match with the school team at another school. Rays team won though he injured an opponent by accident but his teammates and PE teacher agreed that it was a fair tackle.\nAt home that afternoon Ray was told that grandma was much worse and she would probably have to have an operation.

After getting drunk on wine Ray met a girl named Anna who he liked and danced with her. Just before he left Anna told Ray that he could phone her and her number was in the book.\nWhen Ray got home he slept until 12.35 in the day.

On his evening walk one Wednesday night fifteen-year-old Ray got tempted by a Honda 125 motorbike outside a pub with its engine running so he got on and went for a joyride. He rode to the neighbouring village of Blackston and on his way back to the city he collided with a woman, who he saw earlier in an Austin Mini, and killed her. Ray walked back to the city and decided to take the bus rather than walk home in his weakened state. However, when the conductor came to collect the fare Ray remembered that he did not have any money on him so the conductor asked for his name and address so the company could send him a bill. Ray gave him fake details and was reminded not to go on the bus without any money and when he got home he went straight to bed and locked the door to hide his injuries from his family.\nIn the morning Ray washed the blood from his pillow case, hair and the inside of his hood then checked the daily newspaper. On page six was a report about the collision saying that police investigations were underway.\nThat afternoon in school the history teacher chose that day to teach them about Sir Robert Peel and developments in the police force including crime detection methods. A girl in the class asked a question about whether it was true that only 40% of all crimes were detected and solved then a couple of other pupils also heard about that figure reassuring Ray about the fallibility of the police. At the end of the school day Ray found on the notice board that he made it onto the school football team as a reserve but on his way out he saw a police car pull into the school gates so Ray went back in see what it was about.

The narrator is Jean Ange, alias John Angelos, born in Avignon. Prior to the events of the novel, he had been a friend of Sultan Murad II and then also of his son, Mehmed II; but once Mehmed had begun his march to Constantinople, Ange fled there.\nThe novel begins as Jean Ange meets Anna Notaras in Constantinople and they fall instantly in love. At first Ange is unaware of her identity, but later he realises she is the daughter of megas doux Lucas Notaras.\nAnge is committed to fight to the death on the side of the Christians against the Islamic Ottoman forces. Nevertheless, his prior relationship with Mehmed earns him constant distrust from both Latin and Greek Christians.\nEventually Jean Ange is revealed as a rightful heir of Byzantine emperors, although he has no interest in power. Constantinople ultimately falls under Mehmed's attack, Anna dies while in the disguise of a soldier, and Jean is tortured to death by Mehmed.\nThe novel, written in a diary format, was inspired by a real diary by Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro describing the 1453 siege of Constantinople. The character of Angelos especially had his basis on a marginal note in red ink mentioning a Greek traitor for the Turks by the name of Angelo Zacaria. Scholar Panu Rajala visited Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana, which held both a copy and the original, and read from the checkout list that Mika Waltari was the fourth one to be allowed to examine the book, in 7 November 1952.\nWaltari abandoned an early draft, closer to his previous novels in structure, which was published posthumously in 1981 as Nuori Johannes.\n\nRajala, Panu (21 May 2017). \"Panu Rajala todisti professorin ep\u00e4ilyn turhaksi: Mika Waltari ei keksinyt p\u00e4\u00e4st\u00e4\u00e4n menestysteokseen liittyv\u00e4\u00e4 tarinaa\".

Tanaqui, the narrator, is a young woman living in a small town called Shelling, which lies beside the Great River. She and her four siblings look different from the rest of the townsfolk, and instead of worshiping the River, their family has three idols\u2014the so-called Undying. When the country is invaded by the Heathens (who are modelled after Europeans and are the ancestors of the people of Dalemark in the other three novels) who look like them, Tanaqui and her siblings flee to avoid being killed by the people of their own village.\nTanaqui's narration in The Spellcoats is not her diary, nor is it being \"told\" as many stories are. Rather, Tanaqui is weaving the story into a pair of \"spellcoats\" that she is making.\nThe first spellcoat tells of how the five siblings (Gull, Robin, Hern, Tanaqui and Duck) travelled downriver on their boat. First, they encounter the mysterious magician Tanamil, then the Heathen king Kars Adon, and finally, at the sea, the evil mage Kankredin, whose aim is to take over the power of the river by taking over the five children's souls. In the middle of this Gull was bound like the One, Tanamil (Younger Amil or the young one) and the Lady.\nThe second spellcoat tells how, after their escape from Kankredin, the five siblings are captured by their own King, \"the king of the natives\" (who are modelled after Native Americans and Hawaiians and are the ancestors of the Holy Islanders in Drowned Ammet) who has lost his kingdom and is drifting with the remains of his army trying to avoid the Heathens. The King keeps the children in his company because he needs one of the children's idols\u2014the powerful One\u2014to assist him in his pursuits. As Tanaqui continues to weave during her travel upriver with the King, she realises that the spellcoats that Kankredin and his mages wore gave them the powers that were woven into their spellcoats. She becomes convinced that the words woven into her spellcoats will have the power to defeat Kankredin.\nRealizing that Tanaqui is the only one able to stop Kankredin and his mages with her weaving, her elder brother Hern convinces the combined forces of their own people and the Heathens to make a stand at the headwaters of the Great River, and hold off Kankredin while Tanaqui completes her second spellcoat. Tanaqui weaves frantically to catch up to her \"present,\" and finally she completes her spellcoat with a waking vision she experiences. In this vision, their eldest family idol called The One rises up, crushes Kankredin, and shakes the land into a new shape. We do not find out from Tanaqui's narration if she succeeds or fails, because she must finish the spellcoat and put it on the idol before the spellcoat's woven spell can take effect.\nIn an epilogue written by Elthorar Ansdaughter, Keeper of Antiquities, we learn that the spellcoats were discovered hundreds of years later, during the approximate time period of Drowned Ammet and Cart and Cwidder, in the mountains of North Dalemark near Hannart. Elthorar notes the close correspondence between various figures in the stories and their apparent counterparts in the legends and folktales of the people of Dalemark. She also tries and fails to determine the places described, leading the reader to conclude that Tanaqui's vision came to pass, Kankredin was defeated, and The One reshaped the land.\nLike the other three novels of the Dalemark Quartet, The Spellcoats is a story about a physical journey, during which revelations occur. As in the other three books, the presence of magic is not readily apparent at its beginning, but slowly creeps into the story.\n\nThe five sons and daughters of Closti the Clam, born and raised in the village of Shelling across the River. Although their father never left Shelling, his children look like the heathens with their blond hair.\nGull \u2013 The second eldest of Closti the Clam's five children. He goes off to war with his father, but is the only one to return. When he comes home from war, his mind has deteriorated and his siblings must look after him. In actuality, he isn't crazy, but caught in a spell by the mage Kankredin, who wants to use Gull's soul to reach the One.\nRobin \u2013 Tanaqui's sister, eldest of the five. She falls in love with Tanamil, but is married against her will to the King. This puts her younger brother Hern in a straight line of succession to the King.\nHern \u2013 Tanaqui's older brother, Hern is extremely \"reasonable\" and resists admitting that magic exists.

Earthlight is a science fiction novel by British writer Arthur\u00a0C. Clarke, published in 1955. It is an expansion to novel length of a novella of the same name that he had published four years earlier.\nEarthlight is a science fiction adventure story set on the Moon, where a government agent is looking for a suspected spy at a major observatory on the Moon.  The context is strong tension between Earth (which controls the Moon) and independent settlers elsewhere in the Solar System.  The year is not given, but it is some time in the 22nd century.  There have been no wars for the last 200 years.\nEvents are low-key: the government agent is a mild-mannered accountant who does not like the task.  He notices the beauty of the Moon under 'earthlight'; the Earth in the sky far bigger than the Moon in the skies of Earth.\nThe story proceeds with very few violent incidents, though it does climax in a space battle. There is also an enigma - the apparent sighting of a 'beam of light', that should not be possible on the airless world. This is explained later in the story as a weapons beam that included metal particulates moving at high velocity.\nEven though many of Clarke's science fiction novels take place in rather similar futures\u2014Earthlight, A Fall of Moondust, The Sands of Mars, Rendezvous with Rama\u2014the human background is never quite the same and they do not form a series.\nGroff Conklin characterized Earthlight as \"a fairly standard type of melodrama [but] developed with all of the author's abundant ability to make even melodrama plausible.\" Floyd C. Gale stated that the novel had \"some of the most inspired descriptive writing in or out of science fiction ... a thoroughgoing delight ... Worth reading and rereading\". Anthony Boucher praised the novel as a convincingly real, scientifically detailed story of the near future, yet infused with that sense of wonder and excitement that we sometimes think vanished from literature about the time our voices changed.\"\nAt the time of the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, Lester del Rey expressed regret in his review of the film that Earthlight had not been filmed instead.\nThe weapon developed in the story by Earth, which uses an electromagnet-propelled bayonet of liquid metal, is said to have inspired DARPA to develop a weapon along the same lines.\nEarthlight was first published in 1955, in the US by Ballantine Books and in the UK by Frederick Muller Ltd, and was last printed as a paperback in New York by Del Rey in 1998, ISBN\u00a00-345-43070-0. It was later republished in an omnibus edition including Islands in the Sky, Earthlight and The Sands of Mars and called \"The Space Trilogy\".\nThe space battle in Earthlight is the only time Clarke wrote such a scene, and it was intended as a specific homage to the attack on the Mardonalian fortress in chapter seven of E. E. Smith's Skylark Three. The scene where the crew of the Acheron have to cross to the Pegasus without space suits was inspired by Stanley G. Weinbaum's \"The Red Peri\".\nThe crew of Apollo 15 named several craters near their landing site at Hadley\u2013Apennine for science fiction novels and one was named Earthlight, for Clarke's book.  Clarke was delighted to receive a three-dimensional map of the landing site signed and sent by the Apollo 15 crew, two decades after the novel was written.\nThe story describes regions of heavy metal resources concentrated in certain areas beneath some of the Lunar maria. This anticipates the later discovery of mass concentrations or Mascons, by surveys of the Moon carried out prior to the Apollo landings by the Lunar Orbiter missions, although mascons on the moon probably don't represent bodies of ore.\nTuck, Donald H.

The story begins at Larklight, a house that orbits Earth's moon, where the Mumbys receive a visitor from the Royal Xenological Society, a Mr. Webster, who is revealed to be an extra-terrestrial resembling an enormous white spider. Art and his sister Myrtle escape; but their father is captured and presumed dead.\nArt and Myrtle leave in an escape pod and crash-land on the Moon, where they are encased with predatory larvae of the Potter Moth and freed by pirate Jack Havock and his crew. Art is shocked to find that Jack is only fifteen years old, and that he is the only human in his crew, while Myrtle is distressed at being in the company of a pirate and demands that Jack take them to the Moon's British residence, Fort George. En route aboard the pirates' ship Sophronia, a ship of the British Navy comes alongside and orders Jack to surrender or have his ship destroyed.\nJack distracts the officers by pretending to hold Art and Myrtle hostage, giving Ssillissa, the ship's alchemist, time to activate the ship's engines and fly the Sophronia to safety. They conceal themselves on Venus, Jack Havock's old home, where Jack tells Art and Myrtle that the colonists there, including his parents and brother, were changed into trees by a sudden pollination. The white spiders take Myrtle to the Martian home of industrialist Sir Waverly Rain, whose factories cover Phobos and Deimos. She escapes with a Martian maid named Ulla and her husband, Richard, with whom she learns that Sir Waverly Rain had been captured by the spiders and replaced with a spider-controlled automaton; believing the spiders might manufacture something much more sinister, they race to London.\nJack and Art visit Jupiter's moon Io, descending into Jupiter's atmosphere to ask aid of the Thunderhead, who tells them to protect the key to Larklight. Not knowing what this is, they attempt to leave Jupiter, but are abandoned by their ferryman and escape to a broken-down harpoon ship attached to a native organism. They are rescued by the Sophronia's crew. Jack discovers that Myrtle's locket (now in Art's possession) is the key to Larklight, in that it can activate a set of complex engines capable of transforming the solar system, and leads his crew to the spiders' home on the Rings of Saturn to exchange it for Myrtle's safe return.\nUpon arriving at the spiders' home, most of the crew are captured. Art is later taken before Professor Phineas Ptarmigan, formerly of the Royal Xenological Institute where Jack was imprisoned until he was twelve, who reveals that he wishes to use Larklight to destroy the Solar System, leaving the remains to the spiders whose ancestors had colonized the planetesimals. Meanwhile, Ssillissa and her crewmate Yarg free the captured crew and two additional prisoners, Sir Waverly and Art's mother Emily.\nHaving freed Larklight from the spiders, the protagonists visit Earth, where a gigantic mechanical spider is attacking London. There, Myrtle takes control of the machine and uses it to kill Mr. Webster, and later re-unites with her family and Jack. The epilogue reveals that the race of white spiders has not been exterminated, but subdued, and that Ptarmigan has been placed in an insane asylum. The Mumby family return to live at Larklight, which they deprive of its otherworldly machinery.\nWarner Bros. bought the rights to Larklight in 2006. In April 2008, Shekhar Kapur announced that he was to direct, and that he and Steven Knight had been working on the screenplay for three months. He said that it would have a budget of $200\u00a0million and would be his most expensive movie. Alison Greenspan and Di Novi were to produce. The film was to be released on 1 January 2010, but after the death of the director Anthony Minghella in 2008, Kapur took over his unfinished movie New York, I Love You, and postponed Larklight.\nMars in fiction\nVenus in fiction\nBorys Kit, Nyay Bushan (31 March 2008). \"\"Elizabeth\" director aglow for \"Larklight\"\".

Knopf sold by Random House LLC. In 1945 at the end of the war, Nathaniel's father and mother decide to leave London for a year to go to Singapore, where Nathaniel's father is being stationed. The parents decide to leave their children, 14-year-old Nathaniel and his older sister Rachel, in the care of their lodger, Walter, known as The Moth. The children both have the impression that The Moth is a thief. Nathaniel's mother claims to know The Moth because they were both in charge of fire watching at the Grosvenor House Hotel during the war but their stories about the war imply that they had other, secretive war jobs.\nNathaniel and Rachel are supposed to be boarders at their school when their parents leave, but after complaining to The Moth they are allowed to live at their home which is now populated by an odd mix of characters. One of these is The Moth's friend, The Darter, who imports greyhounds into England for the purpose of illegal gambling and ferries explosives by barge from Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills into central London. The Darter helps Nathaniel gain employment, first at a restaurant where he meets a working-class girl, Agnes Street, who he develops a relationship with, and later employing him to aid in smuggling. When Agnes thinks that Nathaniel does not want to introduce her to his parents because he is ashamed of her, Nathaniel has The Darter pretend to be his father. The Darter similarly helps Rachel, who develops epilepsy during this time period, by teaching Nathaniel how to deal with the symptoms, and helping Rachel find employment in a theatre. \nAfter the year has elapsed and his parents have still not returned, Nathaniel begins to suspect he is being followed, and also that his mother is still somewhere in England, possibly also in London. One night while out with Rachel and The Moth, all three are attacked by men who have been following Nathaniel for some time. When Nathaniel awakens, he and Rachel have already been rescued. He is also able to see his mother, briefly, who implies that giving up the children was part of a deal she made to ensure their safety. Shortly thereafter, Nathaniel and Rachel are separated and re-homed, with Rachel going to boarding school in the country, and Nathaniel briefly attending a boarding school in America. \nIn 1959 Nathaniel, now an adult, is recruited by the Foreign Office to help in a mass censorship of post-WWII espionage activities, the censorship being known as The Silent Correction. Nathaniel buys a home in The Saints where his mother grew up and where he briefly lived with her after his return from America. Nathaniel also tries to connect with members of his past but The Moth is dead after their attack and almost everyone else has scattered. He and Rachel have a tense relationship though he eventually learns he has a nephew, named Walter after The Moth.\nNathaniel's personal reason for accepting his Foreign Office work is to look for traces of his mother. Though he is never handed any documents that refer to her, Nathaniel begins breaking into the office and temporarily stealing files to try to learn more about her and her activities. He realises that one of the much higher up employees also attended his mother's funeral and that he is also a man named Marsh Felon, who his mother knew when they were both children and Felon's family worked for hers. Through a few sparse details from the files and in recollecting information given to him by his mother in the brief time they lived together in The Saints, Nathaniel tries to trace his mother's war work and her relationship with Felon and imagines that they were both friends and lovers. They had worked with partisans in Yugoslavia and it is the daughter of a victim of the partisans in the Foibe massacres who tracks down and kills his mother.\nNathaniel also discovers that some of The Darter's so-called illicit activities were done in service to the war and post-war efforts. While digging in the archives he finds The Darter's real name, Norman Marshall, and a current address and goes to visit him. He is surprised to find The Darter married with a daughter though he does not meet either of them. Upon leaving he sees a piece of embroidery with a quote that Agnes loved and he realises that The Darter is married to Agnes and their child was likely fathered by Nathaniel. Despite entertaining a fantasy that he will one day run into his daughter, Nathaniel continues to live his mostly solitary life leaving Agnes and her family undisturbed.\nNathaniel Williams, the narrator\nRachel Williams, his sister\nRose Williams, Nathaniel and Rachel's mother\nFelon, a friend and lover of Rose"

The story begins at Larklight, a house that orbits Earth's moon, where the Mumbys receive a visitor from the Royal Xenological Society, a Mr. Webster, who is revealed to be an extra-terrestrial resembling an enormous white spider. Art and his sister Myrtle escape; but their father is captured and presumed dead.\nArt and Myrtle leave in an escape pod and crash-land on the Moon, where they are encased with predatory larvae of the Potter Moth and freed by pirate Jack Havock and his crew. Art is shocked to find that Jack is only fifteen years old, and that he is the only human in his crew, while Myrtle is distressed at being in the company of a pirate and demands that Jack take them to the Moon's British residence, Fort George. En route aboard the pirates' ship Sophronia, a ship of the British Navy comes alongside and orders Jack to surrender or have his ship destroyed.\nJack distracts the officers by pretending to hold Art and Myrtle hostage, giving Ssillissa, the ship's alchemist, time to activate the ship's engines and fly the Sophronia to safety. They conceal themselves on Venus, Jack Havock's old home, where Jack tells Art and Myrtle that the colonists there, including his parents and brother, were changed into trees by a sudden pollination. The white spiders take Myrtle to the Martian home of industrialist Sir Waverly Rain, whose factories cover Phobos and Deimos. She escapes with a Martian maid named Ulla and her husband, Richard, with whom she learns that Sir Waverly Rain had been captured by the spiders and replaced with a spider-controlled automaton; believing the spiders might manufacture something much more sinister, they race to London.\nJack and Art visit Jupiter's moon Io, descending into Jupiter's atmosphere to ask aid of the Thunderhead, who tells them to protect the key to Larklight. Not knowing what this is, they attempt to leave Jupiter, but are abandoned by their ferryman and escape to a broken-down harpoon ship attached to a native organism. They are rescued by the Sophronia's crew. Jack discovers that Myrtle's locket (now in Art's possession) is the key to Larklight, in that it can activate a set of complex engines capable of transforming the solar system, and leads his crew to the spiders' home on the Rings of Saturn to exchange it for Myrtle's safe return.\nUpon arriving at the spiders' home, most of the crew are captured. Art is later taken before Professor Phineas Ptarmigan, formerly of the Royal Xenological Institute where Jack was imprisoned until he was twelve, who reveals that he wishes to use Larklight to destroy the Solar System, leaving the remains to the spiders whose ancestors had colonized the planetesimals.

The novel explores the disintegration of a small group of a highly inbred people, descendants of two individuals whose spaceship crashed on a rogue planet they call Eden.

The novel begins about 160 years after two human beings, Angela and Tommy, are stranded on Eden. Their three companions\u2014Mehmet, Michael, and Dixon\u2014have left in a damaged spaceship to get help. Years have passed, and although Angela and Tommy initially held out hope for rescue, they begin to raise children, forming a new society which becomes known as \"Family\". Frequent and regular incest among their descendants is common, with few children knowing who their father is. Social life centers around powerful rituals: Retelling of story of the stranding, the worship of what few relics remain, myths about Earth, and the need to stay close to Circle\u2014the place where the landing vehicle originally set down, and is supposed to return to and bring them back to Earth. Social norms are strongly adhered to in this matriarchy, and innovation is rare.\nFamily lives in Circle Valley. Resources are stretched but they believe that leaving will make it hard for them to be found when Earth returns for them. Eden's animals each have two hearts, green-black blood, huge and lidless eyes, six legs, and tentacled feelers around their mouths. Trees tap into the heat just below Eden's surface, bringing up warmth and providing fruit and other food. Nearly all plant and animal life on Eden is bioluminescent, allowing the humans to see, while overhead the Milky Way can be easily seen at all times.\nThe novel centers around John Redlantern, a \"newhair\" (teenager) who begins to resent the deep social and technological conservatism of Family. Killing a deadly leopard proves to be an epiphany which opens his eyes to the Malthusian catastrophe facing Family, which has grown too large for its tiny valley. Supported by pretty Tina Spikestree and John's cousins (the passive Gerry and the club footed pre-adolescent, thoughtful Jeff), John engages in a series of iconoclastic acts which lead to the \"breaking\" of Family. Exile of John and his teenaged followers is only the first of many ramifications, as John leads a messianic quest for a land \"over Cold Dark\" where Family can grow and thrive.\nThe novel is told in the first-person voice by various characters, and each short chapter is told from a different character's perspective. Linguistic drift has given the people of Eden unique nouns (\"police veekle\", \"rayed yoh\", and \"Jesus Juice\" instead of \"police vehicle\", \"radio\", and \"Jesus and the Jews\"). The adverb \"very\" has dropped from the language, and emphasis is created by reduplication (\"bad bad\" instead of \"very bad\"). Linguistic relativity has yet to set in, so that Family lacks words to describe much of their world (\"Cold Dark\" instead of \"high, dark mountain wreathed in glaciers\"). Beckett said he adopted the unsophisticated, childish language of the Edenites after realizing he had crafted a society in which \"the Eden settlers were a bunch of kids and two adults... .  There's no external adult world as a reference point\". With the two adults constantly speaking baby-talk to their children, pre-teens and teens never adopted more adult ways of speaking.\nBeckett intended the novel to be \"the Bible story...turned on its head\", one in which people are \"expelled to Eden\". He conceived the novel after realizing that much of the Old Testament consisted of \"small domestic stories elevated to a mythical level\", and he established the social norms, rituals, and myths of Family around similar stories.\nBeckett also wanted to explore themes about making hard choices. To think outside the box sometimes requires not only \"transgressive\" but extremely \"cruel\" behavior, he told Kirkus Reviews. The ramifications of John Redlantern's transgression, he noted, also has a wide number of unintended ramifications. The novel explores a socially and theologically conservative society's reaction to this transgression, which at first leads to a reactionary response. Only later does it lead to social upheaval in ways some characters predict (most notably Tina Spiketree's fears of patriarchy) but in ways no one can anticipate. Beckett said much of the latter part of the novel is about how positive, creative new ways of thinking can still harm people badly, and force people to make sacrifices they do not wish to make.\nDark Eden was author Chris Beckett's second novel.  Reviews were generally very positive in the United Kingdom. Stuart Kelly in The Guardian called it a \"superior piece of theologically nuanced science fiction\", although he noted that the novel drew a little heavily on Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker and Will Self's The Book of Dave. Author Paul Di Filippo, reviewing the book for Locus magazine, described the plot"

The start of the book begins with an eight-year-old orphan girl named Sophie lying in bed in an orphanage run by Mrs. Clonkers. She cannot sleep, and sees a strange sight in the street; a giant man, carrying a bag  and an odd trumpet. He sees Sophie, who tries to hide in bed, but the giant picks her up through the window. Then he runs quickly to a large cave, which he enters.\nWhen he sets Sophie down, she begins to plead for her life, believing that the giant will eat her. The giant laughs and explains that most giants do eat human beings (which he pronounces as \"human beans\"), and that the people's origins affect their taste. For example, people from Greece taste greasy while people from Panama taste of hats. The giant then says that he will not eat her as he is the Big Friendly Giant, or BFG for short.\nThe BFG explains that she must stay with him forever so that no one can know of his existence. He warns her of the dangers of leaving his cave as his nine neighbours are sure to eat her if they catch her. He also explains what he was doing with the trumpet and suitcase. He catches dreams, stores them in the cave, and then gives the good ones to children all around the world. He destroys the bad ones. The BFG then explains that he eats the only edible plant that will grow in the giants' homeland: snozzcumbers, which are disgusting striped cucumber-like vegetables with wart-like growths that taste like frog skins and rotten fish to Sophie and cockroaches and slime wanglers to the BFG.\nAnother giant called the Bloodbottler then storms in. Sophie hides in a snozzcumber and is nearly accidentally eaten by the Bloodbottler. Bloodbottler luckily spits her out and then leaves in disgust. When Sophie announces she is thirsty, the BFG treats her to a fizzy soda pop drink called \"frobscottle\" which causes noisy flatulence, which the BFG calls \"Whizzpopping\", because of the bubbles sinking downwards, rather than floating upwards.\nThe next morning, the BFG takes Sophie to Dream Country to catch more dreams, but is tormented by the man-eating giants along the way, notably by their leader the Fleshlumpeater, the largest and most fearsome of the giants.\nIn Dream Country, the BFG demonstrates his dream-catching skills to Sophie; but the BFG mistakenly captures a nightmare and uses it to start a fight among the other giants when Fleshlumpeater has a nightmare about a giant killer named Jack.\nSophie later persuades him to approach the Queen of England about imprisoning the other giants. To this end, she uses her knowledge of London to navigate the BFG to Buckingham Palace and the BFG creates a nightmare for the Queen which describes the man-eating giants and leaves Sophie in the Queen's bedroom to confirm it. Because the dream included the knowledge of Sophie's presence, the Queen believes her and speaks with the BFG.\nA fleet of helicopters then follows Sophie and the BFG to the giants' homeland where the giants are tied up as they sleep and the helicopters carry them back to London where they are imprisoned in a 500 feet (150\u00a0m) deep pit with sheer walls and a high safety fence. The BFG is lowered in to untie them. Untying Fleshlumpeater last, he explains why they are being imprisoned. Outraged, Fleshlumpeater roars that they will devour the BFG instead, but he is hoisted out to safety. The man-eating giants find themselves being only fed snozzcumbers. On one occasion though, there is an incident where three drunken men climb over the fence surrounding the pit, fall in, and are eaten by the giants. Meanwhile, the orphanage is closed down and sold to become a teacherage.\nAfterwards, a huge castle is built as the BFG's new house, with a little cottage next door for Sophie. While they are living happily in England, gifts come from the governments of every country ever targeted by the giants (notably England, Sweden, Arabia, India, Panama, Tibet, Jersey, Chile, and New Zealand). After Sophie teaches the BFG how to read and write proper English, he writes a book of their adventures identified as the novel itself\u2014under the name \"Roald Dahl\".\nSophie: The imaginative, creative and kind-hearted protagonist of the story who becomes a brave international heroine.

The novel has been used in numerous colleges and universities, in many cases for university-wide adoptions in \"common-book\" programs.

The novel fictionalizes Albert Einstein as a young scientist who is troubled by dreams as he works on his theory of relativity in 1905. The book consists of 30 chapters, each exploring one dream about time that Einstein had during this period. The framework of the book consists of a prelude, three interludes, and an epilogue. Einstein's friend, Michele Besso, appears in these sections. Each dream involves a conception of time. Some scenarios may involve exaggerations of true phenomena related to relativity, and some may be entirely fantastical. The book demonstrates the relationship each human being has to time, and thus spiritually affirms Einstein's theory of relativity.\nThe novel is sometimes cited as the source of the urban legend apocryphal \"universal force\" letter from Einstein to his daughter, Lieserl, but the novel does not contain the letter.\nLightman, Alan (1992).

As with many of the Discworld novels, the story takes place in Ankh-Morpork, a powerful city-state based on the historical and modern settings of various metropolises like London or New York City. The protagonist of the story is Moist von Lipwig, a skilled con artist who was to be hanged for his crimes, but saved at the last moment by the cunning and manipulative Patrician Havelock Vetinari, who has Moist's death on the scaffold faked.\nIn his office, Vetinari then presents Moist with two options: he may accept a job offer to become Postmaster of the city's rundown Postal Service or he may choose to walk out of the door and never hear from Vetinari again. As exiting through the door in question would lead to a fatal drop, Moist decides to accept the job.\nAfter a thwarted attempt at escape, Moist is brought to the Post Office by his parole officer Mr Pump, a golem. It turns out that the Post Office has not functioned for decades, and the building is full of undelivered mail, concealed under a layer of pigeon dung. Only two employees remain: the aged Junior Postman Tolliver Groat and his assistant Stanley Howler.\nMeanwhile, Vetinari is holding a meeting with the board executives of the Grand Trunk Company, a company that owns and operates a system of visual telegraph towers known as \"clacks\". He notes that since they have taken full control, the quality of service had gone down considerably. Despite unnerving most of the board, Vetinari fails to make headway, especially with its chairman, Reacher Gilt. It is rumored that, from his penthouse office in Tump Tower, Reacher Gilt plans to usurp Vetinari as Patrician.\nAs Moist attempts to revitalise the postal service, he discovers that over the few months before taking the job, a number of his predecessors have predeceased in the building within weeks of each other in unusual circumstances. He also discovers that the mail inside the building has taken on a life of its own, and is nearly suffocated as a result.\nMoist introduces postage stamps to Ankh-Morpork, hires golems to deliver the mail, and finds himself competing against the Grand Trunk Clacks line. He meets and falls in love with the chain-smoking, golem-rights activist, Adora Belle Dearheart, and the two begin a relationship by the end of the book. Dearheart is the daughter of the Clacks founder Robert Dearheart, though the company was taken away from her father and the other founders by tricky financial manoeuvring. She still has useful contacts amongst the clacks operators.\nThe unscrupulous Clacks chairman, Reacher Gilt, sets a banshee assassin (Mr Gryle) on the Postmaster, but only manages to burn down much of the Post Office building. The banshee dies when he is flipped onto the space-warping sorting machine. Lipwig makes an outrageous wager that he can deliver a message to Genua, 2000 miles from Ankh-Morpork, faster than the Grand Trunk can. \"The Smoking Gnu\", a group of clacks-crackers, sets up a plan to send 'the woodpecker' (a Discworld equivalent to a killer poke) into the clacks system that will destroy the machinery, halting the message that Lipwig will race against. Lipwig talks the Gnu out of it, wanting to leave the semaphore towers standing. Instead, Lipwig and the Gnu, using Trunk documents in Adora Belle's possession, intercept the message and replace it with a message from the dead which serves as a confession of guilt by the Trunk. This plan succeeds.\nGilt is soon arrested and finds himself in front of the Patrician, offered a similar choice to the one Moist faced in the beginning of the book: run the mint or exit the room.

The story begins with Rose and Dimitri traveling to meet the legendary guardian Arthur Schoenberg for Rose's Qualifier Exam. Once they arrive at the home of the Moroi family he protects, they discover a bloody massacre of the entire family and their guardians, including Arthur. Rose also discovers a silver stake, a magical device which Strigoi cannot touch, meaning the Strigoi must have had human assistance in their attack. The massacre puts the vampire community on high alert. After that, Dimitri takes Rose to meet a friend of his named Tasha Ozera, who is Christian's aunt. To keep the students at St. Vladimir's Academy safe, a ski trip to a lodge owned by a wealthy Moroi family is required right after Christmas.\nDuring the ski trip, panic sets in when news of another Strigoi attack on a royal Moroi family spreads, where one of the dead was Mia's mother. During her stay at the lodge, Rose talks to her mother and finds out that Tasha is not only a friend of Dimitri, but she also wants him to be her guardian, and even more astonishingly that she wants to have a relationship with him and as it seems Dimitri is all up for it; she also meets a royal Moroi named Adrian Ivashkov, who shows obvious interest in Rose, and later becomes friendly with Lissa after they both discover they are Spirit users. During Adrian's pool party, Mason, his friend Eddie, and Mia begin voicing their opinions about hunting Strigoi. After a heated argument with Dimitri, Rose tells Mason confidential information about the possible whereabouts of the Strigois' hideouts. Using Rose's information, Mia, Mason, and Eddie sneak out of the ski lodge and travel to Spokane, Washington, to hunt down the Strigoi themselves. Rose discovers their plan, and she and Christian run out to stop them.\nRose and Christian find the group and convince them to return to the lodge. However, they are ambushed by Strigoi led by Isaiah, who hold them captive for days, threatening to kill the young novices and convince either Christian or Mia to turn into Strigoi by killing one of their friends. Rose and Christian eventually come up with a plan to escape, and they all manage to get out of the house into the protection of the light, except Rose, who is left fighting Isaiah and his subordinate Elena. Mason's neck gets snapped, killing him instantly when he returns and attempted to help Rose. Rose then kills Isaiah and Elena by beheading them with a dull sword in rage from Mason's death, and then collapses into shock, just as Guardians arrive. Once back at St. Vladimir's, Rose receives two molnija marks for her Strigoi kills. Dimitri also tells her that he turned down Tasha's offer to become her guardian, admitting that his heart is with Rose and will never leave her, then he kisses her.\nVampire Academy\nRichelle Mead\nAmazon.com: Frostbite (Vampire Academy novel)\nNew York Times Children's Books Bestseller Lists, 09/03/2009\nRichelle Mead's Official Website \nOfficial Book Website Of Vampire Academy"

Rose, in shock over Mason's death, prepares with the rest of the novices for the Qualifying Exam, in which the novices protect the Moroi students from \"attacks\" by \"Strigoi\" (their Dhampir teachers). Rose is positive that she will be paired with Lissa, but instead is paired with Christian Ozera, while Eddie Castile (Mason's best friend) is paired with Lissa. Rose complains to her teachers, but ultimately resigns herself to guarding Christian. During the first attack on Christian, Rose sees Mason's ghost and freezes - and is accused of being a sore loser by her teachers. In a sudden twist, Christian is the only person who truly believes that Rose didn't screw up on purpose.\nMeanwhile, Rose overhears that Victor Dashkov's trial is coming soon - and that she and Lissa aren't going to be called to testify. She begs Dimitri to find a way to get them into the trial, and he promises to see what he can do. Adrian and Lissa are growing closer (in a teacher-student sense) while practicing their Spirit use, making Christian jealous. After Rose settles a fight between Lissa and Christian, she begins to sense changes in herself - mainly feelings of intense anger (even more than is usual). Christian is also approached by Jesse Zeklos to join a secret \"club\" he and Ralf have started, though Christian turns them down. Rose becomes suspicious, and tries to learn more about this club, which she later learns is called \"M\u00e2n\u0103\".\nAlthough Dimitri attempts to get Rose and Lissa into court to testify, it is ultimately Adrian who gains them entry. On the plane ride to Court, Rose is struck with a horrible migraine, but shakes it off as they arrive at Court; Dimitri and Alberta accompany Rose, Lissa, Christian, Eddie, and Adrian. Dimitri and Rose go to visit Victor in jail, who is as maddeningly pleasant as ever, and threatens to reveal what really happened between Dimitri and Rose the night he kidnapped Lissa. Dimitri threatens to have him killed in jail, but Victor taunts them with his knowledge. The day of the trial, Victor does reveal that Rose and Dimitri almost slept together, but everyone in the courtroom automatically believe this to be another one of Victor's lies. He is sent to prison by the court. Lissa meets with Queen Tatiana to discuss her future; she agrees to go to a college close to Court, and voices her opinion on Moroi fighting with Dhamphirs. Rose goes in to meet with Tatiana next - who insists that Rose stop sleeping with Adrian and call off their \"engagement\". Rose is stunned, and listens to Tatiana call her everything but a whore. Tatiana then reveals that she has been planning a marriage between Adrian and Lissa, and that they don't need to be carrying any of her \"emotional baggage\" around with them.\nRose shrugs off the queen's accusations and meets up with Lissa, lying to her about her conversation with the queen. Lissa takes Rose for a manicure, where Rose is treated by a young man, Ambrose, who turns out to be a Dhamphir and the queen's blood whore. He takes Lissa and Rose to a fortune teller, who gives Rose a rather boring reading. Dimitri finds them and agrees to have his fortune read. The fortune teller predicts that Dimitri will \"lose that which he treasures most\".\nOn the plane ride back to the Academy, Rose gets another horrible migraine, this time drawing the attention of Alberta and Dimitri. When they are forced to make an unscheduled stop at a human airport to refuel during a snow storm, Rose's migraine becomes much worse, and when she steps off the plane, she sees the ghosts of Lissa's parents and brother, along with many others. When she comes to, she is in the infirmary back at the Academy. Rose is finally forced to come clean about seeing Mason's ghost, and she is ordered to see a counselor. Her \"guardian time\" with Christian is also limited. While back at school, her temper still increases, though she does successfully defeat Dimitri as a \"Strigoi\" while guarding Christian. Lissa is approached by Jesse and Ralf to join M\u00e2n\u0103, and she accepts their invitation as a chance to spy on them, without Rose's knowing. Lissa is led into the woods and attacked by Jesse and the other magic users. Rose senses something is terribly wrong and runs to Lissa's aid. She beats Lissa's torturers \u2013 fellow students \u2014 and Lissa tortures Jesse using Spirit. Rose realizes that whenever Lissa uses Spirit, dark emotions fill Lissa \u2014 which caused her to cut herself in the first book \u2014 and"

Koontz's attempt at a straightforward horror novel, it was originally released as Shadow Fires under the pseudonym Leigh Nichols, and tells the story of a young woman who, in the process of getting a divorce from her husband of seven years, becomes a widow after a traffic accident. However, her husband's body soon disappears from the morgue, and other bodies are discovered, murdered horribly. The woman, Rachael, and her significant other, Ben Shadway, find themselves learning a secret too terrible for anyone to believe, followed by forces who wish to silence and kill them.",

The protagonist of the story is a woman who is in the process of divorcing her abusive husband Eric, an intense scientist at a bio-research company, when he is killed in a traffic accident.\nAs it turns out, the husband was doing research into immortality, due to an obsession with cheating death stemming from sexual abuse he suffered as a child and the fear that his abuser is waiting for him in Hell. In fact, he experimented on himself using an untested serum designed to grant incredible regenerative abilities.\nThe husband wakes up in the morgue, but his \"immortality\" turns out to be flawed; it cannot properly repair brain damage, as the \"mind\" is made of electrical signals and not just flesh and protein. The trauma from the traffic accident has resulted in him suffering constant pain and a lack of mental clarity. The husband, now an unstoppable killing machine, proceeds to stalk his wife across the country while slowly descending into madness and the return from death causing him to mutate at a rapid pace.\nRachael and her boyfriend Ben Shadway track the reanimated Eric to his secret country hideaway in the hope of killing him before he can regenerate to a level where he would be able to find and kill Rachael. However, Eric outwits them and manages to hide in the trunk of Rachael's car after overhearing her and Ben in conversation discussing their plan to split up and meet in Las Vegas.\nAs Rachael Leben unwittingly transports Eric toward Las Vegas, she stops off along the way and witnesses Eric emerge from the trunk of her car, now hideously transformed into some kind of indescribable mutant and rapidly mutating. A chase ensues into the desert, but Rachael manages to escape from Eric's clutches while he's feeding on a den of rattlesnakes and finds her way back to her car, setting off again toward Vegas. Some time later Eric kills and eats the driver of a car then rapes, kills, and devours the female passenger before he too sets off to Vegas. Ben Shadway is also being chased by federal agent Anson Sharp, who harbours a 20-year-old grudge against Shadway after the two served in Vietnam together and Shadway exposed Sharp's corruption and illegal smuggling activities, culminating in Sharp being dishonourably discharged from the US army. Partners in Eric Leben's bio-research company are also on the tail of Shadway and Rachael Leben to try to prevent them from exposing the top-secret project that the company was working on to the media but are stopped by Sharp's forces. Sharp seeks to kill them both, to keep Project Wildcard secret and get revenge on Ben.\nAfter a lengthy pursuit across Nevada to Las Vegas, the couple have their final confrontation with Eric at Ben's hotel. Eric's mutation finally stabilizes into a seemingly unstoppable and unrecognizable insectoid form incapable of being slain by the firearms they have. Thinking quickly they pour gasoline on Eric and set him on fire. Consumed by fire, the accelerated metabolism in Eric's mutated body devours itself in an attempt to regenerate and mutate further, reducing his body to ooze and finally killing the genetic abomination but not before Eric's shattered consciousness finally accepts death. Sharp attempts to kill them but one of his own men who realizes how insane Sharp had become shoots Sharp in the head and kills him. With both their enemies dead, Rachael and Ben finally prepare to get married as well as break the story to the press.\nShadow Fires Book Review"

The novel's characters and many elements of its plot are loosely based on actual people and events from Tombstone, Arizona during the same time period, including Wyatt Earp and the Gunfight at the O.K.

When violence threatens the frontier boomtown of Warlock, a Citizens' Committee determines to take action against criminal cowboys and cattle rustlers. A gunslinger named Clay Blaisedell, who has achieved considerable renown in Texas, is hired as town marshal to keep the peace. He is followed to Warlock by his close friend Tom Morgan, a gambler and saloon owner with a sour reputation, and Kate Dollar, a former prostitute bent on vengeance. Though Blaisedell at first manages to assert his authority with his stolid demeanor and expert gunmanship, Abe McQuown and his troublesome gang of cowboys seek to antagonize him.\nOne of McQuown's former associates, John \"Bud\" Gannon, hopes to repent for the horrors of his past by becoming a deputy sheriff in Warlock, while his younger brother Billy continues to ride with McQuown. Bud's decision unsettles both the gang and the town's citizens, and he is forced to confront suspicion about his loyalties from both sides while trying to maintain his official neutrality. When Blaisedell declares several of McQuown's company banned from Warlock, the outlaws disobey the posting and ride into town. Morgan saves Blaisedell from an ambush in the ensuing shootout, and three of the outlaws, including Billy Gannon, are killed. Much of the town expects Bud to retaliate against Blaisedell out of respect for his brother, but the deputy remains impartial. Anticipating the ferocity of rumor that will inevitably surround accounts of the gunfight and wanting to avoid the distrust and ressentiment of the town, Blaisedell turns himself in for trial in neighboring Bright's City on the charge of murder.\nMeanwhile, employees of the local silver mines go on strike, demanding better pay and a new boss. Doctor Wagner, the town physician, is the miners' staunchest advocate, but implores them to organize a union and negotiate peacefully rather than resort to mob violence and sabotage. At the same time, the Citizens' Committee tries to avert open conflict by formally requesting Warlock's incorporation as the seat of a new county, which would permit them to hire their own full-time sheriff. They are discouraged by lengthy delays and the general reluctance of officials in Bright's City to hear their pleas, including the commander of the resident army detachment, General Peach, a decorated veteran of the Apache Wars whose senility borders on complete insanity. As tensions mount and rumors swirl, the concepts of morality and justice in the legal no-man's-land become ever more ambiguous.\nBlaisedell is soon acquitted of murder but resigns his position as town marshal and begins dealing faro at Morgan's saloon. Kate Dollar takes an interest in Bud Gannon, seeking to use him to enact her retribution upon Blaisedell and Morgan for orchestrating the murder of her fianc\u00e9 back in Texas.\nHall's most famous novel, Warlock was a finalist for the 1958 Pulitzer Prize, and has since been hailed as a classic of American West literature. Professor of English at the University of California, Irvine Michelle Latiolais described Warlock as belonging to the \"pantheon of western masterpieces\" alongside Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian and John Williams's Butcher's Crossing.\nWriters Thomas Pynchon and Richard Fari\u00f1a were especially fond of the novel, even dedicating what Pynchon called a \"micro-cult\" to it while students at Cornell University. Pynchon praised it for restoring \"to the myth of Tombstone its full, mortal, blooded humanity\", and for showing \"that what is called society, with its law and order, is as frail, as precarious, as flesh and can be snuffed out and assimilated into the desert as easily as a corpse can. It is the deep sensitivity to abysses that makes Warlock one of our best American novels.\" Novelist Robert Stone  was also reportedly a fan.\nPictorial History of the Wild West by James D.

Warlock is a sequel to River God that details the later life of Taita 40 years on from the death of Lostris. Taita is no longer a slave but a powerful warlock with great fame throughout Egypt and the surrounding nations, and has become the most influential man in Egypt through his close connection to the Pharaoh Tamose. The story begins with Pharaoh Tamose, accompanied by his most trusted companion, Lord Naja, marching towards the Hyksos main camp and planning a surprise attack from the rear. Lord Naja, however, has deviously tricked Pharaoh, for he is of Hyksos blood, and kills Pharaoh Tamose. However no one sees this tragedy, and Naja convinces the army of Pharaoh that he has been slain by the Hyksos and orders the army to retreat back to Thebes. When Naja arrives at Thebes, he cunningly sways the council members to appoint him as Regent, successfully obtaining power of the Upper Kingdom. Meanwhile, Taita takes a 14-year-old Nefer Memnon, Tamose's only surviving son from the Yellow Flower plague, into the desert wilderness to hone his mind and skills and to capture his godbird in order to prove his divine favor. Just after Nefer was born, years prior to these events, during his life in the desert as a hermit, Taita was visited in a dream by the former Queen Lostris, and returned to Thebes to be appointed as Nefer Seti's tutor, who is now next in line for the throne.\nTaita and Nefer fail to capture the godbird on two occasions, with their last incident revealing dire omens about Tamose's death and a dire threat to Nefer's life in the form of Tamose's unknown murderer. The two try to flee towards the Red Sea to escape the threat, but are found by Egyptian scouts sent by Naja, and return to Thebes. During the return, Nefer is crowned as Pharaoh Nefer Seti but is not of majority age nor ordained by the gods (either by capturing the godbird falcon or passing the trial of the Red Road), and hence must be placed under the protection and care of his Regent, Lord Naja.\nAs the story develops, Taita's talents are spotted by Naja and he is appointed as his personal advisor. Naja then reveals to Taita that he is no longer to be Nefer's tutor and is separated from him indefinitely. Taita is aware of Naja's cruel intentions and the truth behind Pharaoh's death, however he does not reveal this to Naja, and instead uses his influence of him to gain some small control. Nefer's two sisters, Heseret and Merykara are force-wedded to Naja and become his wives, placing him next in line, after Nefer, through marriage. After complications arise, Naja confides in Taita for advice on how to restore peace between the two kingdoms. Taits suggests a treaty, and is sent to King Apepi, the Hyksos leader, to require that he attends a meeting between the two leaders. After a long debate which lasts many days, a treaty is agreed and both leaders sign it, restoring peace throughout the land. However, Apepi is killed not long after and Trok, who was Apepi's general, and is also Naja's cousin and co-conspirator, takes the role of Pharaoh of the Lower Kingdom. All of Apepi's children die as well, except Princess Mintaka, whom Apepi betrothed to Nefer Seti to reinforce the peace treaty.\nThe two False Pharaohs join forces and begin an expedition to conquer more land and extend their kingdom. The co-Pharaohs' plans result in a sudden rise in military activity and levees of taxes, as well as harsher treatment of those who did not readily show their support of them, cause growing dissent and rebellion. Taita, using his vast knowledge and cunning, rescues Mintaka from Trok and reunites her with Nefer Seti, with whom she has fallen in love. The three, with loyal followers such as Nefer's childhood friend Meren Cambyses and a few others, begin to build up their own army in Gallalla over the next years, after Taita has a well constructed in the dead city. During these years Nefer's leadership and capability begins to flourish, and his fledgling forces complete successful missions against the false pharaohs.\nNefer rescues his youngest sister, Merykara, who immediately falls in love with Meren. However Heseret has fallen in love with Naja, whom she was forced to marry, and is convinced he is the one true ruler of Egypt. When Naja and Trok are both slain in battles against Nefer's forces, by his efforts and that of his companions, Heseret becomes delusional and kills her sister when she is captured along with Mintaka. She escapes into the desert, determined to search for her dead husband, but is caught by Nefer and punished for killing their sister. Nefer hands her over to Meren and he kills her as justice for killing"

The hope for the survival of the human race is a spaceship called the Willflower, which will take a small number of the world's best minds on a journey to colonize another planet. Eddie O'Hare, the protagonist, is not one of them. He is deep in debt due to his computer having mysteriously stolen several million dollars online, then sending it to an unknown location.

Colony was the first novel written by Rob Grant outside the Red Dwarf series. First published in 2000 by Viking Press in the United Kingdom it stays within the comedy, science fiction genre. The narrative is set on a spaceship sent on a voyage to colonise another planet, since Earth has been rendered uninhabitable. The mission is set to take numerous generations. Ten generations into the voyage, however, the crew's mental abilities have all been severely reduced, setting the events of the novel in motion.\nEddie O'Hare\nAn accountant posing as a community planner and, a few generations later, mistaken for a doctor and resurrected in an egg-like robot suit with nerve endings incorrectly connected (to the extent that the nerves controlling his new body's right hand should control a muscle in his anus). He believes himself to be the unluckiest man ever (and in the words of the novel: \"bluntly, he's got a damn point\"). Despite the contempt with which he is regarded, the rest of the crew come to subconsciously see him as a leader.\nPaolo San Pablos\nA hitman with a penchant for pink socks. A homicidal maniac, allegedly known to resort to spree murder as an anti-boredom device, he stowed away on the Willflower to kill Eddie as part of a contract, but was caught and put in suspended animation before he was revived. The revival procedure caused him to go insane, brutally disembowelling several people before the ship neutralises him.\nBernadette Oslo\nA member of the Willflower's crew; although her precise role on the ship is unclear, her nagging familiarity to Eddie, coupled with his asexual fondness for her, suggests that she may be his own descendant.\nFather Lewis\nThe ship's priest, although, by his own admission, his career is difficult due to his atheism (jobs are inherited, preventing him from changing roles). A fan of pornography, he possesses several video tapes of the women's shower room. He has installed a network of cameras throughout the ship, partly to gain more pornographic material but also to spy on people. He is not above blackmailing people with these images. Towards the end of the novel, he escapes the Willflower in the one remaining functional escape pod, taking the ship's prostitutes with him.\nStyx\nClones of the original security chief. Incredibly stupid, mainly due to the mental deterioration involved in every new batch of drones (they are described in the blurb as \"having the mental agility of pond life\"), most people simply treat the drones as equipment, with Eddie being the sole exception. Each Styx drone has a letter branded on his forehead and a name beginning with this letter to distinguish between them. The Styx drones are dangerously enthusiastic about their jobs, with one drone even accidentally killing himself by firing his laser rifle at a door on the maximum power setting at point blank range.\nTrinity Peck\nThe Willflower's science officer, who unfortunately, is in fact a religious fanatic who reacts to danger by beating herself with a whip while naked to punish herself for not noticing the problem earlier. She regards Eddie as an agent of the Devil.\nCaptain Gwent\nA spotty teenager who names planets after bodily functions and parts (specifically, \"Thrrrppp\", \"Penis\", \"Panties\", and \"Jockstrap\") and appears totally unconcerned about the fact that he is meant to be in charge of the mission (his father died under unspecified circumstances shortly before Eddie's revival). He is totally incompetent as a leader, but nobody seems to try to remove him from power, mainly because jobs are inherited and nobody knows who is meant to take the captain's place in this situation.\nCaptain Berwick Gwent\nThe original captain of the mission. Refers to himself as \"Community Director\", speaks ridiculously loudly and makes \"jokes\" in Latin. In terms of age, he is described as either \"a well preserved sixty or a gone to seed forty with inadequate access to hair dye\".\nAmalgam Willard-Walters aka The Professors\nTwo bitter rivals whose minds have been merged into one body. They have been put in cryogenic storage, as they have been constantly arguing and attempting to commit suicide.\nReceived initial very well by the SciFi buying public the novel continued to sell strongly into following years. By March 2002 it had sold more than 22,500 copies.\nCowie, Jonathan (2002). \"UK book publishing industry to take SF seriously...(?)\". concatenation.org.

The story starts on Earth in the future. Global warming and overpopulation has caused an imminent apocalypse. The hope for the survival of the human race is a spaceship called the Willflower, which will take a small number of the world's best minds on a journey to colonize another planet. Eddie O'Hare, the protagonist, is not one of them. He is deep in debt due to his computer having mysteriously stolen several million dollars online, then sending it to an unknown location. He decides to gamble what money he has left in the hope of getting enough to pay back the debts. On his way to the casino, he meets a pink-socked assassin whom he fears may have been sent to kill him. Fortunately, it seems Eddie is not the man's current target.\nWhen gambling the last of his money, Eddie wins \u2014 thanks to mimicking the gambling decisions of a man who looks uncannily like himself \u2014 but the casino closes down after losing all its money to the other man. Eddie discovers that this man, Charles Perry Gordon, is due to leave on the Willflower but doesn't want to go now that he was won such a vast fortune. Ramifications for the rest of his family mean Gordon cannot refuse to leave, so he offers Eddie his onboard credentials to go in his place. Eddie successfully smuggles himself onto the ship. As Gordon's job is the community planner, Eddie reads the plans to learn more about his job and discovers that the man he is replacing has enforced a fascist, totalitarian system: crew members are paired for life before they are even born, and jobs \u2014 even unpleasant ones such as prostitution \u2014 are inherited. However, shortly after the ship sets off he is murdered by an unknown assailant.\nThe story then jumps forward several generations. Eddie is revived as a cyborg with only his head and spinal column remaining of his original body, and trapped forever in a jar of green slime. (Even worse, the nerve endings are incorrectly wired, so that, for example, he moves his right arm when trying to move his left foot.) He finds himself on a ship full of idiots and that is something wrong with the ship; all but one of its engines are gone and it has only 20% of its maneuvering thrusters. The ship needs to land soon, but only three planets are available: Thrrrppp, which is the most habitable but with no way for the ship to enter orbit; Penis, which the ship has a 50% chance of docking with but is covered in volcanoes; and Panties, which is totally hostile but has a 90% chance of docking. As the only intelligent life form on board it is up to him to find out what is happening.\nAs he explores the ship, he meets more of the ship's mentally diminished crew, none of whom have even the slightest ability to perform their jobs. He is puzzled by this as well as the fact that the ship, which has been shown to be able to self-repair if it takes damage, has not done so. The ship is also on a collision course with a massive gas giant that does not appear on the radar system. Eddie decides to cause the nuclear-powered escape pod to self-destruct in the hope that the explosion will force the ship towards planet Thrrrppp. This fails when the less-than-moral priest steals the pod \u2014 accompanied by some of the ship's prostitutes to help him 'rebuild' human society \u2014 and destroys the remaining engines in the process.\nEddie encounters the assassin from the beginning of the novel, who was revived in another survival suit but driven completely insane by the process, and is now a homicidal maniac. Before he can harm Eddie, however, the ship kills him. It then talks to Eddie and reveals what has been happening. Its internal self-repair systems, it transpires, were also capable of self-modification, eventually becoming self-aware. Realizing the madness that the original community plans had instigated, it allowed the crew members to become illiterate to erase all memory of the old system. It has also gained the ability to time travel into the past, where it can affect electronics, but not take a physical form. The ship had selected Eddie to take charge of the crew as he was the only person with sufficiently low self-esteem to survive the cybernetic revival system; the sheer horror of the suit would have driven anyone else insane, but Eddie expected so little out of life that he actually came through the process as a better person. The ship caused Eddie's computer to steal the money (prompting the series of events that caused Eddie to arrive on the ship). The Willflower then repairs itself and flies to the planet Thrrrppp.\nEddie O'Hare\nAn accountant posing as a community planner and, a few"

It explores the central themes of loss, guilt, and mental illness. It takes place over three timelines: the present where Matt is writing; the past where Simon is alive; and the decade since Simon died. The novel was first published in the UK on 9 May 2013, by HarperCollins Publishers. It was originally published in the United States by St. Martin's Press under the title Where the Moon Isn't.

Nathan Filer, who grew up in Bristol, first had the idea for his first novel, The Shock of the Fall, when he was training to be a mental health nurse in 2002. The idea of the central character of Matthew arrived in his head as he was walking home after a shift on an acute psychiatric ward. In 2004 Filer completed his degree in mental health nursing, and in 2007 moved into academia as a research assistant \u2014 where he looked into treatments for depression. This experience has resulted in Filer having met many patients and their family, saying this aided his book and his work in nursing. After having worked on the novel for seven years, Filer decided in 2009 to study a creative writing MA and make the novel a priority. The book was eventually published on 9 May 2013, after it was subject to an 11-way auction and sold to HarperCollins for a six-figure sum.\nThe novel starts with Matt reciting recollections from his childhood, where he blatantly states that he is not a nice person and has not dealt with pain since scraping his knee at the age of nine. This episode happened when he and his brother Simon went camping with their parents at Ocean Grove Holiday Park in Dorset. After scraping his knee, Simon carries Matt back to where they are staying. Shortly after, Simon, who has Down syndrome and several other medical conditions, is found dead.\nIn the present, Matt is being treated at the Hope Road Day Centre mental hospital. He was committed there by his parents, Richard and Susan, after his grandmother found him attempting to make a giant ant farm in his flat, which a hallucination of Simon told him to do. Matt finds his experience at the ward repetitive, and often complains about the rigid schedule. One of Matt's therapists asks him to perform a genogram \u2013 which eventually makes him remember what happened to Simon by writing about the night he died. It is revealed that Simon's death was the result of a harmless prank gone wrong, where Simon accidentally fell off of a short cliff.\nAfter Simon's parents and the ward doctor, Edward Clement, discuss the progress Matt has made at the ward, he is discharged. The novel ends with Matt awaiting his release, stating that the story does not have an end, as he is still living it.\nMatthew Homes \u2014 main protagonist and narrator of the novel, diagnosed with schizophrenia at 17.\nSimon Homes \u2014 Matthew's older brother with Down syndrome, who died when Matthew was nine.\nRichard Homes \u2014 Matthew and Simon's father.\nSusan Homes \u2014 Matthew and Simon's Mother.\nNanny Noo \u2014 Matthew's grandmother, and one of the main characters of the novel, who often helps him out.\nJacob Greening \u2014 Matthew's best and only friend, as well as former flatmate.\n\nThe novel was praised by The Guardian as \"a gripping and exhilarating read\", the narrator's voice being \"dazzlingly rendered\". British Journal of Psychiatry noted that readers who are psychiatrists hoping to find themselves portrayed within the work would be disappointed, as they are \"mentioned less than a handful of times throughout\". However, they praise Filer's \"very talented storytelling\" and \"fine description of psychiatry\".\nLondon Review of Books praises Filer's skillful interweaving of time frames and his \"impressive feat of storytelling\". It criticizes that the techniques of suspense used works against the story itself, it \"reinforces the distinction between the narrator's point of view and the readers\". Additionally, the lack of ambiguity here makes the book \"fundamentally out of sympathy with its narrator\".\nThe Telegraph praises the novel as bittersweet and wonderfully etched, noting that it is \"an unsettling read but a perceptive and moving one\".\nThe novel won the Costa Book of the Year and the Costa First Novel Award in 2013, with chairman of the judges Rose Tremain saying it was \"exceptionally moving without being sentimental\" and \"astonishingly sure-footed\" for a first novel. Additionally, the novel was awarded the Betty Trask Prize of \u00a310,000 in 2014.\nIn 2014 the novel was awarded Specsavers Popular Fiction Book of the Year by Specsavers National Book Award as well as the Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for Best First Novel.\nThe novel also made the Desmond Elliott Prize longlist in 2014.\nBosman, Julie (10 February 2014). \"After Prize, Novel Gets 2nd Chance in the U.S.\" The New York Times.

It is the fourth of his five \"Christmas Books\", coming after The Cricket on the Hearth and followed by The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain. The setting is an English village that stands on the site of an historic battle. Some characters refer to the battle as a metaphor for the struggles of life, hence the title. Battle is the only one of the five Christmas Books that has no supernatural or explicitly religious elements. (One scene takes place at Christmas time, but it is not the final scene.) The story bears some resemblance to The Cricket on the Hearth in two respects: it has a non-urban setting, and it is resolved with a romantic twist. ...",

Two sisters, Grace and Marion, live happily in an English village with their two servants, Clemency Newcome and Ben Britain, and their good-natured widower father Dr Jeddler. Dr Jeddler is a man whose philosophy is to treat life as a farce. Marion, the younger sister, is betrothed to Alfred Heathfield, Jeddler's ward who is leaving the village to complete his studies. He entrusts Marion to Grace's care and makes a promise to return to win Marion's hand.\nMichael Warden, a libertine who is about to leave the country, is thought by the solicitors Snitchey and Craggs to be about to seduce the younger sister into an elopement. Clemency spies Marion one night in her clandestine rendezvous with Warden. On the day that Alfred is to return, however, it is discovered that Marion has run off. Her supposed elopement causes much grief to both her father and her sister.\nSix years pass. Clemency is now married to Britain and the two have set up a tavern in the village. After nursing heartbreak, Alfred marries Grace instead of Marion and she bears him a daughter, also called Marion. On the birthday of Marion, Grace confides to Alfred that Marion has made a promise to explain her so-called \"elopement\" in person. Marion indeed appears that evening by sunset and explains her disappearance to the parties involved. It turns out that Marion has not \"eloped\" but has instead been living at her aunt Martha's place so as to allow Alfred to fall in love with Grace. Tears are shed and happiness and forgiveness reign as the missing sister is reunited with the rest. Warden also returns, and, forgiven by Dr Jeddler, marries Marion.\nAn adaptation of The Battle of Life by Albert Richard Smith was produced with success at the Surrey Theatre in 1846.\nThe Battle of Life at Internet Archive.\n The Battle of Life at Project Gutenberg\n The Battle of Life public domain audiobook at LibriVox\nThe Battle of Life - Searchable HTML version.\nThe Battle of Life - Easy to read HTML version."

Dickens began writing the book around 17 October 1845 and finished it by 1 December. Like all of Dickens's Christmas books, it was published in book form, not as a serial. Dickens described the novel as \"quiet and domestic [...] innocent and pretty.\" It is subdivided into chapters called \"Chirps\", similar to the \"Quarters\" of The Chimes or the \"Staves\" of A Christmas Carol. ...",

In July 1845, Dickens contemplated forming a periodical focusing on the concerns of the home. It was to be called The Cricket, but the plan fell through, and he transformed his idea into a Christmas book in which he abandoned social criticism, current events, and topical themes in favour of simple fantasy and a domestic setting for his hero's redemption, though some have criticised this notion. The book was released on 20 December 1845 (the title page read \"1846\") and sold briskly into the New Year. Seventeen stage productions opened during the Christmas season 1845 with one production receiving Dickens's approval and opening on the same day as the book's release. Dickens read the tale four times in public performance. It has been dramatised in numerous languages and for years was more popular on stage than A Christmas Carol. Cricket is less explicitly Christian than some of Dickens's other Christmas books, and it has been criticised for its sentimentality, but contemporary readers were attracted to its depiction of the Victorian ideal of the happy home.\nJohn Peerybingle, a carrier, lives with his young wife Dot, their baby boy and their nanny Tilly Slowboy. A cricket chirps on the hearth and acts as a guardian angel to the family. One day a mysterious elderly stranger comes to visit and takes up lodging at Peerybingle's house for a few days.\nThe life of the Peerybingles intersects with that of Caleb Plummer, a poor toymaker employed by the miser Mr. Tackleton. Caleb has a blind daughter Bertha, and a son Edward, who travelled to South America and is thought to be dead.\nThe miser Tackleton is now on the eve of marrying Edward's sweetheart, May, but she does not love Tackleton. Tackleton tells John Peerybingle that his wife Dot has cheated on him, and shows him a clandestine scene in which Dot embraces the mysterious lodger; the latter, who is in disguise, is actually a much younger man than he seems. John is cut to the heart over this as he loves his wife dearly, but decides after some deliberations to relieve his wife of their marriage contract.\nIn the end, the mysterious lodger is revealed to be none other than Edward who has returned home in disguise. Dot shows that she has indeed been faithful to John. Edward marries May hours before she is scheduled to marry Tackleton. However, Tackleton's heart is melted by the festive cheer (in a manner reminiscent of Ebenezer Scrooge), and he surrenders May to her true love.\nJohn Peerybingle, a carrier; a lumbering, slow, honest man\nMrs. Mary Peerybingle, (\"Dot\"), John Peerybingle's wife\nCaleb Plummer, a poor old toymaker in the employ of Tackleton\nBertha Plummer, the blind daughter of Caleb Plummer\nEdward Plummer, the son of Caleb Plummer\nTackleton (called \"Gruff and Tackleton\"), a stern, ill-natured, sarcastic toy merchant\nMay Fielding, a friend to Mrs. Peerybingle\nMrs. Fielding, her mother; a little, peevish, querulous old lady\nTilly Slowboy, a great clumsy girl; Mrs. Peerybingle's nursemaid\nthe baby, child of Dot and John, treated as an object throughout the story.\nThe book was a huge commercial success, quickly going through two editions. Reviews were favourable, but not all so. In an unsigned piece in The Times the reviewer opined, \"We owe it to literature to protest against this last production of Mr. Dickens [...] Shades of Fielding and Scott! Is it for such jargon as this that we have given your throne to one who cannot estimate his eminence?\" However, William Makepeace Thackeray enjoyed the book immensely: \"To us, it appears it is a good Christmas book, illuminated with extra gas, crammed with extra bonbons, French plums and sweetness [...] This story is no more a real story than Peerybingle is a real name!\"\nDickens's portrayal of the blind girl Bertha is significant. Victorians believed disabilities were inherited, and thus it was not socially acceptable for the blind to marry (although they often did in reality). In fictional courtship plots, the blind were often used to build tension since it was assumed they must be kept from marrying. The fictional portrayal of Bertha is similar to Dickens's description in American Notes (1842) of the deaf and blind girl Laura Bridgman, whom he saw on a visit to the Perkins Institution for the Blind in Boston, Massachusetts.\nModern scholars have given the story little attention, but Andrew Sangers has argued it contains similarities to Shakespeare's comedies and should be seen \"both as a significant indication of the tastes of the 1840s and of Dickens himself.\"\nVladimir Lenin"

Of the non-fiction, he pans the essay by Damon Kinght that \"asks the question, 'What is science fiction?' [and] tests his definition against a list of famous stories and novels to see if his theory works. It doesn't, and neither does his essay.\" He finds the pieces by Card and Richard Grant \"[m]ost provocative, though, ... fascinating [in] that, while they seem to come from opposite ends of a spectrum, they both ... agree that the reader's subjective experience is paramount - the opinions of literature professors be damned.\"\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Russell Letson in Locus no. 365, June 1991, John C.

Selected SF authors, in short essays, bemoan the state of the genre, yet these stories and novellas (and even a poem or two) give the lie to any pessimism.\" She calls it \"Essential reading for anyone who enjoys science fiction, this collection goes a long way toward demonstrating that, now and then, those who engage in the sometimes thankless task of bestowing writing awards really do know how to pick winners.\" The pieces by Willis, Sheffield and Cady are singled out for particular comment, as are the tributes to Davidson, del Rey and Oliver.\nCarl Hays in Booklist notes that \"Nebula award winners perennially represent the best state-of-the-art imaginative fiction, and 1994's are not exceptions. Editor Sargent provides a superlative showcase for the recipients and several runners-up by interspersing among them biographical sketches, overviews of sf films and poetry, and short essays by sf veterans appraising the year's creative highlights.\" He observes that \"[a]lthough several of the pieces collected here appear in other year's-best anthologies, the Nebula gathering is, like its predecessors, an indispensable representation of the genre's best recent writing and a reliable indicator of its leading edge.\" He singles out the pieces by Haldeman, Sheffield and Cady for particular comment, as well as the excerpt from Robinson's novel.\nBarbara Hawkins, assessing the book for younger readers in School Library Journal, calls it a \"well-crafted collection\" in which a \"variety of styles and themes awaits readers,\" summing it up as \"[a]ll told, a bountiful excursion for Y[oung] A[dult] minds.\" She singles out the Haldeman, Cady, Sheffield and Chambers pieces for comment.\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Gary K. Wolfe in Locus no. 411, April 1995 and Gary Reger in The New York Review of Science Fiction, September 1995.\nThe book placed tenth in the 1996 Locus Poll Award for Best Anthology.\nNebula Awards 29 title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\nSimson, Maria.
