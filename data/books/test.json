The story, divided into short, numbered \"episodes\" rather than chapters, is presented as a \"story about Nikola Tesla\" recounted by Richard Feynman to a group of other Manhattan Project scientists in the wake of World War II. It involves the efforts of a similar think-tank, the Kamikaze Group, to uncover the secret of a rumored \"super-weapon\" Tesla had developed before his death, one supposedly responsible for the mysterious Tunguska explosion of 1908. Feynman makes no claims for the tale's veracity, a caution warranted at the end of the book when his informant is revealed to have been pulp writer L. Ron Hubbard, a participant in the novel's events portrayed as a self-promoting, delusional narcissist.\nMalmont bases the Kamikaze Group on the trio of science fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein, L. Sprague de Camp and Isaac Asimov, who in actual history spent most of the war doing aeronautical engineering research for the U.S. Navy  at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard's Naval Air Experimental Station. He portrays them as engaged in a joint project there to develop super-scientific weapons to help the U.S. win the war, though in reality they worked separately on technical improvements to airplanes and weapons systems. Heinlein leads the fictional project, which also draws on the assistance of other pulp authors of his acquaintance, most notably Hubbard, Walter B. Gibson, and Lester Dent, with cameo roles by John W. Campbell, Norvell Page, Hugh B. Cave, Frederik Pohl, Cleve Cartmill, Kurt Vonnegut, Judith Merril, and Ray Bradbury. Additional historical luminaries such as Jack Parsons, Albert Einstein and Jimmy Stewart also put in appearances.\nAfter Tesla's mysterious death the military raids his apartment and confiscates his papers, spurred by apparent German interest in his discoveries. Heinlein is charged with investigating the supposed \"wonder weapon\" referred to in the papers. Together with de Camp, Asimov, Hubbard and Gibson he explores a sub-basement of the Empire State Building where Tesla had left some of his equipment, and is almost trapped there by an unknown adversary. Further inquiries take the core group to the former site of Wardenclyffe Tower, the inventor's wireless transmission facility in Shoreham, New York, which apparently doubled as the \"sending\" component of the weapon. Afterwards Hubbard is sent first to the Aleutian Islands and then the South Pacific to retrieve the receiver, while Asimov is put in charge of securing the capacitors needed to make the transmitter work.\nMeanwhile, government goons are investigating the group itself, alarmed by the publication of Cartmill's story \"Deadline,\" with its all-too accurate description of a nuclear weapon similar to that being developed by the Manhattan Project. Their brutal interrogation of Heinlein is interrupted by a deadly phone call via which they are somehow electrocuted in the same fashion as Tesla. Matters come to a head as the Kamikaze Group seemingly makes good a promise to \"make a ship disappear\" (a nod to the \"Philadelphia Experiment\" urban legend), while Heinlein, convinced that time is running out, works with Tesla's ex-assistant at a duplicate of Wardencyffe Tower to make the wonder weapon functional. Once it is activated the assistant reveals himself as the group's prime adversary, and nearly succeeds in killing the group members before falling to his death in the pits beneath the tower.\nAfter the villain's defeat the military shuts down the Kamikaze Group. Heinlein is disheartened to discover that his group was conceived and regarded as a mere blind to distract the Axis powers from the U.S.'s real super weapon effort\u2014the Manhattan Project. His assertions of the reality of Tesla's weapon fall on deaf ears.\nMuch later, Hubbard, returning to the U.S. after the war, learns what has become of his former compatriots, encounters Feynman, and tells him the story.\nMichael Dirda, writing for The Washington Post, feels the novel \"never quite lives up to its title. It opens slowly, breaks up its narrative among too many different characters and plot lines, and is unpersuasively framed as a story related by physicist Richard Feynman. Frequent comic episodes, some verging on slapstick, don't wholly come off. Nor are the big scenes - involving secret tunnels underneath the Empire State Building or the final showdown at Tesla's Tower - altogether fresh. I couldn't follow much of the science, and Hubbard's feverish dreams reminded me of accounts of bad LSD trips.\" He concludes, however, that \"if you're already a fan of any of"

It was published by Oxford University Press in 1952 and adapted as a television series by the BBC in 1954. In 1957 the first American edition was published by Criterion Books.

Isabella Clinton is the daughter and only child of a French noblewoman, from the House of Valois, and an English soldier. With her father dead, she is heir to his estate but prefers working in the fields to learning to be a proper noblewoman. This is made clear from her sharp tongue and blunt way of speaking.\nAfter the death of her father, it seems that the Black Prince has forgotten Isabella and her mother. It is quite a long time before Isabella is finally summoned to court by King Richard \u2013 and when she finally is, it is to be companion to her young kinswoman, Isabella of the House of Valois, Madame of France and soon to be Queen of England.\nIt is through Isabella Clinton's eyes that we see the love Isabella of France develops for King Richard. Although only seven years old at her first appearance, the Queen shows maturity for her age \u2013 but what happens to her throughout the book causes her great sorrow, even though she does not show it on the outside.\nIn a star review, Kirkus Reviews described The Gentle Falcon as a \"sparkling, poignant fictionalized biography\" and \"princely reading fare.\" while the Wisconsin library bulletin reprinted a review by the Bulletin of the Children's Book Center that called it \"An intriguing story...\"\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation produced a seven-episode television series based on The Gentle Falcon, which was broadcast from 15 June 1954.

The Rolling Stones (also published under the name Space Family Stone in the United Kingdom) is a 1952 science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein.\nA condensed version of the novel had been published earlier in Boys' Life (September, October, November, December 1952) under the title \"Tramp Space Ship\".  It was published in hardcover that year by Scribner's as part of the Heinlein juveniles.\nAs with his other novels, Heinlein and his wife Virginia \"spent countless hours in research, fiercely dedicated to getting it right for their readers.\"\nHeinlein later credited the 1905 Ellis Parker Butler short story \"Pigs Is Pigs\" with inspiring the flat cat incident.  A similar concept and plotline appeared later in the Star Trek episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\". According to screenwriter David Gerrold, the show's producers noticed similarities in the two stories and asked Heinlein for permission to use the idea.  Heinlein asked for an autographed copy of the script, but otherwise did not object, noting that both stories owed something to the Butler story \"and possibly to Noah\".\nIn Chapter XIII (\"Caveat Vendor\"), Hazel Stone tells the judge, \"I am a stranger here in a strange land\" (paraphrasing Exodus 2:22). Heinlein later used the same Biblical quote as the title of his Hugo-award winning novel of 1961.\nThe book makes several references to Hazel as an influential figure in founding the Lunar colony. Fourteen years later, Heinlein published The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, which tells the story of the Lunar revolution, including a small but vital role that Hazel Stone played as a child (no specifics of this role are mentioned in The Rolling Stones; she is portrayed here simply as a \"founding Father\"). Hazel, Castor, and Pollux reappear in Number of the Beast and The Cat Who Walks Through Walls. Hazel, alone, appears in To Sail Beyond the Sunset.\nDr. Lowell Stone (\"Buster\") is quoted in a chapter heading in The Cat Who Walks Through Walls and referenced as Chief Surgeon at Ceres General. In that same book, Hazel states that Roger and Edith are now living in the extrasolar colony known as Fiddler's Green (itself first named in Friday).\nThe general description of the Martian met by Lowell is similar to the description of the Martians depicted in Red Planet and later in Stranger in a Strange Land.\nGroff Conklin described the novel as \"a thoroughly delightful job\". Boucher and McComas praised it as \"easily the most plausible, carefully detailed picture of an interplanetary future we will encounter in any year\". P. Schuyler Miller cited the novel's \"freshness and simplicity,\" characterizing it as \"a life-size portrait-gallery of real people living in a real world of the future, every detail of which fits into place with top-tolerance precision\".\nSurveying Heinlein's juvenile novels, Jack Williamson characterized Heinlein's story as \"a dream of personal freedom\" written with \"an enviable craftsmanship\", noted that the novel \"carries its thematic burden tightly\", unlike Heinlein's later adult novels, and praised The Rolling Stones for its \"sense of an accurately extrapolated future background, with all of the new technologies given an air of commonplace reality\".\nGregory Benford (2011). \"Terraforming Ganymede with Robert A.

It corresponds temporally to part of Nin's published diaries. It consists mainly of material that was left out of the published version because it would have hurt people involved or their relationships with Ana\u00efs Nin had it been published at the time.\nThe book displays the range of Nin's moods and emotions.  She avoided re-writing or writing long afterward, when possible, in order to preserve the truth about how she felt at the time of each entry.  As the diaries go on, they become more poetical or stream of consciousness, as opposed to objective.  She is sometimes very explicit about her sexual activity and how she feels about it.  The sources of some of her erotic stories can be recognized here.  Generally the bazaar Latin American settings for some of her stories were first written down here, as told her by Gonzalo Mor\u00e9 and his wife Helba.  The contrasts between her various emotional and sexual relationships as well as the fluctuations in each are very striking and clear.\nSince Nin kept a diary for 60 years, more volumes may appear."

The illegitimate son of the Norman nobleman Rauf of Bulaire, Earl of Lessford, he has been raised as a Saxon by his mother the Lady Hild and maternal grandfather Alfgar, a belted knight whose lands were confiscated after the Battle of Evesham and given to his bitter enemy, the drunkard lord of Tressling. Walter is in love with Tressling's beautiful daughter Engaine but is below her station. After participating in a student riot (led by new acquaintance Tristram Griffen, son of a fletcher and a chamber-deacon student himself) to rescue two fellow students from being hanged by the local watch, Walter attends a lecture by Friar Roger Bacon and is inspired to journey to the far-away semi-mythical land of Cathay. Walter and Tristram elude a hunt for them as leaders of the riot but Walter learns that his father has been killed by an arrow through the heart. The Countess of Bulaire, known as \"the Norman woman\" and the cause of Walter's illegitimacy when she married Rauf (thereby breaking his chivalric vow to Hild), has taken revenge by hanging six commoners without a trial while imprisoning their families.\nWalter is summoned to Bulaire Castle for the funeral but stops first at Gurnie, where he finds his mother enfeebled and the impoverished Alfgar, against all knightly traditions, in trade collecting discarded metals to sell so that he can make cheese. Tristram seeks him out to warn him that he is going to lead a raid on the Bulaire castle to free the families. After Walter sees that the children have been starved, he devises a plan for Tristram and his men to steal into the castle to rescue the families. The next day Walter encounters Engaine, who tells him she has reluctantly resolved to marry Edmond, Rauf's legal heir and Walter's half-brother. In despair but to no avail he argues that if not for a shipwreck that led Rauf to marry the countess, Walter would be the legitimate heir and marrying Engaine. Walter impulsively makes a vow of devotion to her, echoing Rauf's vow to the Lady Hild many years before. He attends the reading of the will and is bequeathed a pair of boots he has admired since childhood together with an expensive cup. However his father also wills him into the service of King Edward for life, so he decides to flee England, taking Tristram with him.\nWalter's inheritance gets them as far as Antioch, where they meet Lu Chung (the \"Bird Who Feathers His Own Nest\"), the immense and corrupt Chinese agent of the powerful Greek merchant Anthemus, and are permitted to barter for entry into his service. Impressed by Walter's cleverness and Tristram's physicality, Anthemus makes a place for them on a gift-bearing caravan, including a harem of 81 beautiful women, heading east to the court of Kublai Khan. Anthemus shows his contempt for them by positioning them at the rear of the train, giving them the small black thief Mahmoud ibn Asseult as their servant boy, and providing a poor yurt and equipment borne by sickly camels. On the eve of their arrival in Maragha, where they are to join up with their escort, Mongol general Bayan of the Hundred Eyes and his army of the Ilkhan, one of the women\u00a0\u2013 the sister of Anthemus, Maryam (characterized as the Black Rose, a nickname for the spice cloves) \u2013 escapes the harem.  With Lu Chung's help she finds her way to the two Englishmen, who agree to help her escape to a sympathetic relative because they are convinced by her blue eyes that she is half-English. The next day Maryam disappears while Walter and Tris win service with Bayan when Tris recklessly but successfully challenges the Mongol bowmen during an archery contest conducted to keep the restless Mongol warriors busy.\nThey travel with the army now, provided by Bayan with the finest yurt and the best animals, including splendid horses. Maryam has returned, however, finding herself more afraid of her uncle than she had been of Anthemus. Walter agrees to have her travel with them disguised as a dark-skinned servant boy, all three risking the deadly consequences that would follow their being caught by the Mongol general. Additional tension arises when Maryam gives Tris, who speaks only English, lessons in Bi-chi, the Mongolian-based pidgin of the caravan trade, causing Walter (who earlier tried and failed to do so) to resent being left out. Little by little, however, it becomes apparent that Maryam has developed a deep emotion for Walter. The journey east sees Walter curry the favor of Bayan through being a competent chess-player and Tristram demonstrate the power of the English longbow instructing an astonished horde."

It depicts Natty in the final year of his life still proving helpful to people in distress on the American frontier.

The trapper \u2013 The story's main protagonist. Never mentioned by name, we infer by references to other books that this is Natty Bumppo in his 87th (or 83rd) and final year. He is the wise, cunning mind that keeps the white settlers alive through repeated, dangerous situations. Captain Duncan Middleton's grandparents were his close friends.\nIshmael Bush \u2013 Rugged immigrant. Frequently described as dirty, lazy and coarse. Often referred to as a \u201csquatter\u201d because he lays claim to land without purchasing it from the government or the Indians. He is running from the law because he has aided in kidnaping Inez, Middleton's young wife.\nEsther Bush \u2013 Ishmael's hard, careworn wife, mother of his 14 children (seven sons and seven daughters). Sometimes a woman of action, sometimes a woman of quiet complaints.\nEllen Wade \u2013 The niece of Esther's deceased first husband (husband's sister's daughter) who lives with them as their ward since she was orphaned. Ishmael intends to marry her to his eldest son Asa, but she is in love with Paul Hover.\nAbiram White \u2013 Esther Bush's brother. Kidnapper of Inez de Certavallos-Middleton before story begins. Murders his nephew Asa Bush, but isn't discovered until nearly the end of the book. The book's most base character.\nInez de Certavallos-Middleton \u2013 The beautiful, petite bride of Captain Duncan Uncas Middleton, daughter of a wealthy landowner in Louisiana. A devout Catholic, determined to convert her husband to her faith.\nCaptain Duncan Uncas Middleton \u2013 Grandson of Major Duncan Heyward and Alice Munro-Heyward of The Last of the Mohicans, who rescues his bride from Abiram White and sees to the proper burial of Natty Bumppo at the end of the narrative.\nPaul Hover \u2013 The country-wise, impetuous bee-hunter, who is betrothed to Ellen Wade. Nearly every comment he makes references bees in some fashion.\nDr. Obed Bat Latinized as Battius \u2013 a physician-naturalist. He had joined himself to the Bush caravan as family physician, but he took the opportunity of going into the wilderness to make forays into the surrounding country to gather specimens of flora and fauna. Like the character of David the psalmodist in The Last of the Mohicans he both provides comic relief and a foil by which Cooper may compare the relative merits of Natty Bumppo's frontier practicality with theoretical knowledge. Obed and David are also similar to Hetty Hutter in The Deerslayer as people held in awe and unmolested by the Native Americans because of their mystical qualities as medicine men. When Obed learns of Inez and her circumstances, he joins her husband's party to rescue her. His speech is frequently didactic, often reciting a fictitious genus and species for each animal or plant he encounters.\nAsinus \u2013 Dr. Battius's trusty donkey, whose bray proves to be a life-saving measure for the doctor and his friends in the face of stampeding bison and hostile Native Americans.\nHector \u2013 Natty's wise old hunting dog, who dies before Natty but is preserved through primitive taxidermy as a comfort to the dying frontiersman. His plaintive whine is the precursor of danger in the narrative. Middleton's dogs are related to Hector - descendants from a puppy that Natty sent as a gift to Middleton's grandfather years ago.\nMahtoree \u2013 A brave and crafty Teton Sioux chief, who wants Ellen and Inez for his fourth and fifth wives. He is killed by Hard Heart.\nHard Heart \u2013 A brave, handsome, and trustworthy Pawnee warrior, who helps Natty and Middleton escape from their enemies and manages an amazing escape from certain death at the hands of the Tetons. He leads the final battle against the Tetons, killing Mahtoree and taking his scalp for a prize. He becomes the husband of Tachechana, Mahtoree's beautiful widow, and protector and benefactor of her aged father, Le Balafr\u00e9, and Natty Bumppo, who comes to love him like a son. His name links him to Natty's admired Delawares, whose nickname in French is le Coeur-dur, \"hard heart.\" The trapper (Natty) is drawn to Hard Heart as a noble warrior in the likeness of his dear friend Uncas, The Last of the Mohicans.\nWeucha \u2013 A treacherous Teton brave, whom Hard Heart dramatically kills with his own tomahawk.\nLe Balafr\u00e9 \u2013 French for \"the scarred one\", so named by the French Canadian traders and soldiers, he is the very aged Teton father-in-law of Mahtoree, father of Tachechana, who as a character corresponds to Tamenund in The Last of the Mohicans.\nTachechana \u2013 Youngest wife of Mahtoree.\nThe story opens with Ishmael, his family, Ellen and Abiram slowly making their"

Autobiography of a Yogi examines the life and spiritual development of Paramahansa Yogananda.  The book describes Yogananda's childhood family life, his search for his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, the establishment of his first school, Yogoda Satsanga Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, and his journey to America where he lectured to thousands, established Self-Realization Fellowship and visited Luther Burbank, a renowned botanist to whom the book is dedicated.  The book then describes Yogananda's return visit to India in 1935, where he encountered leading spiritual figures such as Therese Neumann in Bavaria, the Hindu saint Ananda Moyi Ma, Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Sir C. V. Raman, and Giri Bala, \"the woman yogi who never eats.\" Finally, Yogananda describes his return to the West, where he continued to establish his teachings in America, including the writing of the Autobiography.\nThe preface was written by anthropologist Walter Evans-Wentz, a writer who was a pioneer in the study of Tibetan Buddhism in the west, most notably through his translations of The Tibetan Book of the Dead and Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa. In the preface he wrote, \"His unusual life-document is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be published in the West.\"\nYukteswar Giri, Yogananda's guru, told him about a significant prediction made by Lahiri Mahasaya, Yukteswar's guru. Yukteswar heard him say, \"About fifty years after my passing,\" he said, \"my life will be written because of a deep interest in yoga which the West will manifest. The yogic message will encircle the globe, and aid in establishing that brotherhood of man which results from direct perception of the One Father.\" In 1945, fifty years after Lahiri Mahasaya's passing in 1895, the Autobiography was complete and ready for publication.\nIn 1999, Autobiography of a Yogi was designated one of the \"100 Most Important Spiritual Books of the 20th Century\" by a panel of theologians and luminaries convened by HarperCollins publishers. According to Philip Goldberg, who wrote American Veda, \"...\u00a0the Self-Realization Fellowship, which represents Yogananda's Legacy, is justified in using the slogan, \"The Book that Changed the Lives of Millions.\"  It has sold more than four million copies and counting\u00a0...\" Autobiography of a Yogi is the most popular of Yogananda's books and SRF has published the book into over fifty languages.\nAutobiography of a Yogi has introduced meditation and yoga to many Westerners since its publication. The book has many famous advocates, particularly in the business and entertainment communities.\nOne of the most famous advocates of the book was Steve Jobs, the co-founder, and formerly Chairman and CEO of Apple Inc. Jobs \"first read Autobiography of a Yogi as a teenager, then re-read [the book] ... once a year ever since.\" Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com, told his story of attending Steve Jobs' memorial service, where the attendees were handed a small brown box on their way out. \"This is going to be good,\" he thought. \"I knew that this was a decision he made, and whatever it was, it was the last thing he wanted us all to think about.\" The box contained a copy of the book.\nGeorge Harrison, lead guitarist of the Beatles, received his first copy of Autobiography of a Yogi from Ravi Shankar in 1966 and, according to Shankar, \"that was where his (George Harrison's) interest in Vedic culture and Indian-ness began.\" Gary Wright, who wrote the song Dream Weaver, wrote: \"In 1972, my friend George Harrison invited me to accompany him on a trip to India. A few days before we left, he gave me a copy of the book Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda. Needless to say the book inspired me deeply, and I became totally fascinated with Indian culture and philosophy.  My trip was an experience I will never forget.\"\nElvis Presley was introduced to Autobiography of a Yogi in 1965 by his hair dresser-turned-guru, Larry Geller. Elvis continued to study the book throughout the 1970s.  He left a copy of the book behind in a Nashville hotel room on 21 January 1977.  Later on this book was auctioned off with a letter of authenticity\nThe actress Mariel Hemingway says that she was introduced to the Autobiography of a Yogi by Peter Evans, a direct disciple of Yogananda.  She was \"mesmerized by the Autobiography of a Yogi and loved the whole great Hindu tradition of spiritual seeking\u00a0...\"\nThe actor Dennis Weaver gave a copy of the book to Linda Evans, saying that it had changed his life. Evans says"

The Sesame Street Dictionary contains definitions for around 1300 words, with each definition being accompanied by a sample sentence and relevant illustration depicting a character from Sesame Street. The text was written by Linda Hayward and the illustrations were drawn by Joe Mathieu. The illustrations and example sentences are often intended to be humorous, featuring jokes and amusing situations. For example, the definition for \"above\" is accompanied by an image of Grover flying an aeroplane above some trees, which leads into an illustration for the next word, \"accident\", which depicts Grover parachuting to the ground, his plane having crashed into the tree. Homonyms are highlighted by The Amazing Mumford, the Muppet magician, who draws them out of a hat. No pronunciations are included with the definitions.\nThe book is designed for children between the ages of 3 and 8, both those who are able to read and those without reading ability. The words were selected by professional educators for their likelihood of being encountered by a child either through books or everyday experiences.  Depending on the age and educational level of the reader, the book can expand a child's vocabulary, help with \"reading readiness\" and function as a first dictionary.\nThe dictionary was first published in 1980 by Random House, in conjunction with Sesame Street producers Children's Television Workshop, in both a hardback edition and a special library binding. In 1986, it was republished  by the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Educational Corporation under the title Big Bird's Sesame Street Dictionary. This edition featured an additional 100 pages of illustrations, and was packaged as an 8-volume set, with 45 pages per volume. The original one-volume dictionary was reissued in 2004, again by Random House, as part of the Sesame Street franchise's 35th anniversary. This version was accompanied by an audio CD containing songs from the television program, including \"The Cookie Rhyming Song\", \"Elmo's Rap Alphabet\" and \"Off To School\".\nWhen it was first published, the dictionary received praise from reviewers, and became a standard work in school libraries. Writing in the School Library Journal, Daisy Kouzel described it as \"exploding with good fun\", adding that \"youngsters will find unending entertainment in its big, colorful pages and will enrich their vocabulary in the process.\" Barbara Safford's Guide to Reference Materials for School Library Media Centers listed it as \"highly recommended\". Kenneth Kister, in his reference source guide Kister's Best Dictionaries for Adults and Young People, was also positive about the work, although he was critical of the fact that the 8-volume edition published in 1986 retailed at a significantly higher price without adding much worthwhile new material.\nRupp, Rebecca (1998).

The Mayne Inheritance tells the story of Patrick Mayne, a young man who migrated to Australia from his impoverished background in County Tyrone, Ireland in 1841. He was born in Cookstown, County Tyrone, Ireland in 1824. He soon moved to the infant town of Brisbane where he found work as a slaughterman in an abattoir. In 1848 a sawyer, Robert Cox, was savagely murdered at Kangaroo Point and a considerable amount of money was presumed to have been stolen.\nThe next year, Patrick Mayne married and, despite being a poorly paid labourer, bought his own butcher's shop in what is now Brisbane's central business district. He then expanded his business empire through investing cleverly and soon became one of Brisbane's richest men. Patrick became one of the aldermen on the first Brisbane Municipal Council in 1859.\nHe died in 1865 from an unspecified illness, and according to the book during his dying days confessed to the murder of Robert Cox. He left behind a widow and five children who had to survive in a hostile colonial environment which ostracised them for being the children of a confessed murderer. The second half of the book deals mainly with the lives of these children, none of whom married, and in particular James O'Neil Mayne who used the wealth inherited from his father to become a philanthropist. His most notable deed was funding the purchase of 270 acres (1.1\u00a0km\u00b2) of land at St Lucia for the University of Queensland. This spacious riverside site is still the main campus of the University.\nThe story of The Mayne Inheritance spans nearly a century, from Patrick's arrival in Australia in the 1840s to the death of his last surviving child, Mary Emelia Mayne, in 1940, at the age of 81. The narrative takes place within the context of Brisbane's history, and the reader is also taken on the journey of Brisbane's transformation from an isolated colonial hamlet to a major Australian city.\nThe book was adapted for the stage by Errol O'Neill and premiered at Brisbane's La Boite Theatre in 2004.\n\"The Mayne Inheritance\".

The Shadowbox breaks in on Holovision transmissions, ordinarily dictated by Raja Flattery.\nThe plan of Raja Flattery is to build a new Voidship, one that will take him away from Pandora.

Left in an unnamed town in Berry by his Jewish parents, who returned to Soviet Russia and oblivion, the timid Jonas Milk lives quietly above his second-hand bookshop and also deals in rare stamps. He feels at home amongst the other small businesses in the town, until he marries his maid, a much younger woman with a bad reputation and converts to Catholicism. She is neither a good housekeeper nor a faithful wife, and causes Milk considerable embarrassment and shame. Though she disappears with other men from time to time, she always returns soon after to Milk.\nHowever, one day when she has not come home and Milk, to spare himself yet more embarrassment, lies over her whereabouts. As the days pass, his lies are believed by fewer and fewer neighbours, who begin to shun him, \nand somebody informs the police. His anguish is increased by the fact that his most valuable stamps, which only she knew about, are gone from his safe.\nThe police first call round for an allegedly informal chat and  then call him in to the station for a formal interrogation, followed by an exhaustive search of his premises. They are suspicious because he has not reported a missing person and, like the rest of the town, wonder if her body is in the canal as an end to her overt infidelities.\nMilk's worries are initially eased when a hotel chambermaid tells him that his wife has gone off with a salesman whose room she shared whenever he visited the town. Innocent all along of any crime, he first thinks of going round to the police station but, no longer able to face the hostility of the community and the pressure of the police, instead hangs himself.\nThe story has been adapted for the BBC radio drama series BBC Radio 4 - Afternoon Drama, first broadcast on 3 August 2011, starring Steven McNicoll and Francesca Dymond.\nhttp://apenguinaweek.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/penguin-no-1854-little-man-from.html\nhttp://insidebooks.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/book-of-books-little-man-from-archangel.html\n\"Explore the British Library\".\n\"BBC Radio 4 - Drama, Georges Simenon - the Other Simenon, the Little Man from Archangel\"."

Shortly after midnight on September 5, Mateo receives a phone call from Death-Cast, a company that rose to prominence seven years prior and is able to predict the deaths of individuals, informing him that he is now a Decker, someone with only twenty-four hours (or less) left to live. Mateo initially intends to spend his End Day in his bedroom but decides to try to push himself to truly live, reluctantly downloading Last Friend, an app developed to help lonely Deckers find someone to spend their End Day with. Rufus is in the middle of beating up Peck, his ex-girlfriend Aimee's new boyfriend, when he receives his own call from Death-Cast. His friends Malcolm and Tagoe remind Rufus not to get carried away because of the news. He allows Peck to leave so that he can return to his foster home to say his goodbyes. Rufus, Aimee, Malcolm and Tagoe, collectively known as The Plutos, hold a funeral for Rufus at his foster home but it is interrupted by Peck, who calls the police to have Rufus arrested for assault. Rufus flees and goes on the run, downloading Last Friend so that he won't live out his final day alone.\nMateo and Rufus meet through Last Friend and decide to spend the day accompanying each other. Rufus agrees to go with Mateo to the hospital so Mateo can visit his father, who has been in a coma for two weeks. Mateo says goodbye to his father and leaves him a note for him to read when he wakes up. Mateo and Rufus then go to see Lidia, Mateo's best friend, and her baby daughter (and Mateo's goddaughter) Penny. Not wanting to make Lidia upset, Mateo pretends everything is normal, but leaves her an envelope of cash before leaving and blocks her phone number. Rufus receives a call from Aimee telling him that Malcolm and Tagoe were arrested when they attempted to hold off the police to give him more time to escape. Rufus opens up about his past, explaining that his parents and sister all received a phone call from Death-Cast on the same day and drowned when their car crashed into the river, leaving him as the only survivor. Rufus and Mateo discuss the plans they had for their life: Mateo always wanted to be an architect and Rufus wishes he could have turned his passion for photography into a career. As their friendship deepens, Mateo becomes bolder and Rufus begins to take color photos for his Instagram page, @rufusonpluto, as opposed to his usual monochrome posts to signify his End Day. Rufus buys Mateo some Lego bricks and, as they are leaving, they barely manage to survive an explosion at a nearby gym. Mateo builds a sanctuary while they are on the train using the bricks. Rufus and Mateo head to the cemetery so that Mateo can visit his mother's grave, only to find a groundskeeper is in the process of digging Mateo's grave beside hers. Mateo leaves his Lego sanctuary at his mother's grave and sits down inside his own with Rufus, talking about the afterlife and debating what will happen to them in the near future.\nRufus and Mateo go to Make-A-Moment, a centre for Deckers where they can experience dangerous activities without fear, and the two fake skydive. Unimpressed, Mateo decides to take Rufus to World Travel Arena, a virtual reality experience that he believes will be more fun. On the way, they stop by the Hudson river and Rufus contemplates the death of his family and is able to finally come to terms with it. Realising the importance of a proper goodbye, Mateo uses Rufus' phone to call Lidia and asks her to meet them at the Travel Arena. Rufus, Mateo and Lidia go on an \"around the world in eighty minutes\" tour at the Arena and jump off of a waterfall, allowing Rufus to conquer his fear of the water. Rufus receives a call from Malcolm and Tagoe, who were released from custody, and tells them to bring Aimee and meet him at the Graveyard, a club for Deckers.\nThe group dance together at Graveyard and Rufus convinces Mateo to sing karaoke with him. After their performance, Mateo finally works up the courage to kiss Rufus, who asks why it took him so long. Rufus is able to say a proper goodbye to the Plutos and Mateo tries to help Lidia comprehend her life without him. Peck and his gang arrive at the club, having tracked Rufus using his Instagram posts, with a loaded gun. Peck tries to shoot Rufus but Aimee tries to talk him down, giving Mateo enough time to cause a commotion, making Peck drop the gun. Mateo and Rufus return to Mateo's apartment and Mateo asks if they can go back to the hospital so that he can come out to his father and tell him about their End Day. Mateo sings and plays the piano for Rufus, who videos the moment before taking a goofy picture with Mateo for his final"

Reviews of the book have been mixed, with critic Rachel Hyland of Geek Speak Magazine writing, \"Graceffa knows a lot about YA dystopian conventions, and they are all present and accounted for here. This is by no means a bad thing - an enjoyable romp through this genre doesn\u2019t necessarily require too much divergence (no pun intended) from the established norms - but it is worth noting that most everything in his Eden has pretty much happened before, in one way or another. Still, it is fun to see just how those ever-trusty elements are put together, and there is a nice twist on the almost essential love triangle that is actually pretty awesome.\"\nCommon Sense Media gave the novel a rating of three out of five stars, stating, in part, \"This perplexing novel uses every convention of dystopian YA science fiction... Children of Eden's main character, Rowan, never seems to stop talking and stating the obvious. The world-building doesn't seem to make much sense, and coincidence seems to be the major motivator of the plot. Many readers will no doubt be attracted by the story's breathless earnestness, but the more critical among them may roll their eyes.\" \nKirkus Reviews also gave the book a mixed review, explaining, \"The tropes of the teen dystopia abound, but Graceffa keeps things moving quickly enough that readers won\u2019t mind. ... After an intrusively expository start, Rowan\u2019s journey from loner to rebel is smartly paced and cleverly constructed. ... the aftertaste of Eden has a bit of a 'been there, done that' feel, but the author injects just enough original thought and spins the yarn fast enough that readers will still have a good time.\" The review concludes, commenting, \"A promising start that gets more right than wrong.\"\n\"Children of Eden Book - Joey Graceffa\".

The Plum Book originated in 1952 during the Eisenhower administration to identify presidentially appointed positions within the federal government. For twenty years, the Democratic Party had controlled the federal government. When President Eisenhower took office, the Republican Party requested a list of government positions that the new president could fill. The next edition of the Plum Book appeared in 1960 and has since been published every four years, just after a presidential election.\nOlder editions of the Plum Book are held by any federal depository library. The Government Printing Office (now the United States Government Publishing Office) began to make the Plum Book available as an app for the first time in December 2012. The 2020 edition was published on December 1, 2020.\nPlum Books are considered an important resource for presidents-elect of the United States during their presidential transitions, aiding them in identifying federal government positions to which they can name appointees.\nAs of December 2020, there are 7,935 political appointments across the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. federal government. Many of these positions must be filled by the incoming president every four years while others are career appointments that outlast presidential administrations.\nThese positions are published in the Plum Book, a new edition of which is released after each United States presidential election. The list is provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\n\n\n\n\nList of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation\nList of United States political appointments across party lines\nSomerset, Gary. \"PLUM BOOK AVAILABLE AT GPO\" (PDF) (08\u201331).

Flamesong is a 1985 science-fantasy novel written by M. A. R. Barker and published by DAW Books. It is the second novel to take place on the fictional planet of T\u00e9kumel, also featured in Barker's role-playing game Empire of the Petal Throne (1974). The plot follows a group of far-future legionaries who discover an ancient \"tubeway car\" by accident and inadvertently use it to explore various exotic locales.\nFlamesong is not a direct sequel to the first T\u00e9kumel novel The Man of Gold, as it features a different cast of characters. It also hints towards the beginning of a larger, more world-changing story arc. Unlike The Man of Gold, Flamesong was only published in the U.S. and no foreign-language editions followed. It has not been reprinted or published in digital format. As a consequence, Flamesong is somewhat difficult to find in the second-hand market and is more obscure than its predecessor.\nAs is the case with The Man of Gold, Flamesong features no separate description of the setting, although a short treatise on its fictional languages is subjoined. Also included are advertisements for the Tsoly\u00e1ni dictionary and grammar and a role-playing source book detailing the setting. The novel attracted favorable reviews but was not commercially very successful.\nFlamesong was the last collaboration between Barker and the DAW editor Donald A. Wollheim. Reportedly, they fell out after Barker urged Wollheim to take legal action against Raymond Feist, believing the latter's Riftwar series to be a plagiate of T\u00e9kumel. Barker also had a dispute with the role-playing game publisher TSR which claimed to be entitled to royalties from the T\u00e9kumel novels.\nThe Encyclopedia of Science Fiction entry written by David Langford and Neal Tringham calls Flamesong \"an exotic travelogue\" that is less successful than The Man of Gold, but interesting nonetheless. Langford and Tringham opine that Flamesong is better than the three T\u00e9kumel novels that followed it, and that Barker was more talented as a world-builder than he was as a novelist.\nA retrospective review posted on the genre fiction blog Pornokitsch describes the novel as more consistent and better balanced than The Man of Gold. Regardless, the plot consists mainly of \"railroaded events\" driven by \"a magical place-hopping, plot-forwarding tube.\" Despite its obvious shortcomings, the novel is \"action-packed\" and \"a lot of fun\", successfully inviting the reader to learn more about T\u00e9kumel.\nA website dedicated to T\u00e9kumel collecting describes the novel as the best written of the series. While the \"dynamics among the soldiers\" are sometimes implausible, the characterization is generally good and the novel has a better structured plot than its predecessor. Flamesong may also function as a \"gold mine of information\" for T\u00e9kumel fans.\nWriting for the Black Gate website, John O'Neill describes the novel as \"an even more ambitious sequel [that] was highly acclaimed\u2026 but only by those few who read it.\"\nReview by Lynn F.

Deborah Collins Stephens is the cofounder and managing partner of the Center for Innovative Leadership.  She is also the author of One Size Fits One and co-authored The Maslow Business Reader, with Abraham H. Maslow.\nIn the book, the authors share advice gained from personal experiences on topics including family life, work, and love - and the difficulties of balancing these issues.  As the title suggests, the book offers fifty ways in which the reader can stay focused and upbeat when misfortune strikes.  The book is structured topically, with each chapter dealing with different types of issues such as dealing with misfortune, managing mistakes, understanding money and how to network with other women.  Each chapter concludes with a \"WIT (Women in Transition) Kit,\" which contains action plans and exercises related to the previous section.  The chapter \"Understanding Money and a Women\u2019s Worth\" provides \"straightforward directives\" on topics such as net worth, tax returns and how to create a financial plan.\nThis Is Not the Life I Ordered reached the best seller list of the San Francisco Chronicle for the second time in June 2007.

The story revolves around protagonist Alan Donnell, having just turned 17 and living on a space ship for all his life. While mankind has finally mastered interstellar travel, it is still bound to the speed of light using so-called Lexman drives. As a result, spacefarers experience the FitzGerald contraction, aging only a couple of weeks during their flights, where -- depending on the actual distance traveled -- years or even centuries pass by. This leads to the strange situation that Alan biologically is 17, but 300 in earth years.\nRumor has it that already in 2570, i.e. 1300 years prior to the story time, the Cavour hyperdrive was invented by seclusive scientist James Hudson Cavour, who however vanished after his has announcement that he finally achieved success.\nAs a result, spacefarers have become somewhat separated from Earth and their colonies, typically only stopping for loading, unloading and maintenance overhaul where they live in almost ghetto-like spacemen enclaves, and otherwise living in the segregated community of their ships.\nFor Alan, this setting feels increasingly constricted. Like his brother 8 years ago (experienced as just 6 weeks on the starship) on the last Earth stop, he leaves the starmen's enclave to explore earth. Being more lucky than his brother back then, he makes contact with a helpful wealthy gambler, Max Hawkes, who helps Alan find his brother and return him back to the ship. \nThis time, Alan stays on earth -- and subsequently goes on a search for the Cavour hyperdrive.\nFinally succeeding in retrieving crucial information and, also thanks to the wealth inherited from Max, building the Cavour hyperdrive, his maiden voyage takes him to his father's spaceship, reuniting with his brother almost 8 years later, now being twins of same age again due to the effects of the Fitzgerald contraction.\nGalaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale gave the novel a mixed review, rating it three stars out of five and finding that while \"exciting story elements abound, . . . too many happenstances and line-of-least resistance writing steal too much of its effectiveness.\"\n\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\", Galaxy Science Fiction, December 1959, p.151\nChalker, Jack L.; Mark Owings (1998).

The epigraph \u2014 on the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, from a speaker who clearly has great feeling for the destroyed cities \u2014 suggests that his home city has been devastated. In some of the tales, such as the opening story in both books, \u201cThe Star-Pit,\u201d the narrator\u2019s family and children have been destroyed in a horrific war many years before and many light years away: a war of a sort, which, in the future the story depicts, has become so common that it would seem to be a background reality gotten through for better or for worse by pretty much everyone who currently survives. And the fantasies, such as \u201cPrismatica,\u201d \u201cDog in a Fisherman\u2019s Net,\u201d and \u201cRuins\u201d all deal with the possibilities or the wages of journeying from one's home.\n\"Nebula Awards 1968\".

Clarke. There are, however, two exceptions. \"The Lion of Comarre\" (no. 17), although published in magazine form as early as 1949, first appeared in book form in 1968, in an omnibus edition together with Clarke's early novel Against the Fall of the Night (1953). \"The Steam-powered Word-Processor\" (no. 112) had previously appeared in Clarke's \"science-fictional autobiography\" Astounding Days (1989).\nArthur C.

As its title indicates, the book is an entry in the long-running series of books about the Land of Oz, written by L. Frank Baum and his successors. The publication of The Unknown Witches of Oz was timed to coincide with the centennial of the original Oz book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (as was also true of Gina Wickwar's The Hidden Prince of Oz and Edward Einhorns's Paradox in Oz). Hardenbrook's novel is the first volume of a planned trilogy.",

Locasta is the name that Baum provided his Good Witch of the North in his 1902 dramatization of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Three Adepts are characters that Baum introduced in his final Oz book, Glinda of Oz \u2014 though Hardenbrook changes their names and particulars, making them Locasta's granddaughters.\nLocasta, the Good Witch of the North, is forced out of Oz by the evil witch Mombi. Locasta solicits help to return to Oz, from a boy named Dan, a sixteen-year-old orphan she meets at the Los Angeles Public Library. Back in Oz, she learns that the land is in danger of conquest by a constellation of evil forces, including the Nome King, a genie named Taarna, and the demons and witches of Whaqoland. Locasta joins with Glinda and Princess Ozma, and the Adepts, to foil the villains and restore the moral order.\nIn a notable departure from the practice of earlier writers on Oz, Hardenbrook creates a teenaged protagonist as a romantic interest for Ozma.\nHardenbrook goes farther than many previous Oz authors in an attempt to provide a contemporary conceptual framework for the fictional world of Oz. In a Prologue titled \"The Story So Far,\"  Hardenbrook specifies that Oz exists in a parallel universe, in \"a galaxy very like our own Milky Way\" with \"a star virtually identical to our sun....\" The star has \"a planet that corresponds to Earth\" \u2014 though it differs in possessing \"two extra moons and a polychromatic ring system....\"  The planet contains continents and archipelagoes that include \"Dodgesonia\" and \"Geiselgea\" as well as \"Baumgea.\"\nHardenbrook goes on to summarize the narrative background of the Oz mythos \u2014 the fairy queen Lurline and the whole scope and structure of magic, wizards and sorceresses crucial to Baum's fantasy \u2014 before he gets to his story in earnest.\nHardenbrook writes in a more modern and ironic vein than the traditional Oz authors did; he describes Ozma as \"the only world leader with an unwavering one-hundred-percent job approval rating!\" His malevolent genie comes out of a spray can. Allusions to Bill Clinton, Rush Limbaugh, and environmentalism also occur.\nThe author is a computer adept, and spices his story with elements of technology and virtual reality \u2014 Virtual Sprites and a Virtual Forest.\nPaul Nathanson, Over the Rainbow: The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America, Albany, NY, State University of New York Press, 1991.\nSuzanne Rahn, The Wizard of Oz: Shaping and Imaginary World, New York, Twayne, 1998.\nMichael O'Neal Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L.

                "description": "Winesburg, Ohio (full title: Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life) is a 1919 short story cycle by the American author Sherwood Anderson. The work is structured around the life of protagonist George Willard, from the time he was a child to his growing independence and ultimate abandonment of Winesburg as a young man. It is set in the fictional town of Winesburg, Ohio (not to be confused with the actual Winesburg), which is based loosely on the author's childhood memories of Clyde, Ohio. Mostly written from late 1915 to early 1916, with a few stories completed closer to publication, they were \"...conceived as complementary parts of a whole, centered in the background of a single community.\" ...",

W. Huebsch. release_date: 8 May 1919 (1st edition). Though there is practically no argument about the unity of structure within Winesburg, Ohio, few scholars have concluded that it fits the standards of a conventional novel. Instead, it is typically placed \"...midway between the novel proper and the mere collection of stories,\" known as the short story cycle. Aside from its structural unity, the common setting, characters, symbolism and \"consistency of mood\" are all additional qualities that tie the stories together despite their initial publication as separate tales.\nPromoted to younger writers by Anderson himself, Winesburg, Ohio has served as a representative early example of the modern short story cycle in American letters. Comparisons between Winesburg, Ohio and Jean Toomer's Cane (1923), Ernest Hemingway's In Our Time (1925), William Faulkner's Go Down, Moses (1942), and several of John Steinbeck's works, among others, demonstrate the pervasiveness of the formal innovations made in Anderson's book.\nThe focus on George Willard's development as a young man and a writer has also led some critics to put Winesburg, Ohio within the tradition of \"the American boy book, the Bildungsroman, and the K\u00fcnstlerroman\".\nIt is widely acknowledged that the fictional model of the book's town, Winesburg, is based on Sherwood Anderson's boyhood memories of Clyde, Ohio, where Anderson lived between the ages of eight and nineteen (1884\u20131896), and not the actual town of Winesburg, Ohio. This view is supported by the similarities between the names and qualities of several Winesburg characters and Clyde's townspeople, in addition to mentions of specific geographic details of Clyde and the surrounding area.\nIt is not known why Anderson chose the name Winesburg for the town in the book. What is known is that the name was not necessarily inspired by the stories themselves. In actuality, Anderson had been using Winesburg, Ohio, as a base for Talbot Whittingham, the protagonist of an unfinished novel he had been writing on-and-off for several years prior to the composition of the Winesburg stories.\nA direct relationship between the real Clyde and the fictional Winesburg, however, remains the supposition of scholars. Anderson wrote in A Writer's Conception of Realism that he reacted with \"shock\" when he \"...heard people say that one of my own books Winesburg, Ohio, was an exact picture of Ohio village life.\" The author went on to admit that, \"the hint for almost every character was taken from my fellow lodgers in a large rooming house...\" These lodgers were the \"...young musicians, young writers, painters, actors...\" and others that lived in proximity to Anderson on the North Side of Chicago and to whom he referred as \"The Little Children of the Arts\". The truth probably lies somewhere in between, with memories of Clyde \"merging\" with Anderson's interactions at the boardinghouse.\nBecause Sherwood Anderson was so ambiguous about what directly influenced him, it is difficult to say that any specific writer or work inspired him to write Winesburg, Ohio as a whole. Still, most scholars affirm the obvious connection between Anderson's cycle and the Spoon River Anthology of Edgar Lee Masters (published in April 1915), which Anderson reportedly stayed up all night to read. Though B.W. Huebsch, Anderson's publisher, sent out a statement, upon the release of Winesburg, Ohio, heading off comparisons between the two works by stating (erroneously, as it turns out) that the Winesburg stories were printed in magazines before the Spoon River Anthology was published, the similarities in small-town setting, structure, and mood of the works have been noted by several reviewers, with one going so far as to call Winesburg, Ohio, the Spoon River Anthology \"...put into prose.\"\nGertrude Stein, whose work Anderson was introduced to by either his brother Karl or photographer Alfred Stieglitz between 1912 and 1915, is also said to have played a key role in helping shape the unique style found in the stories. Through his interaction (at first satirizing it before ultimately accepting it as essential to his development) with Stein's Three Lives (1909) and Tender Buttons (1914), Anderson found the plain, unambiguous voice that became a staple of his prose. As indicated by the correspondence the two writers developed after the publication of Winesburg, Ohio, variations on the repetition found in Stein's writing in addition to their mutual appreciation for the sentence as a basic unit of prose were also likely features of her writing that Anderson noticed and drew upon in writing his Winesburg, Ohio. Literary critic Irving Howe summarized the pair's connection aptly when he wrote,"

Bill is a farmboy on a small backward agricultural planet who is drugged, hypnotised, then shanghaied into the Space Troopers and sent to recruit training under a fanged instructor named Deathwish Drang.  After surviving boot camp, he is transferred to active duty as a fuse tender on the flagship of the space fleet in battle with the Chingers, a small reptilian race who are, in Trooper propaganda, portrayed as being 7 feet tall.  Before the battle one of Bill's fellow troopers, known as Eager Beager, is revealed to be an android operated from within by a Chinger, who is in fact only 7 inches tall.  Injured and with the fleet almost destroyed, Bill accidentally fires off a shot from his ship's main gun.  The shot is witnessed by an officer and Bill is proclaimed a hero.\nAs a reward he is sent to the city-planet Helior to receive a medal from the emperor. Bill's city plan is stolen from him on a sightseeing tour.  Losing his plan is a crime, and without his plan it takes him days to get back to the Trooper Transit Center.  When he arrives he finds he is AWOL for missing his transport, and is threatened with arrest and torture.  He escapes and flees into the depths of the city, where he first falls in with a gang of similarly \"deplanned\" outlaws, then finds employment with Helior's garbage disposal service, cannily using the galactic postal service to send garbage to other planets, since Helior has run out of room for it. His unwilling recruitment as a spy to infiltrate an ineptly-run anarchist plot leads to his arrest.  He has been AWOL for so long that now he is considered a deserter. He avoids being shot by a firing squad thanks to a wily lawyer, who points out that technically the entire city, and therefore the entire planet, is under military rule and is a military base, so he never actually went AWOL.  However, he is convicted of sleeping on duty.\nHe is sent to a prison unit working on a planet where the Human-Chinger war continues. Escaping during an attack, he rescues some prisoners and meets a dying Deathwish Drang. He then shoots off his own foot to get off-planet. \nThe book ends with the story coming full circle as Bill, with an artificial foot and Deathwish Drang's fangs, returns to his home planet and recruits more gullible young men, including his own younger brother, into the Troopers without recognizing him. (A recruiter's term of service is reduced for each new trooper they enlist.)\nSix sequels were published, from 1989 to 1992:\nThe first, Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of Robot Slaves (1989), is by Harry Harrison.\nAfter this, the sequels were penned by other writers and edited by Harrison.  Harry Harrison expressed his own disappointment in the series in an interview with Brian Ireland, quoted on Ireland On-Line.:\nThey have a thing in the States called 'share cropping' where you have a series or character, and you have other writers do work with it [...] I never wanted to do it, I'm not interested. But one of the packagers said, coming back to this thing I said about the pornography of violence: Harry, why don't we do a Bill, the Galactic Hero series and actually do some anti-war propaganda instead of all pro war. So they eventually talked me into it. The second one \u2014 Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of Robot Slaves \u2014 I did myself, that was a lot of fun. If they could all be like that. But no, no. We all make mistakes. I'm a professional writer. I earn a living at it. These are the only ones where I did it wrong.\nThe second, Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of Bottled Brains (1990), is by Robert Sheckley and Harry Harrison\nThe third, Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of Tasteless Pleasure (1991), is by David Bischoff and Harry Harrison\nThe fourth, Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of Zombie Vampires (1991), is by Jack C. Haldeman and Harry Harrison\nThe fifth, Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of Ten Thousand Bars (1991), is by David Bischoff and Harry Harrison (Was also published under the title: \"Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of the Hippies from Hell\")\nThe sixth, Bill, the Galactic Hero: The Final Incoherent Adventure (1991), is by David Harris and Harry Harrison\n\"Bill, the Galactic Hero's Happy Holiday\" appeared as a short story in Galactic Dreams (1994) by Harry Harrison\n\nThe standard ways of circumventing relativity in 1950s and 1960s science fiction were hyperspace, subspace and spacewarp. Harrison's contribution was the \"Bloater Drive\".

The book of Genesis tells the story of the slaying of Abel by his brother Cain; the world's first recorded murder.  But the Bible does not say what weapon Cain used. That detail is lost to history.  In 1932, Mitchell Siegel was killed by three gunshots to the chest.  As a result, his son dreamed of a bulletproof man and co-created the world's greatest superhero: Superman. Like Cain's murder weapon, the gun used in this unsolved murder has never been found, until now. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Cal Harper comes face-to-face with his family's greatest secret: his long-lost father, who has been shot with a gun that traces back to Mitchell Siegel's 1932 murder.  When Cal and his father are attacked by a ruthless killer tattooed with the ancient markings of Cain, he learns that the two murders, committed thousands of years apart, have something in common, setting off the hunt for the world's first murder weapon.\n\"Newsarama | GamesRadar+\".\nWorldCat item record\nWorldCat summary\nhttp://www.bradmeltzer.com/novels/book-of-lies/book-of-lies.php"

A 12-year-old boy wakes up in an orphanage one night with no memory of who he is. The only thing he remembers is his name, Robert.\nBut Robert is not his name, and a little girl called Bea knows this. She was there when Lord Alwyn, a once powerful sorcerer, erased all of his memory using the powerful Book of Lies.\nHe meets Bea, who tells of his name. His real name is Marcel. He encounters the mighty Fergus and the haughty Nicola during his stay at the orphanage, both of whose memories are nothing more than lies.\nOne day a mysterious man called Starkey claims to know the real lives of Nicola, Fergus and Marcel.\nUpon meeting his mother, imprisoned by the evil usurper King Pelham, he suddenly is not sure. Is Starkey all that he claims to be? Is his mother his real mother? Is King Pelham really evil, or was that a lie as well? Danger lurks at every corner, and Marcel must stop the most feared Mortregis, beast of war, from rising once again.\nHarperCollins page about the book"

I protested that I knew no such secret. He said, \"But you have printed it in the plainest language.\" I said that I could not have done so because I did not know it. He went to the bookshelves and, taking out a copy of The Book of Lies, pointed to a passage in the despised chapter. It instantly flashed upon me.

The book of Genesis tells the story of the slaying of Abel by his brother Cain; the world's first recorded murder.  But the Bible does not say what weapon Cain used. That detail is lost to history.  In 1932, Mitchell Siegel was killed by three gunshots to the chest.  As a result, his son dreamed of a bulletproof man and co-created the world's greatest superhero: Superman. Like Cain's murder weapon, the gun used in this unsolved murder has never been found, until now. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Cal Harper comes face-to-face with his family's greatest secret: his long-lost father, who has been shot with a gun that traces back to Mitchell Siegel's 1932 murder.  When Cal and his father are attacked by a ruthless killer tattooed with the ancient markings of Cain, he learns that the two murders, committed thousands of years apart, have something in common, setting off the hunt for the world's first murder weapon.\n\"Newsarama | GamesRadar+\".\nWorldCat item record\nWorldCat summary\nhttp://www.bradmeltzer.com/novels/book-of-lies/book-of-lies.php"

Although the location is not mentioned by name in the novel, it is set at the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, where Abbey worked at the time as a fire lookout in the fire tower just east of the main entrance at the North Rim.  Stephen J. Pyne in his memoirs of his years as a firefighter at the North Rim, Fire on the Rim, wrote, concerning Abbey: \"fire busts came and went with hardly a word from the North Rim tower.  Whether Abner was even in the tower, no one could say.  He was a writer, and the only smokes he reported were the ones in his novels.  He lived in a trailer behind the entrance cabin, but he was absent so often that he demonstrated that we did not need a lookout, because having Abner in the tower was the same as having no one. The position was abolished.\"  Abbey was there for four seasons and wrote a nonfiction account in his book Abbey's Road.\nAbbey dedicated the book to his second wife Judy, who had died of acute leukemia just before publication of the novel. Because Judy had spent some time with Abbey when he worked as a fire ranger, some readers naturally believe the book is based on their relationship. However, according to James M. Cahalan's Edward Abbey: A Life, the character of Sandy MacKenzie was actually based on a woman Abbey had an affair with in 1963. His first draft of this book was completed in 1968, two years before Judy's death. Calhalan writes: \"it was a bone of contention in their marriage. He reported on March 17, 1968, that Judy hated it, 'thinking it the story of one of my old love affairs, which in a way it is, but only in a greatly altered and much exaggerated way. If only she understood that there's nothing deader than a dead romance.'\"\nBlack Sun may have been the original title considered to an earlier book Abbey had written about a group of young mohicans driving across the western United States on U.S. Route 66, but the book was never published and remains unpublished to this day. Terry Bisson wrote in American Rebels (2003) that the title Abbey was considering was \"Down the Road.\" The reason that manuscript was never published was because not long after Abbey finished his book, On the Road by Jack Kerouac appeared, and the two books bore so many resemblances that Abbey feared he would be accused of plagiarism if his novel were published.\nThe book is divided into three parts: In the forest; In the sun; and In the evening.\nThe novel is about a rugged fire lookout, Will Gatlin, who falls in love with an American girl half his age and then becomes wrongly blamed when she mysteriously disappears in the nearby Grand Canyon National Park.\nWill Gatlin \u2013 A 37-year-old ranger who mans a fire watch tower in the forest.\nSandy MacKenzie \u2013 A brash 19-year-old woman who is falling in love with the forest.\nArt Ballentine \u2013 A college professor and friend of Will's.\nElsie Ballentine \u2013 Art's wife\nGloria Hollenbeck \u2013 A friend of Sandy's who Will thinks of as the \"rodeo queen.\"\nWendell \u2013 Will's boss, to whom he reports every morning from the fire watch tower\nLawrence J.

The first-run paperback edition by Avon sold only 100,000 copies, where the first run of paperback editions for Desert Solitaire and The Monkey Wrench Gang both sold more than a half million copies. According to James M. Cahalan's biography of Abbey, Edward Abbey: A Life, The New Yorker called Black Sun \"an embarrassingly bad novel.\"  Abbey himself, however, considered it one of the best books he had ever written.\nRonald, Ann (2000).

Serapio of the Carrion Crow family is blinded and scarred in a religious ritual. He becomes the new incarnation of the Crow god. Years later, Captain Xiala is hired to transport him to the city of Tova. Xiala's crew mutinies. Serapio summons an army of crows to kill the crew and save her.\nIn Tova, Naranpa serves as the Sun Priest, head of the Watchers. She attempts reforms to reverse the priesthood's long decline from power. The Carrion Crow hate the Watchers. Decades ago, the Watchers massacred many Crow to destroy the Odohaa Crow religion and increase their own power. Yalitza, leader of the Carrion Crow, dies. Her son Okoa returns home to Tova and attempts to prevent conflict with the Watchers. At her funeral, a riot breaks out and Okoa is falsely accused of an attempted assassination on Naranpa. The Watchers prepare for war with the Odohaa cult. Naranpa is ousted from her position as Sun Priest. She seeks help from her brother Denaochi and Zataya, a witch. Naranpa is killed by rogue priests; Zataya attempts to resurrect her.\nXiala and Serapio arrive in Tova. During an eclipse, Serapio kills most of the Watchers. He is surprised to discover that Naranpa, the true Sun priest, is not there. He is severely injured but is rescued by Okoa. Time seems to freeze and a black sun hangs over Tova as the new year begins.\nThere are four point-of-view characters: Serapio, Xiala, Okoa, and Naranpa. The present-day timeline is interrupted with frequent flashbacks.\nThough Black Sun features many queer characters and has been praised for its inclusivity, a reviewer for SyFy pointed out that \"queerness\" is a product of white supremacy and colonization. In many pre-Columbian civilizations, queer identities would not be considered \"other\" but would be considered normal parts of those societies. Xiala's bisexuality is used to highlight the varying degrees of acceptance among different cultures. Other characters are non-binary and use neopronouns, and this is accepted in most cities in Black Sun's world.\nRoanhorse researched Southeast Asian, Native American, and Mesoamerican civilizations while writing Black Sun. She wanted to write fiction that was different from the traditional European settings of epic fantasy novels. She started by writing the character of Xiala, and stated that \"all the other characters started to come together\" afterwards.\nBlack Sun was nominated for the 2021 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, the 2021 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the 2021 Hugo Award for Best Novel.\nThe work received positive critical reviews with a \"Rave\" rating from the book review aggregator Book Marks based on eight independent reviews. Kirkus Reviews praised the characterization and political intrigue, calling it \"the next big thing\". The book was praised for its characterization and action sequences, as well as its positive and nuanced portrayal of queer characters. A reviewer for Locus praised her \"awareness and respect\" when writing fictionalized versions of Indigenous cultures.\nBlack Sun and Roanhorse's other books have received mixed reviews from Native American commentators. Some have criticized her for cultural appropriation in her portrayals of Indigenous communities. Others have praised her for \"uncolonizing\" fantasy literature.\nAlex Brown (12 Feb 2021). \"Alex Brown Reviews Black Sun by Rebecca Roanhorse\". Locus. Retrieved 24 May 2021.\nFevered Star.

Aubrey meets Admiral Ives, now in Gibraltar, who is pleased with the last mission of HMS Surprise, despite Aubrey's negative report. Mr Yarrow will rephrase it to make the success clearer to the Admiralty. The admiral is now a peer, his deepest wish, and he is a happy man. Aubrey dines with Laura Fielding and her husband, Lieutenant Fielding, who is now satisfied that his wife is true to him and thanks Aubrey for bringing her from Malta to Gibraltar (though it is Maturin who brought her to the ship, saving her from two assassins). Maturin receives news from his intelligence-chief in London, Sir Joseph Blaine, confirming high level infiltration of British intelligence by the French. Maturin's wife Diana has heard rumours of his pretended infidelity in Valletta, Malta, with Mrs Fielding for intelligence reasons. He sends her a letter via Andrew Wray, unsuspecting of Wray's role as a French agent. Maturin learns of his success in Malta, destroying the French intelligence network based there, all but Andr\u00e9 Lesueur taken.\nSurprise is not yet to be broken up; Admiral Ives sends Aubrey on a mission to protect British whalers in the Pacific Ocean from the frigate USS Norfolk, sailing on HMS Surprise on his first voyage around Cape Horn. Aubrey makes all haste to prepare his ship with men and supplies. He recruits Mr Allen, a new master with an in-depth knowledge of whalers, takes on Mr Martin as schoolmaster to the midshipmen, and Mr Hollom, an ageing midshipman. Aubrey wonders if his kindness takes aboard a Jonah with Hollom.\nThe Surprise sails to the farthest east point of Brazil, where the bowsprit is burnt by lightning. During the repairs in Penedo, Pullings sees the USS Norfolk pass by. Mrs Horner, the gunner's wife, engages in an affair with Hollom, and becomes pregnant. Maturin will not interfere with the pregnancy, so she turns to his assistant, Higgins, who leaves her near death. Maturin saves her life. In the Atlantic, Surprise retakes the packet Dana\u00eb, with Lieutenant Lawrence in command. Tom Pullings sails the Danae back to England, after Maturin and Aubrey take possession of a hidden brass box, per instructions to Maturin. Surprise rounds Cape Horn with some losses, and then reaches the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands to refit and recover. There, the gunner kills his wife and Hollom, and re-boards the ship. Off Chile, Horner learns that Higgins performed an abortion on his wife; Higgins disappears from the ship and Horner hangs himself in his cabin. In the Pacific, with information from a Spanish merchantman, Surprise retakes the valuable whaler Acapulco with Caleb Gill in command, nephew to the Norfolk's captain. Mr Allen negotiates with the agent for the whaler in Valparaiso, where the American prisoners are left ashore. Taking the whaler restores the spirit to the crew.\nArrived at the Galapagos archipelago, Maturin and Martin are amazed at the new species they see on land, in the air and in the sea. Surprise picks up men from the whaler Intrepid Fox, now burnt by USS Norfolk. Knowing where the Norfolk is headed, Aubrey sails along the equator west toward the Marquesas. Maturin is disappointed and furious that the promise made to let him explore ashore is broken. Aubrey saves Maturin when he falls overboard one evening, but no one misses them until dawn. The two men are rescued by Polynesian women on a pahi, who ultimately leave them on a small island with a fishing line. The launch from the Surprise finds them. Maturin is needed aboard Surprise, as the group sent to board the pahi was cruelly beaten by the women.\nAfter surviving the tail of a typhoon, the Surprise finds the Norfolk wrecked on a reef by the same typhoon and her survivors encamped on an island. Aubrey, Mr Martin and some of the crew take Maturin ashore for surgery; he is in a coma since hitting his head during the typhoon. Just as the surgeon from the Norfolk, Dr Butcher, prepares to operate, Maturin wakes from his coma. A heavy storm blows the Surprise away. Relations between the two marooned groups are tense, because some of the crew on the Norfolk were British mutineers and deserters in 1797 aboard HMS Hermione; they will be hanged for desertion and mutiny if they are returned to the Royal Navy. One admits this to Bonden. Aubrey tells the American Captain Palmer that he and his crew are now prisoners of war. Both groups are eager to leave this island.

The book takes place during the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic. At this point Philadelphia is considered to be the largest city located in North America. The city is hit with an incurable and unknown disease which kills about 50% of the people effected. The author Jim Murphy describes a disease called the yellow fever and how it affected the residents of Philadelphia. In the novel he highlights the heroic roles and actions that the Philadelphia free blacks took in order to fight this deadly disease, and how it causes a constitutional crisis that leads president George Washington to leave the city of Philadelphia. The cure for the disease was not found until centuries later.\nDr. Benjamin Rush: Developed a radical treatment process for the yellow fever disease which involved withdrawing blood from patients and giving patients mercury and the root of a poisonous plant.\nMayor Matthew Clarkson: The only government leader who stayed to deal with the issues that were going on in Philadelphia when the plague was taking place.\nPresident George Washington: Was involved with foreign affairs when the plague struck and was out of touch with the government affairs for the time length of six weeks while the plague was taking over Philadelphia.\nThomas Jefferson: Was the Secretary of State when the plague struck Philadelphia.\nEdmond-Charles Gen\u00eat: Was the French Ambassador who wanted the Americans to help France with their revolution.\nThe Reverend J.

It has been stated that Jim Murphy created an impeccable book that draws the reader in while at the same time creating fear. He is able to describe how horrid this period of time was for history with solid research and amazing facts. \"In a lavishly illustrated book, containing maps, newspaper columns and period illustrations, Jim Murphy unflinchingly presents the horrors of the event as well as its heroes\" states Anita Silvey. Kirkus Reviews named it Starred Review and found the book to be \"A mesmerizing, macabre account...powerful evocative prose... compelling subject matter...fascinating discussion...valuable lesson in reading and writing history. Stellar.\"\"Leisurely, lyrical tone...Murphy injects the events with immediacy...archival photographs...bring the story to life...comprehensive history.\" was Publishers Weekly's opinion about the work. Murphy spotlights the heroic role of Philadelphia's free blacks in combating the disease, and the Constitutional crisis that President Washington faced when he was forced to leave the city \u2014 and all his papers \u2014 while escaping the deadly contagion.\nSibert Medal\nNewbery Honor\nNational Book Award Finalist\n2010 Margaret Edwards Award - one of five titles contributing to Murphy receiving the award.\nSilvey, Anita (18 January 2004). \"An American Plague By:Jim Murphy\".

Spartacus is a 1951 historical novel  by American writer Howard Fast. It is about the historic slave revolt led by Spartacus around 71 BC. The book inspired the 1960 film directed by Stanley Kubrick and the 2004 TV adaptation by Robert Dornhelm.\nThe novel changes between third-person omniscient past and present tenses. The  narrative structure  is based on several members of the Roman ruling hierarchy (Crassus, Gracchus, Caius, and Cicero) who, using the past tense, are shown meeting to relate tales of the events in Spartacus's life and uprising. The tales are told in the present tense directly by the narrator, with details going far beyond the Romans' possible knowledge.  The novel deviates from and extends known historical facts.  In particular, the real Gaius Gracchus died about ten years before the birth of Spartacus.\nThe novel's central theme is that man's most basic universal values are freedom, love, hope, and finally life. Oppression and slavery strip these away until the oppressed have nothing to lose by uprising. Oppressive systems are held together by political systems. Spartacus stands as an eternal symbol of how man must fight against political systems that oppress man's values:\nA time would come when Rome would be torn down\u00a0\u2013 not by the slaves alone, but by slaves and serfs and peasants and by free barbarians who joined with them.\nAnd so long as men labored, and other men took and used the fruit of those who labored, the name of Spartacus would be remembered, whispered sometimes and shouted loud and clear at other times.\nHoward Fast self-published the novel in the United States during the McCarthy era in 1951. He began writing it as a reaction to his imprisonment for charges stemming from his earlier involvement in the Communist Party USA. He had refused to disclose to Congress the names of contributors to a fund for a home for orphans of American veterans of the Spanish Civil War.  He was imprisoned for three months in 1950 for contempt of Congress.\nThe final page of the first edition describes some of his difficulties in publishing:\nReaders who may wonder at the absence of a publisher's imprint are informed that this book was published by the author. This was made necessary when he learned that no commercial publisher, due to the political temper of the times, would undertake the publication or distribution of the book. Its publication was made possible by hundreds of people who believed in the book and bought it in advance of publication, so that the money would be forthcoming to pay for its printing. The author wishes to thank these people with all his heart. He is also most grateful to the many people who helped with the preparation of the manuscript, with the editing of it, and with the design and manufacture of the book. He hopes that for some future edition, at a time when it would not subject them to danger and reprisal, to be able to name these people and extend personal thanks to each in turn.\nThe cover illustration of the first edition is by African-American artist Charles White.\nIn the 1991 paperback version (ibooks, distributed by Simon & Schuster; ISBN\u00a00-7434-1282-6), the author has a short introduction, \"Spartacus and the Blacklist\", which expands on the conditions surrounding the writing and publishing of the work.\nSpartacus, 1931 novel by Scottish writer Lewis Grassic Gibbon.\nThe Gladiators, Arthur Koestler's 1939 novel on Spartacus.\n\"Spartacus: An Interview with Howard Fast\".

A Deadly Wandering is based on a series of articles in The New York Times that Richtel wrote in 2010, garnering him a Pulitzer Prize. His 2011 novel Devil's Plaything dealt with themes of personal technology and its sometimes harmful impact on society.\nOn September 22, 2006, shortly after being denied a Mormon mission due to premarital sex, nineteen-year-old Utah college student Reggie Shaw is texting and driving with his girlfriend when he crosses the yellow lines on the highway west of Logan, Utah. He causes a chain-reaction accident that kills James Furfaro and Keith O\u2019Dell, two rocket scientists headed to work. Unharmed, Shaw attempts to call 911 but the call didn't go through. A state trooper that comes to the scene said he witnessed \u201ca collision so violent it popped out the passengers\u2019 eyeballs.\u201d Despite initially denying he was texting and driving, and his parents vehemently standing behind him, Shaw eventually admits to it when faced with damning evidence. Richtel examines the police investigation and Shaw's prosecution, which was a test case in terms of accident litigation. Shaw ended up serving several weeks in prison for negligent homicide.\nRichtel intersperses this narrative with scientific studies of attention and the human mind. He details the history of cognitive neuroscience, from its beginnings in World War II in assisting pilots to not become overwhelmed by technology, to its current applications with MRI studies. Richtel cites a study that claims motorists are impaired for 15 seconds after they text. He explains how cell phone companies initially denied texting and driving was a dangerous activity. Indeed, Richtel notes, not a single state banned the practice when the accident occurred. Eventually, Reggie Shaw becomes a prominent advocate against distracted driving. He is forgiven by the families of the scientists he killed.\nRobert Kolker of The New York Times gave the book a positive review. He wrote, \"As an instructive social parable, Richtel\u2019s densely reported, at times forced yet compassionate and persuasive book deserves a spot next to \u201cFast Food Nation\u201d and \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d in America\u2019s high school curriculums. To say it may save lives is self-evident.\" Kolker notes that, \"The most powerful question raised by \u201cA Deadly Wandering\u201d is a simple one: If we know texting and driving is so bad for us, why do we still do it?\" The Christian Science Monitor said that the book is a \"keen and elegantly raw \u2013 like a tooth-crackingly crisp photograph that bleeds at the edges \u2013 story surrounding this disaster is not just a morality tale about texting and driving, but also a probe sent into the world of technology, examining the way it is outstripping our capability to keep up with it, and how we as a culture are feeding bullets into the techno-gun and playing with it.\" Daniel Dyer of The Plain Dealer liked how Richtel changed narrative focus \"to keep us continually apprised of the actions of his various principals and supporting players.\"\nKolker, Robert (September 25, 2015). \"Attention Must Be Paid: 'A Deadly Wandering,' by Matt Richtel\".

After being separated from the world by ten years, the Gatekeepers and their closest allies finally come back through the mysterious doors. Jamie is the first to appear, in a church called St Boltoph's, somewhere in the north east of England, located in a strange and seemingly hostile village. There is no electricity nor power of another kind and the townspeople are weary and hostile. He meets a girl named Holly, and a strange man who calls himself \"the Traveller\", who takes them under his wing. In the village, Jamie is having trouble fitting in. He finally tells Holly the truth about him and the Five, and although she initially doesn't believe him, she eventually sees the truth, especially when one of her villagers, teacher Anne Keyland, betrays them all to the police, who kill everyone in the village and then obliterate the village itself. The Traveller saves Jamie, and Holly comes along, despite the Traveller disagreeing with this idea.\nMeanwhile, the executives of the now nigh-all-powerful Nightrise Corporation are in the ruins of New York attending a business conference named the \"Endgame\" where, it is said, they will be given their rewards. But these \"rewards\" are really to become leading soldiers of the Old Ones. A riot ensures in the United Nations and twenty of the executives are killed. All but one of the rest are consigned to training camps in the country to prepare for the final outcome. The one who survived is Jonas Mortlake, who is given, by the new chairman, the task of winning Scott over to the Old Ones, to allow them to capture Matt.\nScarlett and Richard have arrived in Egypt, and are rescued by Albert Remy, an agent of the Nexus, and they are taken to Tarik, a freedom fighter who is fighting against the Old Ones' chief servant in Egypt, Field Marshal Karim El-Akkad. Richard discovers that the children who were supposedly injured by El-Akkad's forces and are being treated in a Nexus-run hospital are child soldiers, used by Tarik to fight the ruling military. Sickened, Richard also discovers that the vehicle being used to escort him and Scarlett out of Egypt is equipped with explosives, in a plan to kill them and El-Akkad in the same attempt. He changes the license plates and other details of the bomb jeep with another, and he, Scarlett and Remy leave the fort, meeting a driver who is really El-Akkad. Tarik detonates the bomb, unaware of Richard's actions. Richard and Scarlett kill El-Akkad, but Remy is mortally wounded and dies soon after, on the road to Dubai. \nScott and Pedro come through a door in Italy, where they are immediately captured by the police working for the Old Ones and imprisoned in a castle. Scott is taken to meet Jonas Mortlake, who was at the Endgame Conference, but he was the chief executive officer of Nightrise (as well as the son of Susan Mortlake) so he wasn't recruited for the militia. He assigns Scott the task of betraying the others, if he breaks Pedro's finger to prove his loyalty. Scott, drugged and weary, does so. But later when he meets Pedro he is shocked by his action. He telepathically forces Jonas to break his own finger and they leave. But Mount Vesuvius erupts and all but destroys Naples. Pedro only gets on a ship through a servant named Giovanni who saves him, but Pedro has to swim through human sewage to get out of the castle where he and Scott were imprisoned.\nMeanwhile, Matt and Lohan have arrived in Brazil, and Matt is encouraging Lohan to sell him for money, and then steal him back. He sells him to a drug lord and rescues him. Matt visits the dreamworld in the library where the Librarian gets the book of Matt's life out for him to read all the way through. Matt does and is shocked at his future which reveals him being betrayed, then tortured and killed. But he knows it is destiny so he goes along with it, knowing that it will work. First, he needs to get to Antarctica, to the frozen wasteland of Oblivion, and to do this, he needs to find one of the doors.\nScarlett and Richard bury Remy and take his wallet, before arriving at Dubai Airport and meeting First Officer Zack Martins, formerly of Emirates, now a buyer for the childish and insane Sheikh Rasheed al Tamin. His captain, Larry Carter, stole some of Rasheed's treasure and is set to be executed. Richard creates a plan to break Larry out of prison, by going to Rasheed's favourite haunt: a casino. There, Scarlett bets the contents of Remy's wallet on roulette and wins, but Rasheed notices, disqualifies her, and invites her and Richard to his palace for dinner. During the meal, Rasheed plans to force Scarlett to marry him, threatening to kill Richard if"

In an author's note, Levy writes, \nEarly in the process of planning The Perfect Thing, I decided to organize it by aspects of the iPod, instead of in a chronological narrative. One day, while, appropriately, shuffling songs on my iPod, I had an idea that could spiritually link my book to its subject: I would shuffle the chapters. Each one would be written to stand on its own and not require others as antecedents... By shuffling my chapters, I hope to spotlight these issues--and to have some fun, another thing that squares with the spirit of the iPod.\nPerfect\nIdentity\nOrigin\nCool\nPersonal\nDownload\nShuffle\nApple\nPodcast\nCoda\nLevy starts the book with a timeline of the iPod, running from October 2001 to October 2005. He then writes in a shuffled set of chapters, focusing on the \"perfect\" aspects of the iPod\u2014the origins and the idea of the iPod, its ability to create an identity and a familiar community, its coolness factor, how it made music personal for individuals, and how it changed the music industry with Apple's iTunes Store.\nThe book includes quotes, interviews, and anecdotes with such individuals as Apple's co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs; Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates; cultural anthropologist at the University of Utrecht and noted \"Professor of Cool,\" Dr. Carl Rohde; founder of MP3.com, Michael Robertson; and many others.\nPublishers Weekly wrote: \"Combining upbeat reportage about the device's origins and development with higher-minded ruminations about its place at 'the center of just about every controversy in the digital age,' he explores how the iPod 'set the technology world, the business world, and especially the music industry on its head.'\"\nCory Doctorow of Boing Boing wrote: \"The impact of \"shuffling,\" of carrying your collection in your pocket, of putting digital music in the hands of info-civilians who never would have put up with the crummy design and arcane interfaces of the early competitors\u2014these are big stories that will play out for decades yet, and Levy's book does the best job I've yet seen of categorizing and taking the measure of these great shifts.\"\n\"Nonfiction Review: 'The Perfect Thing: How the iPod Shuffles Commerce, Culture, and Coolness\".

Soros describes his career in finance and provides his perspective on investing and global finance, politics, and what he views as the new world order.  He follows his life from Holocaust survivor and student of philosophy and finance at the London School of Economics, to his emergence as one of the more successful and powerful traders of the twentieth century.  Soros tells the story of his extraordinarily successful Soros Fund Management, and its $12 Billion dollar Quantum Fund, which for years produced a remarkable average annual return of 30%.  \nSoros describes \"Black Wednesday\", the time he made 1 billion dollars selling the British pound short, as well as the roughly $600 million he once lost speculating on the yen in February of 1994.  In simple terms, \"Black Wednesday\", was a formal devaluation of the British pound by around 20% against the dollar, the German Mark, and other currencies that took place on September 16, 1992. Soros, in the two weeks prior to September 16, on behalf of his hedge fund, and backed by both large large bank loans and a multitude of the fund's co-investors, acquired and sold around ten billion British Pounds. Other private investors, not associated with Soros's funds, followed suit.  After the pound dropped around 10-20% against the Mark, Soros, on behalf of his hedge fund, claimed to have made an estimated profit of around 1 billion dollars.  Balancing the criticism by many British citizens and economists that this move damaged the English economy, Soros advocates noted that he had invested heavily in British securities during this period, and during the nationalization of industries imposed by Margaret Thatcher, Soros's funds were heavily invested in English industries including Jaguar automobiles and British Telecom.  More specifically, Soros biographer Robert Slater estimated that Soros invested $500 million in British stocks shortly before \"Black Wednesday\" in the first few weeks of September 1992, based on the assumption that Great Britain's equities would rise following the devaluation of its currency.\nPerhaps most significantly, Soros explains the motivation he had in creating his philanthropic organizations, the Soros Foundation and his Open Society Institute.  Through these organizations, Soros initially worked to begin Open Societies in the Soviet Union, and in Eastern European countries, many still under Communist rule.  Among other efforts, Soros and the Open Society Foundations gave grants to further scientific research in Russia, spent close to $1 billion founding Central European University with multiple campuses in Eastern Europe, and worked to further freedom of speech.  Soros's foundations and philanthropy extended to his native Hungary, then Poland, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, and the Balkans. By the early 90's Soros's foundations were active in eighteen countries including Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and the new states of Ukraine, Belarus, Moldava, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkistan.\nMost notably in Russia during a period of Glasnost which included more transparency with America and Western Europe in the 1990s, Mikhail Gorbachev recommended Soros for the Nobel Prize for giving grants of $100 million to Soviet scientists when the state had no money to pay them, giving $100 million to free the teachings of Humanities in Universities from their adherence to Marxism\u2013Leninism, and most notably spending $100 million for all thirty-three regional Universities in Russia to connect to the Internet.  Soros, on behalf of his foundations, spent millions to combat a virulent strain of drug-resistant tuberculosis that was advancing in Russia, most notably in its prisons.\nAs Soros has admitted, at times a small portion of his contributions may have been pocketed by their recipients or used privately by those who should have been administering his foundations, and others have found his positive changes to be cut short when a new Presidential administration or opposing political movement gains power.   In China in 1989, though he made a valiant effort to support economic growth and back anti-Communist dissidents, the Open Society Foundation was forced to close due to the rigidity of its Communist bureaucracy and opposition from leaders such as Chairman Deng Xiaoping who associated the group with a competing political faction.  In China in 1987, as in several other Communist nations, Soros's Open Society Foundation was erroneously suspected of being tied to efforts of America's Central Intelligence Agency to undermine Communism"

                "description": "What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception is an autobiographical bestseller by Scott McClellan, who served as White House Press Secretary from 2003 until 2006 under President George W. Bush. The book was scheduled to be released on June 2, 2008; however, excerpts were released to the press a week before publication. The book quickly became a media sensation for its candid, insider's critique of the Bush administration and ran as a leading story on most top news outlets days after the content became public. It was listed as a number-one bestseller by the New York Times and on Amazon.com when it first went on sale.",

McClellan harshly criticizes the Bush administration over its Iraq war-making campaign, though he writes in detail about his personal admiration for President Bush. He accuses Bush of \"self-deception\" and of maintaining a \"permanent campaign approach\" to governing, rather than making the best choices. McClellan stops short of saying Bush purposely lied about his reasons for invading Iraq (in fact, stating flatly that he did not believe that Bush would intentionally lie), writing that the administration was not \"employing out-and-out deception\" to make the case for war in 2002, though he does assert the administration relied on an aggressive \"political propaganda campaign\" instead of the truth to sell the Iraq War.  The book is also critical of the press corps for being too accepting of the administration's perspective on the Iraq War, and of Condoleezza Rice for being \"too accommodating\" and overly careful about protecting her own reputation.\nMcClellan's transformation from White House Press Secretary to prominent critic was a shock to most political observers, and his public changeover \"startled Washington\".\nThe Bush administration issued a statement about the book through McClellan's successor, Press Secretary Dana Perino, who said, \"Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House. We are puzzled. It is sad. This is not the Scott we knew.\" The administration additionally took exception to the claim that they had misled the nation in the \nlead-up to the war in Iraq, as Perino said, \"He's suggesting that we purposely misled. There is no new evidence of that.\"\nIn response to the claims made by McClellan in the book, Congressman Robert Wexler (D-FL) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is the Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, have called upon McClellan to testify under oath in front of Congress. McClellan testified publicly under oath before the House Judiciary Committee in July 2008.\nMcClellan has responded by stating that his role as Deputy White House Press Secretary during the lead-up to the Iraq War was not to make policy, contending that he was inclined to give the Administration the \"benefit of the doubt\" like most Americans, and that he did not fully appreciate the circumstances until after leaving the \"White House bubble\" and being able to reflect with a more clear-eyed view of events.\nWhile McClellan's book advance was for a comparatively low $75,000, What Happened reached the number-one position on the sales chart of Amazon.com, and its printing was quadrupled to more than 300,000 copies by its publisher, PublicAffairs.\nBumiller, Elisabeth (2008-05-28). \"In Book, Ex-Spokesman Has Harsh Words for Bush\".

Existence of a new Clinton work was first revealed in February 2017, but at the time it was billed as a volume of essays centered around the author's favorite sayings, with only some allusions to the campaign. Financial terms of that work, which had no announced title, were not publicly disclosed but industry observers expected her monetary compensation to be large. The new purposing of the work and its thematic substance were revealed in July 2017. After the title was announced, it was parodied with memes on Twitter.\nThe New York Times wrote that the stated aim of the book was to offer an intimate view of what it was like for Clinton to run as the first female presidential candidate from a major party in United States history, in an often vicious and turbulent campaign. This is her third memoir, following Living History in 2003 and Hard Choices in 2014; advance publicity for the work said it would be her \"most personal\" yet and quoted from her words in the book's Introduction: \"In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I've often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net. Now I'm letting my guard down.\" Clinton promised a new level of candor as a major theme of the initial publicity surrounding the book. The work was also said to include some self-help ideas about how to get past highly unpleasant experiences.\nWhat Happened is a first-person account dedicated to \"the team that stood with me in 2016,\" and one of its chapters is largely a list of everyone who worked on her campaign. It is organized into six main parts, entitled: Perseverance, Competition, Sisterhood, Idealism and Realism, Frustration, and Resilience. Each part has from two to five chapters within it.\nAfter the introduction, the book opens with a scene from the United States presidential inauguration of 2017, attended by Clinton and her husband, where she watched President Donald Trump take office. She begins:\nDeep breath. Feel the air fill my lungs. This is the right thing to do. The country needs to see that our democracy still works, no matter how painful this is. Breathe out. Scream later.\n\nIn the next chapter, \"Get Caught Trying,\" she starts with her reasoning for running: \n I ran for President because I thought I'd be good at the job. I thought that of all the people who might run, I had the most relevant experience, meaningful accomplishments, and ambitious but achievable proposals, as well as the temperament to get things done in Washington.\nFurther in, she elaborates: \nIt was the chance to do the most good I would ever be able to do. In just one day at the White House, you can get more done for more people than in months anywhere else. We had to build an economy that worked for everyone. We had to take on serious national security threats. These issues were already on my mind all the time.... I knew I would make the most of every minute. Once I started thinking about it that way, I couldn't stop.\n\u2014\u2009What Happened, p. 52\nIn the book, she defends her campaign, saying they were economical with travel expenses, snacks, and office supplies. \"Our national campaign staff [were] living and working on a tight budget...\" She revealed that the average donation was $100 and that the majority were from women.\nShe also describes campaigning in hostile areas of the country, like Mingo County, West Virginia, \"Ground Zero for the coal crisis.\" She describes being taken aback by the level of anger she was met there with. She wrote, \"This wasn't just about my comments in one town hall. This was something deeper.\"\nIn the book, also, Clinton tries to explain the combination of factors that led to her electoral loss, including James Comey, Vladimir Putin, Mitch McConnell, The New York Times, NBC, WikiLeaks, the  American media as a whole, sexism, white resentment, Bernie Sanders and his supporters, Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and herself, specifically her comments on putting \"coal miners out of business\" and labeling her opponent's supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\". \nShe noted that President Obama worried that extending the handover process after Trump's win would be bad for the country. She wrote \"After so much hand-wringing about Trump undermining our democracy by not pledging to accept the results, the pressure was on us to do it right. If I was going to lose, the President wanted me to concede quickly and gracefully. It was hard to think straight, but I agreed with him.\"\nThe book contains a number of Clinton's policy proposals,"

Similar to short stories, character sketches in journalism became popular among 1960s writers and in this era focused on providing a realistic picture of a type of person, but differed in that sketches did not tell stories of particular individuals.

Especially if you\u2019ve got braces and bony\nfingers and a bump the size of a goddam coconut on your head.\nAnd especially if you\u2019re fourteen. Because\u2014ask anyone.\nFourteen is shit.\u201d\nTold in third-person point of view, limited to the protagonist, Gear is about a mid- to late-1960s 14-year-old boy named Ronnie. Ronnie wants to be cool and accepted because he is often made fun of by his peers. The kids call him \u201cRailroad Tracks\u201d and \u201cBrooklyn Bridge\u201d for the metal braces in his mouth. He is sketched as funky looking: skinny with acne; curly, balding hair; \u201cbent fingers;\u201d and \u201ca face that looks like the end of a watermelon.\u201d At home, he feels unwanted and as though his parents take him for granted. \nRonnie lives in vain to become more like those who are popular \u2013 those the tone implies he thinks are more desirable and attractive to the world. He buys a pair of bell-bottom pants and has his mother tailor the cuffs to look cool. Thinking the new pants will make him more of a man, he heads out with the assumption that life will be better. The style of clothing Ronnie selects is typical of the style of a 1960s mod, as he is called by the narrator.\nAlthough the setting is not specified, one can assume that it is somewhere in the northeastern United States, probably New York City, as the boy\u2019s nickname is \u201cBrooklyn Bridge\u201d and his pants were priced in dollars. It is stated in the story that Ronnie takes the bus to Fordham Road, a well known street in the Bronx, hometown of Goldstein. Several literary elements are used to progress the sketch, the most important being symbolism, subtext, point of view, tone and mood. The narrator speaks from a limited, third-person point of view, but is able to illuminate the scene with powerful symbols.\nThe tone is juvenile and impressionable, as Ronnie imagines himself in the likeness of Brian Jones, a popular, attractive icon of the 1960s hipster, and guitarist for the Rolling Stones, moving like him in the mirror and putting an unlit cigarette in his mouth and a handkerchief in his pants to look cool and feel macho.\nSilas Marner is a book Ronnie is reading that is about a weaver, Silas, who is framed for murder by his best friend, William, after stealing from a church and getting arrested. He is then forced to leave his home town to avoid false punishment. William marries the woman with whom Silas was in a relationship. Silas works and saves up everything he earns only to have it stolen by a man named Dunstan. He is lonely and desperate for better fortune and through his lack of inclusion, feels his life is meaningless. When he takes in a child who's drug-using mother died in the snow, his life begins to change. He raises the child, who grows up to become well-respected. The child is discovered to be the illegitimate child of Dunstan's brother. Through saving the child's life and raising her to become successful, Silas is rewarded with a powerful sense of purpose in life.\nSilas Marner is symbolic of Ronnie\u2019s desire to feel more wanted by others - to feel he has a purpose in life; a mission. Ironically, however, he discards the book under his bed in exchange for watching his turtle eat lettuce, a futile exchange of activity that avails little purpose. Looking into the mirror, he again compares himself to Brian Jones. He puts the bell-bottom pants on - his mother gave him money to buy them the day before as a result of a fight in which he cursed her - and fastens his \u201cboss black boots,\u201d \"boss\" being slang for \"cool.\"  His outfit is symbolic of his desire to become more accepted and have a purpose people appreciate, like Brian Jones and the cool \u201cReign of Terror\u201d kids at the park who get high on glue and smoke cigarettes. They sometimes let him have the model cars with which the glue is included. Again, symbolism reappears as he takes the pants off immediately after thinking about these kids, as if doing so made the outfit subliminally less appealing - like he feels these kids are not really who he wants to be.\nUpon taking off the pants and hanging them on the wall, he re-engages his childlike innocence with a fistful of Oreo cookies, a glass of milk and cartoons on TV. As the sketch clomes to an end, he puts the clothes back on, symbolizing his new machismo confidence. Then he puts an old, unlit cigarette - symbolizing his desire to look cool, but reservations of 'walking the line' - in between his lips and goes out with the assumption his peers will now admire him and he will soon be \"getting laid.\"\nWolfe, Tom; Johnson, E.

Wake is set in 2012. Fifteen-year-old Caitlin Decter has been blind from birth. The Decter family recently moved from Austin, Texas to Waterloo, Ontario after Caitlin's father, Malcolm, received a job at the Perimeter Institute. Caitlin is emailed by Dr. Masayuki Kuroda, a scientist specializing in \"signal processing related to V1.\" He believes that her blindness is caused by her retinas miscoding the visual information and offers to install a signal processor behind her left eye to unscramble the data. The device sends the data to a miniature computer, or \"eyePod\", which reprocesses the signals and returns them. The correct data is sent to her optic nerve, theoretically granting her sight. In duplex mode it sends and receives the signals, and in simplex mode it only sends them. Caitlin and her mother, Barbara, fly to Tokyo for the procedure. Although her pupils now react to light, Caitlin still cannot see. They return to Canada while Dr. Kuroda works on updating the software.\nA bird-flu epidemic with a mortality rate of at least 90% has begun in China. Dr. Quan Li, a senior member of the Communist Party, recommends the President order a culling of ten to eleven thousand people in the infected area with an airborne chemical. The President agrees and launches the Changcheng Strategy, cutting off all telephone, satellite, and wireless communication with the rest of the world, so that word of the culling does not spread beyond China's borders. Wong Wai-Jeng, a freedom blogger who is known online as Sinanthropus, attempts to circumvent Internet censorship in China along with many other hackers. Collectively they learn about the bird flu outbreak. Many days after enacting the Changcheng Strategy, Zhang Bo, the Minister of Communications, convinces the President to restore communications. The moment they are back up, Sinanthropus posts a blog, informing the world of the bird flu outbreak and the culling. He is tracked down by the police and, while attempting to flee, breaks his leg and is captured.\nThe first software update Kuroda attempts is a partial success. Although Caitlin can still not see the outside world, it enables her to visualize the World Wide Web while the update downloads when the eyePod is in duplex mode. Dr. Kuroda speculates that the data being transmitted between the eyePod and his server in Tokyo is being interpreted by her optic nerve, allowing her to see this. He decides to travel to Waterloo to work with Caitlin on the implant more directly. In the interim, he suggests sending the retinal feed from her eyePod to his Tokyo server through Jagster, a fictional search engine, so that he can monitor how she reacts to different inputs. He dubs her ability to visualize the internet \"websight\". Caitlin notes that, along with websites and links, she can visualize a background in websight that looks like a chess board. Dr. Kuroda speculates that the background is made up of cellular automata, which Caitlin suggests is caused by corrupted packet loss. Several Zipf plots are run of the cellular automata, which has a negative one slope. The Decters, Dr. Kuroda, and Anna Bloom, a network cartographer, realize that means the cellular automata contain intelligent content, which Anna suggests is secret communications from the National Security Agency. They decide to keep investigating the cellular automata discreetly.\nIn San Diego, California, Shoshana Glick, an ape-language researcher and graduate student, works at the Marcuse Institute, a primate research centre. Hobo, a chimpanzee-bonobo hybrid, communicates by sign language. Doctor Harl Marcuse, the owner of the Institute, sets up a connection with the Miami Zoo. Hobo communicates with an orangutan named Virgil in the first interspecies webcam call. The Marcuse Institute and Miami Zoo agree to announce the chat jointly, but the Miami Zoo leaks word of it to New Scientist, who go to the Georgia Zoo\u00a0\u2013 Hobo's birthplace\u00a0\u2013 for information on him. Georgia Zoo, fearing about the contamination between the captive chimpanzee and bonobo bloodlines, demand Hobo be returned to them so that he can be sterilized. Hobo paints a portrait of Shoshana, surprising everyone at the Institute as it had been believed that chimpanzees could only paint abstractly. Dr. Marcuse theorizes that the communication with Virgil had shown Hobo \"how three-dimensional objects could be reduced to two dimensions.\" The Marcuse Institute decide to record Hobo painting a second time and then go public, believing that the outcry over sterilizing him would force the Georgia Zoo to back down from their"

Janie, is the main character. She tells us what is going on in her life, and she is the most important character. She is able to see into other peoples dreams and whenever she sees someone in class, or riding the bus sleeping, she starts to get paralyzed when this happens.\nCabel Strumheller, Develops a romantic relationship with Janie and is the only one who knows her secret. He does not play a major role until late in the story. He has a covert identity and helps police with drug busting.  He is also plagued with dreams of killing a man who Janie later realizes is his father.\nCarrie Brandt, Janie's best friend, who usually hangs out with the wealthier kids. She is also Melinda's best friend. She has recurring nightmares of the death of her younger brother, who drowned. She becomes entangled in the drug bust in the end.\nMiss Stubin, an elderly woman who lives in Heather Home where Janie works. Also a dream catcher, she helps Janie realize her abilities.\nCaptain Fran Komiski, Cabel's boss, and the one who is in charge of the drug busting operation.\nMelinda Jeffers, Carrie's other best friend, part of the rich kids Carrie hangs out with. She dislikes Janie very much.\nJanie's Mother, who isn't even considered a main character because she is never there for Janie and is always in her bedroom drunk and hungover.\nThe book begins with multiple flashbacks, all leading to Janie's extraordinary powers and where she stands in the present day. Janie Hannagan is an independent, 17-year-old senior at Fieldridge High School, living at home with her alcoholic mother and trying to find ways to fund her future college education. What makes Janie so different from her peers is that she has the involuntary ability to witness others' dreams. Janie discovered this ability at 8 years old, when she was able to witness a businessman's dream of him giving a presentation in his underwear. From that day on, she is somewhat cursed by the long struggle and suffering of being part of others' dreams and nightmares. By taking part in others' dreams, she can see their fears and/or desires. This leads to Janie finding out the secrets of the people around her, but she cannot reveal them because they might think she is crazy. Whenever someone falls asleep within a certain distance of Janie, she automatically becomes paralyzed and blinded, and is sucked into the other person's dream. This distance usually increases significantly if the dream the person is having is a nightmare. People within the dream she enters usually ask her for help, but she is unable to, for she doesn't know how to.  All these incidents become a problem for Janie, especially towards her junior and senior years, because most of the time she cannot control the situation. Her peers, especially Cabel, become suspicious of her strange behavior. While most of her classmates have dreams typical of adolescent anxieties, Cabel,a mysterious loner, has frighteningly morbid dreams that Janie cannot come to terms with.\nAfter several encounters, Janie and Cabel fall for each other on a class trip to Canada, during which time Cabel becomes aware of Janie's strange powers. Although Cabel helps Janie protect her secret, they are unable to maintain a close relationship due to peer pressures, secrecy, and Cabel's growing reputation as a drug dealer to the wealthy and his hanging out at a wealthy girl's house all the time (Shay)...\nEven as Janie and Cabel grow apart, their desire for each other increases. As Cabel seems to fall away from Janie and into the drug trade, Janie realizes things are not always as they seem, and she can learn to use her powers to help others and even serve the community.\nBut all is not as it seems, for Janie soon finds out that Cabel isn't a drug dealer and he was not involved with Shay in any way. But rather Cabel is a sort of underground cop and was on the trail of a major drug bust. Janie is relieved to find out that Cabel isn't doing drugs or hanging out with Shay because he wants to.\nWith the help of Miss Stubin at the Heather Home, Janie discovers that she is a dream catcher and has the power to help others resolve the dreams which are haunting them.\nThe climax of the story comes as Cabel, along with a number of other Fieldridge students and parents, are imprisoned on narcotics charges. Janie witnesses the dream of Shay's father who was the leader in all this drug dealing business. The dream is very intense and lasts for hours and Janie soon becomes completely numb and falls out of her chair. Then Captain Fran ( Cabel's boss) asks Janie what she saw in the dream, hoping that the dream would indicate the location of the drug dealers major stash. Janie describes the dream to Fran"

Tom, a young Chinese American boy has grown up under the care of his eccentric grandmother, Mrs. Lee, in San Francisco. He is her reluctant apprentice Guardian, learning ancient Chinese magic to protect a coral rose. However, upon the arrival of Mr. Hu, a tiger and Mrs. Lee's former apprentice, monsters attack. Mrs. Lee dies protecting Tom and the rose, leaving Mr. Hu the guardian of both Tom and the coral rose. (pg. 25\u201326).\nSafe in Mr. Hu's antique shop in Chinatown, Mr. Hu reveals that the coral rose is actually the phoenix which has the power to transform evil beings into good ones. In ancient Chinese mythology, the creature Kung Kung attempts to use the phoenix to force human beings to obey him. After the Empress N\u00fc Kua defeated Kung Kung, the phoenix chose to return to his egg and await a time of peace when his power would not be misused and the role of the Guardian is created to protect the phoenix. (pg. 39\u201340) However, Kung Kung's lieutenant Vatten and the Clan of Nine (named for Vattens form as a nine-headed-serpent) have followed the Chinese Guardians to America and the phoenix will require both Mr. Hu and Tom to protect it. Tom, however, is afraid to truly take on the role of an apprentice Guardian. (pg. 28).\nMr. Hu guides Tom to Goblin Square, a hidden market for the magical inhabitants of San Francisco's Chinatown. Here they meet Mistral, an old friend of Mr. Hu. Mistral is a Chinese Dragon, an exile from her ocean home for speaking out against the Dragon King(pg. 89\u201390). Mistral agrees to leave her job as a bodyguard in order to help Mr. Hu protect the phoenix.\nThe day after they visit Goblin Square another old friend arrives. Sidney, a zealous salesperson in the form of a flying rat, has seen one of Vatten's spies (pg. 30\u201332, 68). Mr. Hu leaves Tom to wait for Mistral and protect the phoenix. While Mr. Hu is gone, a silver haired girl, R\u00e4v, comes to the door in a fright, looking for sanctuary. Although Mr. Hu has commanded Tom not to open the door, Tom is moved by compassion and lets her in. With the door open, the creature Loo arrives. Another creature from ancient Chinese mythology, Loo is a three-eyed fanged creature with blue skin and red hair. He carries an umbrella that shoots fumes of fatal diseases (pg. 75\u201383). Tom is knocked unconscious and R\u00e4v and the phoenix disappear. When Tom wakes he finds another of Mr. Hu's old friends, Monkey. Monkey, who was cursed for challenging Heaven and who stole his magic staff from the Dragon Kingdom, has also come at Mr. Hu's call to protect the phoenix (pg. 79, 122).\nMr. Hu arrives to find Tom, Mistral, and Monkey amidst the shambles of his shop. Sidney is locked up for a spy and the four leave, Mr. Hu, Monkey and Mistral in their human forms, to find the phoenix.\nThe spy's trail leads them to a run-down house near the ocean where Tom finds R\u00e4v tied up and injured. As they try to rescue R\u00e4v, the floor turns into a pack of red scaled, blue bristled dogs, Hsieh, which overwhelm the would-be-rescuers (99-100). Loo arrives and reveals that R\u00e4v tricked them. Loo traps them in the shrinking room as it fills with water, leaving R\u00e4v and the Hsieh to die with them. Though the tiger's and dragon's strength cannot break the walls, Tom reminds Mr. Hu his grandmother's final lesson, \"use your wits, not your claws\" (pg. 107). Mr. Hu shrinks everyone trapped and Monkey transforms the hairs of his tail into smaller monkeys which guide everyone out through the source of the water. R\u00e4v and the Hsieh are rescued and trapped in a pebble, but not before she reveals that Vatten plans to force the phoenix to hatch early.\nSidney, who has escaped his prison, has found that Vatten has been hiding the phoenix under a hill in the middle of Stow Lake. Though Mr. Hu, Mistral, and Monkey realize that they are too old and will likely not return, they go with Sidney and Tom to find the phoenix. Held up by Loo, Monkey stays behind to fight him while the others proceed to navigate the traps set for them. Mistral is forced to hold back the fanged and clawed tiger-eating unicorn called a Po(pg. 139). Tom, now determined to live up to his grandmother's legacy deliberately springs a trap so Mr. Hu can retrieve the phoenix. Tom is caught in the hair of the venomous, many-headed creature called The Watcher (pg. 140). Even as a ferocious tiger, Mr. Hu cannot stop them. In a last ditch attempt Mr. Hu and Sidney free Tom by setting the Watcher on fire, but they are too late.\nMr. Hu refuses to give up Tom to death, instead bringing everyone to the magical realm of the Empress. The Empress gives some of Mr. Hu's tiger"

He and his men storm and conquer Persian towns and harbours; even the legendary town of Halicarnassus is defeated.

After the victory in Thessaly which ended the first book of the trilogy, Child of a Dream, Alexander and his army march towards the East. The first step of the expedition is to free the Greek cities from the Persian domination in order to establish a strong and united Pan-Hellenic League. Once that is achieved, the target is the Persian Empire itself and its immense Asian territory.\nDuring his military campaign the Macedonian army records numerous victories, including those against the city of Tyre, the Towers of Giza and the legendary Halicarnassus. And it is in the midst of this campaign that Alexander meets the only opponent he believes worthy of his utmost respect: Memnon of Rhodes, the commander of the Greek mercenaries of the Persian army. He struggles in the attempt to defeat Memnon fair and square on the field, but the two end up stalemating each other with strategic cunning. Alexander's friends then suggest to end the confrontation between the two men by ordering to poison the mercenary; Alexander is however disgusted by this outrageous idea as he reckons his opponent is worthy of being defeated with respect and the only way for that to be possible is for Alexander to beat him on the battle field. However, Alexander's friends do carry out the order without Alexander's approval or knowing and Memnon is poisoned within a few weeks. The mercenary's death represents an anti-climactic end to the fantastic strategic battle between the two.\nAfter Memnon's death, Alexander claims his former wife: the beautiful Barsine. The two grow close, which makes Leptine jealous of their relationship. After the Macedonian army finally defeats Darius, thank to a tactically perfect charge, Alexander becomes the sovereign of the greatest Empire that ever existed. Darius offers  terms of unconditional surrender, but Alexander, realizing his position, rejects Darius's initial offer. Darius is thus forced to come back, offering all his territory as far as the Euphrates and a huge ransom. The surrounding nations, seeing Alexander's ruthlessness in victory, fear a similar defeat, and some of their leaders choose to abdicate power to Alexander rather than face him in battle. But the young king is certainly not satisfied: he heads towards Egypt and, after defeating the Tyrian naval force that was attempting to block his way into the country, he finally makes it to the land of the Pharaohs. Here, he is proclaimed Pharaoh and he founds the first of his cities: Alexandria.\nFinally, he crosses the Libyan Desert and after a long and hard journey, he reaches the Oasis of Siwa, where the Oracle of Ammon lies. This tells him that he is not a mere human, but the son of Zeus himself.\nAlexander - the Prince and later the King of Macedon.\nPhilip II of Macedon - The King of Macedon and Alexander's father.\nOlympias - The Queen and Alexander's mother.\nCleopatra - Alexander's sister.\nDarius III - The Persian king.\nMemnon of Rhodes - The commander of the Greek mercenaries of King Darius's army and the formidable Alexander's enemy.\nHephaestion - Alexander's best friend and Macedonian general.\nPtolemy - Alexander's friend and Macedonian general.\nSeleucus - Alexander's friend and Macedonian officer.\nLeonnatus - Alexander's friend and Macedonian officer.\nLysimachus - Alexander's friend and Macedonian officer.\nCraterus - Alexander's friend and Macedonian general.\nPerdiccas - Alexander's friend and Macedonian general.\nPhilotas - Alexander's friend and most experienced and talented general, Parmenion's son.\nLeonidas - Alexander's tutor until the age of 13.\nAristotle - Alexander's tutor in Mieza.\nParmenion - Alexander and Philip's general, Philotas's father.\nCleitus the Black - Officer of Alexander's and Philip's army.\nAntipater - General of Alexander's and Philip's army.\nBarsine - Memnon's beautiful wife.\nLeptine - The girl Alexander rescued.\nPublishers Weekly said that \"the style tends to be somewhat generic\", and was disappointed to find that the author \"gloss[es] over many of the personality foibles that led to Alexander's downfall\".\nFor the first part of the poem, click here.\nChild of a Dream\nThe Ends of the Earth\nValerio Massimo Manfredi\nAlexander the Great\nPhilip II of Macedon\nAmmon\nZeus\n\"ALEXANDER VOLUME II: The Sands of Ammon\". pubhsersweekly.com.

Meanwhile, their father, Fenton Hardy, is working to protect a Coastal Radar Station from sabotage during its construction. They are interrupted by Mary Todd who tells them that her brother, Morgan Todd, is missing and asks Fenton to find him. The Hardy boys and their father decide to team up to both find Morgan Todd and protect the Coastal Radar Station.\nThe Hardy boys travel to Kenworthy College and meet Todd's colleague, Cadmus Quill. A clue leads them to Rockaway, but when it is mentioned they notice strange behavior from Cadmus Quill. While driving to Rockaway they hear a radio report that the radar station has been damaged, so they instead return to Bayport. Their help is not needed so they leave for Rockaway, stopping at Palis Paris to purchase a spinning wheel for their Aunt Gertrude. When they stop in at Tuttle's General Store Mr. Tuttle warns them to keep away from Honeycomb Caves because people have seen strange lights and heard shooting coming from the caves. Instead of leaving, the boys decide to camp at Honeycomb Caves with their friends Chet and Biff.\nAt the caves they meet a strange hermit who invites them for breakfast, then chases them off and even shoots at Frank.  Their adventure continues with Callie Shaw, Iola Morton and Mary Todd trying to get jobs at the Palis Paris, Biff getting knocked out while waiting in the parking lot, Chet's metal detector suddenly exploding and the Hardy boys' boathouse catching on fire.\nThe story concludes with the Hardy boys finding a submarine delivering supplies to the hermit in the caves.  They explore the cave and learn that the caves have an underground passage to Palis Paris where a device was being built to interfere with the new Coastal Radar Station.  The Hardy boys trap the criminals, including Cadmus Quill, in the cave while the State Police enter from the other end and arrest them all.  The Navy is alerted and intercepts the submarine to find Morgan Todd being held hostage.\nThe revised edition was used for an episode of the Hardy Boys animated series and a View Master version also exists.\nWho Wrote the Hardy Boys?

It begins from where its predecessor, The Immortals of Meluha, left off, with Shiva trying to save Sati from the invading Naga. Later Shiva takes his troop of soldiers and travels far east to the land of Branga, where he wishes to find a clue to reach the Naga people. Shiva also learns that Sati's first child is still alive, as well as her twin sister. His journey ultimately leads him to the Naga capital of Panchavati, where he finds a surprise waiting for him. ...",

Continuing from The Immortals of Meluha, Shiva, the fabled savior of the land of Meluha, rushes to save his wife Sati from a Naga who escapes, leaving behind coins with strange engravings. After consulting with Sati's father Daksha and Dilipa, the king of Ayodhya, they come to know that the coin belongs to King Chandraketu, the ruler of the land of Branga in Eastern India. Shiva and Sati travel to Kashi, where a community of Brangas inhabit, in order to get more information on the Nagas. They are accompanied by Shiva's general Parvateshwar, associates Nandi and Veerbhadra, Ayurvati the doctor, and Bhagirath and Anandamayi, the prince and princess of Ayodhya. At Kashi, Parvateshwar is mortally injured in a riot at the Branga community. Their leader Divodas gives Parvateshwar a healing herb which works. Shiva learns from Ayurvati that the herb is only available at Panchavati, the capital of the Nagas. Divodas explains that they get the herbs from the Nagas due to a plague infesting Branga. Shiva decides to travel to Branga and Divodas orders special ships to be made for the journey.\nMeanwhile, Sati gives birth to Kartik, her son with Shiva. As he leaves for Branga, Sati stays back at Kashi to prevent a lion attack on the local villagers. They are helped by a group of Naga soldiers, led by a man and a woman, who assist them in killing the lions. The Naga woman reveals herself to be Kali, Sati's twin sister and the man as Ganesh, Sati's child from her first marriage believed to have died at birth. Both were denounced by Daksha since born with deformities. Kali had two extra functioning hands while Ganesh's face resembled that of an elephant's. An overwhelmed Sati brings back Kali and Ganesh to Kashi.\nAt Branga, Shiva meets the recluse bandit Parashuram, who can enlighten him about the Nagas and the medicine. After defeating Parashuram, Shiva comes to know that he is a Vasudev, the group of scholars who have been guiding him on his journey. Parashuram is also surprised to see Shiva as the fabled Neelkanth; in remorse for his actions, he severs his left hand. He gives the recipe of the medicine to the people of Branga and joins Shiva's entourage. At Kashi Shiva is introduced to Ganesh and Kali by Sati. Shiva recognizes Ganesh as the Naga who attacked Sati and as the supposed killer of his friend, the scientist Brahaspati. Enraged, he leaves Sati and takes up residence at the Branga locality. One day, while playing with Kartik at a local park, Ganesh saves them from a lion attack. Shiva forgives him and together with Sati, confronts Daksha, who confesses to murdering Sati's first husband and denouncing Kali and Ganesh. Daksha blames Shiva for causing distrust between him and Sati; he is asked to leave for Meluha.\nShiva travels to Panchavati under the guidance of Kali, who is the Naga queen and knows how to reach the capital through the treacherous Dandak Forest. On their journey, the entourage is attacked from the river side by a cache of ships containing the weapons of mass destruction known as Daivi Astra that was once forbidden by Lord Rudra, the legendary supreme ruler of India. After fleeing from the attack and safely reaching Panchavati, Shiva and Sati suspect Daksha to be behind this. Kali takes Shiva to a nearby school in the capital, where he finds Brahaspati, perfectly alive and teaching a class.\nTripathi believes that \"Myths are nothing but jumbled memories of a true past. A past buried under mounds of earth and ignorance.\" The book has known characters from Hindu texts as well as those born from Tripathi's imagination, however the characters from the Hinduism do not inherit all of their classical traits.\nShiva \u2013 The main character in the story. He is a Tibetan immigrant to Meluha and the chief of the Guna tribe. On arriving in Meluha and consuming the Somras (a potion), his throat turns blue making him the Neelkanth of the Meluhan legend, which speaks of the appearance of Neelkanth as a destroyer of evil. The Meluhans end up believing that Shiva would be their saviour.\nSati \u2013 A Meluhan princess, she is the daughter of King Daksha. Shiva falls in love with her but could not marry her initially because of a law that considers her to be a Vikarma, an untouchable; he later marries her going against the law.

Winnie Barringer is heartbroken over her close friend Iggie's move to Tokyo, Japan.  However, she immediately takes an interest in the black family that has relocated in Iggie's old house, the Garbers, who have moved to her neighborhood (in an unspecified location) from Detroit, and prioritizes befriending the family's three children, Glenn, Herbie, and Tina, over all else. Her first meeting with the Garber children is awkward and nearly disastrous as she brings up racist subjects inadvertently, but she tries to overcome this by continuing to bond with them, despite several major bumps in the road along the way \u2014 most notably her snobby, prejudiced neighbor Mrs. Landon's callous attempts at running the Garbers out of town because of their race.\nAfter Mrs. Landon and her daughter Clarice leave a sign on the Garbers' lawn telling them they are unwanted and to leave town, Winnie fears that the Garbers will move again, and becomes extremely disappointed in her parents (especially her mother, who appears to demonstrate racism equal to Mrs. Landon's, albeit in more subtle ways) for not standing up for the Garbers.  Eventually Mrs. Landon decides to sell her house and move away herself for no reason other than her prejudice, and attempts to pressure her neighbors into doing the same. This proves to be the last straw for Winnie's father, who thoroughly excoriates Mrs. Landon for her intolerance and tells her there will be no blockbusting in their neighborhood. Although she is proud of her father for telling Mrs. Landon off, Winnie fears that her parents will follow Mrs. Landon's lead, and decides to stow away on a ship to Japan to live with Iggie's family as she would be ashamed of having racist parents.\nIn the end, Winnie's parents decide not to move but only, Winnie's mother tells her, because \"moving is too much trouble,\" not because they wish to befriend the Garbers.  Winnie is again disappointed by her mother's attitudes but is glad to see her father is being more receptive to the idea of being a good neighbor to the Garbers. She also realizes that she herself has a long way to go, and decides to work on becoming a real friend to the Garbers.\nWinifred \"Winnie\" Bates Barringer - A tomboyish girl about to start sixth grade.

Because the novel is divided into chapters, each closely concerned with one of the characters, a summary of the story serves as a character analysis as well.\nChapter One takes place the day before the battle; it is narrated by Lieutenant Palmer Metcalfe, a cocky, 19 year old, aristocrat from New Orleans and a staff officer under Confederate commander Albert Sidney Johnston. He watches as the Confederate army marches through the Tennessee countryside in preparation for a surprise attack upon the Union troops at Pittsburg Landing. His self-satisfaction is evident as he remembers the complicated attack plan he helped draft, and as he thinks back on the struggles Johnston went through in bringing his army together for this decisive blow. The Confederate troops are inexperienced and noisy, and some of Johnston's generals believe the element of surprise has been lost. Johnston, however, insists on fighting whatever the conditions.\nChapter Two is the story of Captain Walter Fountain, an Ohio regimental adjutant in the Union Army encamped at Pittsburg Landing. He is the Officer of the Day and whiles away the Tennessee night by writing a letter to his wife, Martha. Through his thoughts, the reader learns about the Union army's slow but steady advance through Tennessee under the resolute leadership of Ulysses Grant. Fountain is homesick but confident that the war will be over soon. He interacts with the regimental mascot, a dog named Bango. As he commits his feelings and hopes to paper, he begins to notice that the birds and other woodland creatures have become noisier and more agitated. Suddenly hundreds of Confederate soldiers burst out of the forest, charging headlong upon Fountain and the other unsuspecting union troops. The chapter ends abruptly, and the reader assumes that Fountain is killed in the initial assault.\nChapter Three comes from the perspective of Private Luther Dade, a humble rifleman from Mississippi. He is frightened but determined to do his duty as his regiment prepares to join the battle. When the fight does come, Dade is disturbed when he realizes that the mangled corpses of old friends mean no more to him than those of strangers; the new horrors of the day are too much for him to process. He does well in combat but sustains a minor arm wound and is sent to a triage area to wait for a doctor. Hours pass, no doctor shows up, and Dade's arm begins to show signs of infection. He stumbles toward the sound of firing in search of medical attention and soon finds himself in a clearing near Shiloh Church. Others are there; Johnston's staff, gathered around their wounded and dying commander. Dade is transfixed by the drama of the scene, even as he begins to pass out from his wound.\nChapter Four is narrated by Private Otto Flickner, a Minnesota artilleryman. It is the first night of the battle, and Flickner is cowering at the riverbank with hundreds of other deserters. He rationalizes his actions by claiming, \"I'm not scared, I'm just what they call demoralized.\" His search for justification leads him to remember the days events: the shattering surprise attack, one failed attempt after another to stand and fight, the endless concussions of oncoming enemy shells, and finally his running away because \"so much is enough but a little bit more is too much.\" He and the other deserters are jeered at and called cowards by some reinforcements that pass by; their words force Flickner to realize that a coward is exactly what he has been. Without any real conscious effort, he finds himself leaving the riverbank and wandering through the woods looking for his unit. Almost miraculously, he comes upon them getting ready for one last stand. His sergeant, who witnessed his desertion, greets him as if nothing had happened and directs him back to his old gun.\nChapter Five concerns Sergeant Jefferson Polly, a Texas cavalryman serving under Nathan Bedford Forrest. A former seminary student and soldier of fortune, Polly joined the army by reasoning, \"I wasn't any better at being a bad man than I was a good one.\" His mature and cynical perspective tells him that the Confederate army, even though successful on the first day, is fighting a poorly planned and badly coordinated battle. That night, Forrest leads Polly and his squad on a reconnaissance mission to Pittsburg Landing. While there, they see thousands of Union reinforcements disembarking from steamboats; more men in themselves than are left in the whole Confederate army. Forrest and Polly try to alert the high command to the new danger, but fail in the face of confusion and red tape. With the next sunrise, Polly resigns himself to a"

Born in 1933 in Anderson, Indiana, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor was raised in Indiana and Illinois in the 1930s during the Great Depression. During her childhood she was hardly given any toys. Instead, with her parents reading to her every night, books formed a major part of her early years\u2014\"the happiest part\". Her parents read a variety of literature to her, including Bible stories, The Wind in the Willows, and Mark Twain's novels, until she was 14. After she became a parent, she read to her children in the mornings because of their evening activities. At 16, Naylor wrote a short story for a church magazine, and in her early thirties she published her first book. She has published over 100 books. When she wrote and published Shiloh, her 65th novel, she was living in Bethesda, Maryland with her husband Rex, a speech pathologist whom she married in May 1960. She has two adult sons and four grandchildren.\nNaylor writes books for children, teens, and adults. Writing sporadically, Naylor typically takes several years to finish a book. With about 10 notebooks next to her workspace, she writes down story ideas and character traits when she thinks of them. She considered Shiloh to be a deviation from the norm because she finished the first draft in just eight weeks.\nEdited by Jonathan Lanman, Shiloh was published by Atheneum Books on September 30, 1991. The novel has been translated into at least 10 languages: Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Swedish.\nThe novel is set in the small town of Shiloh, West Virginia, where an eleven-year-old boy named Marty Preston finds a stray beagle named Shiloh wandering in the hills near his house. Shiloh follows him home. The dog's name is a tribute to a neighborhood schoolhouse. Shiloh's real owner is Judd Travers, who owns several hunting dogs. Fearing for the dog's safety because Judd drinks and treats his hunting dogs poorly, Marty does not want to return Shiloh. His father insists that Shiloh be returned to his rightful owner and they take the dog home to Judd.\nShiloh returns to Marty who hides him from his family. Concealing Shiloh in the woods in a wire pen he builds, Marty smuggles some of his dinner to the dog each evening. After his mother discovers Marty feeding the dog, he persuades her not to reveal the secret. That night, Shiloh is attacked by a German Shepherd Dog while in his makeshift cage and his family discovers Marty has been lying and hiding the dog. After taking the dog to the town doctor, the family must return Shiloh to his rightful owner by Sunday.\nBefore doing so, Marty travels up to Travers' house to try to convince Travers to allow him to keep Shiloh. Judd does not see Marty approaching, and shoots a doe out of season, which would mean a stiff fine Judd cannot afford. Marty lets Judd know he knows, and attempts to blackmail him out of Shiloh. Judd and Marty eventually negotiate a deal in which Marty will earn Shiloh for 40 dollars, paid with 20 hours of working for Judd. At the end of the first week, Judd says that he will not keep his end of the deal because the evidence of the dead doe has with the passage of time disappeared. Second, the contract that Marty had him sign is worthless in the state of West Virginia without the signature of a witness. Despite Judd's pointed disapproval of his work, Marty continues to work for him. They begin discussing dogs and Judd's father who began physically abusing Judd when he was four years old. In the end, Judd warms to Marty, repents, and lets him keep Shiloh.\nIn a 1992 interview about Shiloh, Naylor said: \"Like a patchwork quilt, a novel is made up of things that have happened to me and things I have heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings.\" Naylor's characters are frequently based on herself and her two sons. She penned the novel following an excursion with her husband, Rex, to visit their friends, Frank and Trudy Madden, in West Virginia. Naylor and Rex were strolling along a river when they discovered a dog in the grass following them. Dejected and frightened, the dog was \"the saddest, most mistreated-looking beagle I'd ever seen\", Naylor later said. Because the dog frequently shuddered and slunk forward on her belly, Naylor suspected she had been abused. On a whim, Naylor whistled and the dog rushed forward, lapping Naylor's face. Tailing them until they reached the Maddens' house, the beagle remained under a tree, her paws cushioning her head during the drizzly afternoon. Naylor cried during her and her husband's"

Fat Chance is a novel that was published in Australia in 1996. It is one of several similar books written by Australian author Margaret Clark.\nLisa. is a teenage girl with symptoms of an eating disorder. She is terrified of being fat and thinks her body is disgusting. Lisa is the protagonist of the story, and it is her narrative we read in Fat Chance.\nDad. Lisa's hard working father. It was his idea to buy the 'Dog Squad' food van and set it up at Jan Juc Beach. He wanted the family to make more money so he could work less hours.\nMum. Lisa's mother. Lisa thinks she is 'fat' and can't understand what her father finds attractive in her mother. Lisa has several conflicts with her mother about the types of food the family eat.\nNick. Lisa's brother. Always teases his sister; calls her 'Lisa lard legs' and other names that upset Lisa. Nick is very popular and many girls in the story think he is 'cute'.\nPenny. Lisa's best friend. She is slim and her family are very health conscious. Pen is seriously injured when a large rock breaks off a cliff and falls on her.\nBrad 'Creepy' Crawley. Always teases Lisa, but seems to secretly like her.\nMike. Another boy who likes Lisa. He is very kind and supportive after the cliff accident.\nShelley. Another one of Lisa's Friends that is slim and healthy. Shelley was injured in the same accident as Penny.\nThe narrative is first-person point of view. The narrator is Lisa Trelaw. The first-person narrative suits the story for a couple of key reasons:\nIt allows the reader to get more emotionally involved in Lisa's story.\nOverall, it gives the text greater emotional pull. This is important in a text that is directed at teenagers. A Third person narrative would be too distant and aloof.\nThe narrative presents the events of the story in chronological order.\nThere are several issues raised in the text, the most notable are:\nPeer pressure - the influence of friendship on a persons behaviour.\nMedia - the role of the media and the influence it has on young minds.\nEating disorders - the impact of eating disorders, like anorexia and bulimia, on the lives of young women.\nFamily relationships - the importance of a supportive and caring family environment for the growth and development of young adults.\nFriends - the importance of friendship in the lives of young adults.\n\nClark, Margaret (1996).

The Two Pearls of Wisdom was first published in Australia on 1 August 2008 by HarperCollins in trade paperback format. It was rereleased under the two different titles of Eon: Dragoneye Reborn and Eon: Rise of the Dragoneye in the Australia, United Kingdom and the United States. It has been released in over five different languages, and in the United States and United Kingdom, it has been released in both hardback and paperback formats. The Two Pearls of Wisdom won the 2008 Aurealis Award for best fantasy novel and was named an honour book in the 2008 James Tiptree Jr. Awards. It was also named a notable book in the 2009 CBCA Awards and was shortlisted in both the 2009 NSW Premier's Literary Awards and the Ethel Turner Prize.\nEon has been studying the ancient art of Dragon Magic for four years, hoping he'll be selected as apprentice to a Dragoneye. Dragoneyes are the human links to the twelve dragons of good fortune, who provide energy to the earth. However, circumstance does not favour Eon; he is a cripple and despised by the trainers and other candidates for the ceremony. They believe his disability embodies bad luck and try to distance themselves, all except a boy named Dillon who is also bullied for his small size. Eon's master, Heuris Brannon, places all his hope and dwindling wealth into his pupil, who is able to see all twelve dragons in minds' sight. This feat is almost unheard of and they pray that the ascending dragon this cycle, who is the Keeper of Ambition, will be drawn by the enormous power demonstrated. However, Eon has a dark secret unbeknownst to all but himself and his master; he is actually Eona, a sixteen-year-old girl who has been living a lie in order for the chance to become a Dragoneye. It is forbidden for females to practice the Dragon Magic; this is due to common belief that the female eye, so practised in looking at itself, cannot see other things in life with true clarity. If discovered, 'Eon' faces a terrible death.\nThe choosing day comes all too quickly and the corrupted Rat Dragoneye, Lord Ido, has seized dominance over the council. He revokes the current practise of ceremonial performances and instead brings back the combat of old. The bloodthirsty crowds approve, but this just adds to the mounting misfortune Eona has to bear. Not only is she given the unlucky number of death, 4, but she has to face off with the one out of the two trainers who bears a grudge against her.\nAgainst the odds, the Rat Dragon chooses her friend Dillon, the smallest of the bunch. Here, it appears as though the protagonist has failed and her master's wealth is all lost; however, as the remaining candidates proceed to the arena to bow to the Emperor, the Mirror Dragon, which has been lost for five hundred years, returns. It chooses Eona, who becomes a Lord due to the absence of a current Mirror Dragoneye. Much to the fury of Lord Ido, all the dragons bow to the Mirror Dragon, including his. This is impossible because his is the ascendant dragon, but the message is clear; the Mirror Dragon, the Keeper of Truth, holds power over all the other dragons. To discourage those who oppose him, Ido poisons Heuris Brannon, Eona's appointed proxy (Eona's adviser until she is of age).\nMeanwhile, the country grows increasingly restless. A battle is about the break out between the Emperor and one of his brothers, High Lord Sethon, who wishes to make a claim for the throne. Lord Ido has allied himself with Sethon and as the Emperor ages, it is clear that the empire will soon be under civil war. The Emperor and his heir, Prince Kygo, attempt to use the return of the Mirror Dragon as a good omen for their reign. This throws Eona into the midst of their struggle for power. She panics, without knowledge as for whom to trust except her close friend Lady Dela (born a man but who is a woman in spirit) and Dela's bodyguard, the islander Ryko.\nTension mounts and soon the battle begins. Eona finds herself in trouble; Ido discovers her true gender and her dragon fades and then disappears altogether. When talking to Dillon she realises that she does not have her dragon's name and thus cannot communicate properly. She consults the palace professor/librarian, who cannot find the red folio of the Mirror Dragon. Eona suspects Lord Ido and realises he has masterminded his own plan, killing all other Dragoneyes and apprentices in a bid for more power. In his library she meets an almost insane Dillon who finds both the red folio and another black folio, detailing how it is possible to create a"

Thomas tries to talk Razov out of this decision, with no success. In Moscow, a radical anti-Western Russian general named Zorin overthrows the civilian government and STAVKA, seizing control of the Kremlin in a swift coup d'etat and taking command of the nuclear communicators.\nIn Washington, National Security Advisor Greg Lambert has dinner with Russian colonel Pavel Filipov, military attach\u00e9 to the embassy in Washington and a close friend of his and his family. As a reward for the US logistical cooperation in the war with China, Filipov reveals that Zorin was the one who convinced the North Koreans to invade the DMZ, in order to preserve Russia's supply lines over the Korean peninsula.\nAs the Russian attack in China unfolds, the US moves to DEFCON 3 as a preventive measure and recalls all its forces back to service: while Lambert is ordered to board Nightwatch with the rest of the cabinet and the Joint Chiefs, Filipov is recalled to Moscow. As the White House is being evacuated, US President Walter Livingston instructs the Secretary of State to warn the Chinese of the impending strike, not wishing to be complicit in Russia's heinous actions. Lambert is wary of the ramifications that decision might entail, but the chaos of the evacuation prevents the President from hearing his advisor's objections.\nIn Los Angeles, US Army Reserve Major David Chandler is ordered to present himself at March Air Force Base to take command of his unit, leaving behind his 9-month pregnant wife, Melissa. As the mobilization continues, Melissa enters in labor and decides to leave the city.\nFrom the Kremlin bunker, General Zorin watches the US evacuation and bomber takeoffs through cable news. Outside, loyalist government forces cut the coup plotters' communications before taking the building by force, leaving Zorin unable to contact the majority of Russia's armed forces, including Razov's nuclear attack in the Far East. After being warned of Russia's incoming nuclear attack by the US, China retaliates by launching their own nuclear weapons against Russia. The warheads directed at Moscow, however, are intercepted by the nuclear-tipped anti-ballistic missile system deployed around the capital. Zorin \u2013sleep-deprived and under the effect of amphetamines\u2013 is convinced that the US took advantage of the confusion and launched a first strike against Russia. Still in control of the nuclear communicators, Zorin orders the ICBM forces in Western Russia to launch at their pre-programmed targets. Their ballistic-missile submarines are not used in the attack, as they are far less accurate than the ICBMs and, thus, only useful for targeting large targets with wide margins of error, such as population centers. The submarines are ordered to maintain their positions in a \u201cbastion\u201d around the Kara Sea, to be used in case Russia orders a second strike.\nOnboard Nightwatch, President Livingston and his staff are informed of the Chinese retaliatory attacks against Russia. At the same time, however, they receive warning of Russian strategic weapons being directed at the United States. Based on their trajectory, the attack is classified as a \u201ccounterforce strike\u201d, directed at the US' strategic military facilities (such as missile silos, major air force and naval bases and NORAD) instead of civilian infrastructure. The President takes the Joint Chiefs' advice and orders its own ICBMs to retaliate in kind against Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces, before their silos are destroyed in the incoming attack.\nIn March AFB, Chandler takes command of his assigned battalion and departs in a commercial airliner, en route to an unknown destination. Minutes later, the base is obliterated by dozens of Russian nuclear warheads. Other targets such as Cheyenne Mountain, Raven Rock, together with the US nuclear silos and major bomber and radar bases, suffer a similar fate. Immediate casualties in the mainland United States are estimated to be between 4.5 and 7 million dead, with hundreds of thousands more left severely injured"

The book follows Eden, a young white female who has been raised in a post-apocalyptic environment. A solar burst has decimated nearly all life on earth, forcing everyone to live underground to avoid \"the Heat\", the world's name for skin cancer. The underground society relies on a racial system where the darker your skin naturally is, the more likely your rate of survival is. Each race is given a name for their station, with whites being named Pearls and blacks being named Coals. Eden spends most of her days in a research assistant position which she achieved due to her father's importance to a secret assignment, and most of her nights hoping that her boyfriend Jamal will one day choose her as his mate. She is often at odds with Bramford, a rich Coal who has hired her father, and occasionally resents the fact that she must wear dark make-up over her body to hide her skin color.\nWhen the scientific experiment run by her father and Bramford is attacked by a political group which believe Pearls to be inferior, Eden barely manages to escape with her father and Bramford. Once outside, Eden discovers that the experiment's purpose was to infuse humanity with the DNA of several animals to ensure a higher rate of survival, and that Bramford was the test subject. Bramford brings Eden and her father to a village hidden in a rainforest which had managed to survive the solar blast, and where he and Eden's father plan to progress further with the experiment. As time passes Eden slowly falls in love with Bramford and discovers his previous relationship with a Pearl, and that he had an albino son with her, something which is seen as unbearable in that society. The preparations for the next experiment are eventually finished, only for the village to come under attack by the same political group. The group is defeated and Eden makes the choice to undergo the infusion of animal DNA with Bramford's son.\nRevealing Eden was published on January 10, 2012 by Sand Dollar Press Inc, a publishing company founded by Foyt.\nIn August 2012 Weird Tales magazine announced that they would publish an excerpt from the novel's first chapter. The magazine cancelled plans to publish the excerpt after readers and authors threatened to boycott the magazine. John Harlacher removed a post by editor Marvin Kaye that defended the book and posted a message apologizing to readers, a move that was criticized by ThinkProgress's Alyssa Rosenberg.\nImogen Russell Williams in the Guardian panned the book, saying \"there is barely a detectable sign of any plot; the whole thing is remarkable for repetition, [and] incoherence\", and also criticised the book's handling of race.\nIn the book racial groups receive titles according to their ethnicity, with characters receiving the name \"Coal\", which some readers viewed as a racial slur.\nFoyt responded to the criticism by stating that she had not intended the book's contents or advertising to be racist, and that her intention was to write a novel addressing the issue of racism, interracial love and global warming.\nNoughts & Crosses series by Malorie Blackman\nFox, Rose. \"Weird Tales Goes Back in Time\".

The persuasion was followed when a middle-aged woman named Christy Pickering asks for Jack's help. Jack finds that Christy has been having a problem with her daughter Dawn, she is dating a man Jerry Bethlehem, about twice her age (or as Christy puts it: \"Old enough to be her father\"). The problem is actually with her PI who has just disappeared. Along the way of looking into Bethlehem life, Jack begins to realize a connection between Bethlehem and the leader(Hank Thompson) of a new movement called the Kickers. It seems that both Hank and Jerry went to the same criminal institute known to take extremely violent criminals, the Creighton Institute. Further investigation leads Jack to finding the detective murdered in ways of a water torture. Jack later finds that not only are Hank and Jerry related by Creighton but also by the newfound mysterious oDNA found there. It comes to Jack that the 'o' stands for the wrong side of his life, the Other. He also finds that Jerry is not his real name, it is actually Jeremy Bolton, a sociopath who was captured for a crime far down in Atlanta, GA: the Atlanta Abortion Murders. After getting Dawn pregnant he starts acting differently, showing his true self to her. Upon finding out of her daughters pregnancy, Christy is found dead, presumed suicide by slashing her wrists. Before her death, Jack investigates on the whereabouts of Dawn's father who has never been mentioned by Christy, only to be enlightened with the truth that Dawn is a rape-baby. Further investigation in the oDNA it is realized that Hank, Moonglow(Christy), and Jeremy are all the children of the mysterious oDNA filled Jonah Stevens.

Bloodline takes place during World War I. John Shaw, a nineteen-year-old, joins the British Army and is sent to the front lines, in the trenches. He works as a communications officer who listens to German radio feeds and translates what he hears. His regiment commander is a man named Quincey Harker, who is the son of Jonathan Harker and Mina Murray from the original Dracula novel.\nHarker is famous for going on raids in the enemy trenches alone at night, and shows several feats of superhuman strength that seem impossible. He is also shown to be cruel to his men. One night a soldier named Private Smith falls asleep on his watch, and Germans invade the trench. As punishment, Harker orders him to be tied to a wagon wheel on no man's land. Private Smith does not die from being shot or shelled, but appears to die of fear.\nOne night, Harker takes John on a night raid to destroy a nest of snipers. However, John gets stabbed in the shoulder with a bayonet. As he passes out, he thinks he sees Harker closely inspecting a large gash in an enemy soldier's throat. Harker carries him back to the trench, which saves his life. John soon becomes very sick with trench fever and believes he is having hallucinations of horrible things involving a hound and beheaded enemy soldiers in no man's land. He is rushed back to England for care.\nJohn is cared for by Mary Seward, the daughter of Dr. John Seward, in the old sanitorium owned by Dr. Seward, which was being used as a hospital during the war. Mary remembers seeing John at a garden party several years before, and wants to help him. She reads his journal that he brought with him to the hospital, and learns about the strange and seemingly impossible feats Harker had done. Meanwhile, John is still delirious from the fever, thinking he is still in the trenches instead of back in England. Soon, however, his fever breaks and he becomes lucid.\nQuincey Harker comes to England, and Lily Shaw, John's sister, invites him to stay at Carfax Hall, John and Lily's house, as thanks for saving John's life. However, Harker begins to seduce Lily, which worries John, as he's seen Harker's cruelty in the trenches. At the same time, Mary and John begin to fall in love, as Mary is John's main nurse at the hospital and they see each other for most of the day. Soon, John is recovered and discharged from the hospital.\nHarker leaves for London to do some work, and when he returns he tells John that his services are needed there for a few days. While he's gone, he proposes to Mary in a letter. When John returns, he goes to Mary's house with a note left for him saying that Lily and Harker have eloped and gone to Transylvania. Dr. Seward learns of Harker's mysterious nature, and realises that he is a vampire. With Van Helsing's bag of vampire slaying tools, John and Mary follow Harker to Transylvania. They also read the collection of journals that is the original Dracula book.\nJohn and Mary reach Castle Dracula several days after Harker and Lily. Once there, they learn that Mina, Quincey Harker's mother, is married to Count Tepes, son of Dracula, and that Quincey is Dracula's grandson. It is also revealed that John Shaw is Quincey's half-brother and Lily is John's half-sister, not his full sister as he always thought, who from birth was chosen to marry Quincey. John and Lily's mother, Rosemary Shaw, who was believed to be dead, is also found living at the castle as a vampire. It is all part of a master plan thought up by Tepes to raise the House of Dracul back to power with John and Quincey both united by Lily.\nLily is shocked to learn that Quincey is a vampire, but is still determined to marry him, as she still loves him. The day before their marriage, however, she kills herself by jumping out the castle window onto sharp rocks below because she was afraid of becoming a vampire, which was part of the master plan, and knew she would never stop loving Quincey, which would make it impossible to leave him.\nMeanwhile, Mina turns John into a vampire after convincing him that it is his destiny. A baby is also taken to the castle for Tepes to feed on so he will be strong enough to go to Quincey and Lily's wedding. Once Mary learns of John's transformation, she asks Rosemary Shaw for help escaping, as Rosemary never liked living as a vampire. Rosemary tells Mary where the baby is being kept and about a secret exit from the castle. Then, Rosemary asks to be destroyed because she doesn't want to live with her daughter dead and her son as a vampire. Mary kills her by pounding a stake through her heart. She takes the baby"

New Watch has the typical structure of the Watch novels, excluding Day Watch. New Watch is divided into three stories - \"Vague objectives\", \"Troublous times\" and \"Vague deeds\". Each story begins with a prologue followed by eight numbered chapters and, changing the usual structure, without an epilogue. Except for the prologues, the events of each story are written in a first person narrative using the voice of the Higher Magician character Anton Gorodetsky, a member of the Night Watch. Events in each of the prologues are written in a third person narrative. The entire novel is written in the past tense.\n\nAnton Gorodetsky, while seeing a foreign colleague off at the airport, encounters an overweight 10-year-old boy named Kesha, who tries to prevent his mother from boarding a plane, claiming that the plane will crash. Anton scans the boy and determines that Kesha is an uninitiated high-level Other, possibly a prophet. Anton influences Kesha's mother not to board the plane.\nMeanwhile, Sergeant Pastukhov of the Moscow police, who gained an ability to see Others (he calls Light Others \"dogs\" and Dark Others \"wolves\") in the first novel, sees an extremely powerful entity whom he labels a Tiger. The Tiger can remove a human's aura, which leaves the person completely indifferent to anything. The Night Watch sends Semyon to initiate the boy, although Geser is very disturbed by the events at the airport, as the plane does not crash as prophesied (unlike predictions, prophecies cannot be changed). Geser calls a meeting of all Light Great Others (including Anton's wife Svetlana and daughter Nadya). They then travel by car (through Twilight) to Kesha's apartment in order to protect him from this strange new creature.\nThe Tiger intercepts them and proves to be more than a match for four Great Mages. It only leaves when Zabulon joins the battle. Anton realizes that the Tiger is a creature of the Twilight whose purpose is to hunt prophets before they utter their first complete prophecy. If this prophecy is heard by a human, then it becomes inevitable. If an Other hears it, then he or she becomes the Tiger's next target. While the Night Watch is attempting to hold off the Tiger, Kesha utters the prophecy in an empty room (a prophet does not hear his or her own key prophecy), causing the Tiger to leave. However, Anton has previously asked Kesha to press the record button on a toy phone. Anton then copies the phone's recording onto a flash drive.\nGeser summons Anton and sends him on a business trip to London to meet Erasmus Darwin, a Dark Other who is a prophet and the grandfather of Charles Darwin. Erasmus was able to trick the Tiger. Erasmus meets Anton and explains how, while his teacher (Zabulon himself) was desperately fighting the Tiger, the young Erasmus shouted the prophecy into an oak. Erasmus then gives Anton a goblet he made from that oak and claims that his prophecy can be revealed, although he refuses to tell Anton how.\nAt a local pub, Anton meets the former witch Arina, who tells Anton that, a hundred years ago, she prevented a prophecy that would destroy Russia from happening (although it resulted in the Russian Revolution). She convinces Anton to go with her to Taiwan to meet Fang Wan-Yang, whose friend was a prophet. Fang reveals that the Tiger can leave the Others alone if they can prove beyond doubt that they will never reveal the prophecy (Fang had to kill his friend and honors his memory by keeping the secret). Arina, who has figured out that Anton has a recording of Kesha's prophecy, steals the flash drive and flees using an untraceable artifact.\nArina once again appears to Anton and explains that the boy's prophecy concerns his daughter and urges Anton to listen to it. Anton gets a call from Erasmus, who reveals that he has made a second goblet and listened to it. Anton hears as the Tiger kills Erasmus. Anton, who has backed up the recording of Kesha's prophecy on his old mini-disc player, listens to it and hears that Nadya, an Absolute Other, is capable of destroying the Tiger and, with it, the Twilight itself.\nAnton decides to destroy Erasmus's oak goblet. At that moment, Nadya, Kesha, and Arina enter the apartment. Instead of destroying the goblet, fire reveals Erasmus's prophecy to the four. The prophecy claims that Nadya will destroy the Tiger and the Twilight. Seeing the Tiger, who is determined to kill them all to prevent the prophecy from coming true, Anton uses Arina's teleportation artifact to flee to her cabin. Arina, who has decided that magic is evil and must be destroyed, tries to provoke Nadya to kill the Tiger.\nAnton walks outside and talks to the"

The second book in the saga of Watches, it is preceded by Night Watch and followed by Twilight Watch, Last Watch, New Watch, and Sixth Watch. Day Watch also stands out of the saga as the only novel in the series not narrated mainly from Anton Gorodetsky's point of view. While the 2006 film Day Watch bears the same name, it is actually a loose adaptation of the second half of the first book in the series, Night Watch, and not an adaptation of this novel.

Walking the streets of Moscow, indistinguishable from the rest of its population, are The Others. These beings possess supernatural powers and can enter the Twilight, a shadowy world that exists in parallel to our own. Each Other owes allegiance to either the Dark or the Light forces. Each side has a patrol to ensure the opposing side follows the rules of an agreement put in place millennia ago. The Light's patrol is called Night Watch and the Dark's patrol is called Day Watch, in accordance with the times when each is active.\nIn the prologue, a woman named Natasha visits a witch and requests that she cast a spell to make the woman's estranged husband fall in love with her again. After Natasha strikes a deal with the witch, members of the Night Watch suddenly arrive and arrest the witch, to Natasha's great surprise and confusion.\nThe story shifts to Alisa Donnikova, a young yet powerful Dark Other, who leaves her house to attend a meeting with her comrades on the Day Watch. The team is on a mission to apprehend and recruit an uninitiated Other, the practicing Dark witch from the prologue who has so far eluded the bureaus responsible for finding and initiating unlicensed practitioners of magic. It seems a routine operation, but when they arrive, the Night Watch team has already made the arrest. A fierce battle ensues, during which Alisa almost dies. Drained of her powers, she is sent to recuperate at a youth camp near the Black Sea. There she meets Igor. The chemistry between them is instant and irresistible, and Alisa finds herself falling in love. But then comes a shattering revelation: Igor is a Light Magician. Alisa suddenly realizes that he was one of those involved in the battle that left her crippled. Had they known what they were, they would have not entered their relationship. But now that they know, Igor (who reacts with rage, feeling he was tricked) challenges Alisa (who reacts with a more depressed note of sadness) to a duel. Alisa allows Igor to choose the site of the battle: off-shore, in the sea. Alisa chooses not to fight back, allowing Igor to magically push her under the water and drown her. She calls Zabulon for help but is shocked to find out Zabulon has planned her death all along. While this is going on, Makar, a boy that had become infatuated with Alisa, swims out to rescue her and also drowns.\nNote: The first scene of this story forms the basis for the opening of the film Night Watch. In the movie, it is Anton (not Natasha) who goes to the witch. Rather than asking that his spouse fall back in love, he asks her to cast a spell that would kill his wife's love child with her adulterous lover (he later learns that the child was actually his own). Both scenes play out in much the same way from there, but the arrival of the Day Watch and subsequent battle do not take place in the movie.\nA man named Vitaly Rogoza awakens while walking through a park late at night with no memory of his past and no knowledge of his identity. Acting on an internal instinct whose source he cannot understand, he is able to protect himself from a werewolf and board a train to Moscow. Once in Moscow and still acting on instinct, he registers his presence as a Dark Other with the Day Watch and proceeds to stumble into a series of seemingly accidental encounters with the Night Watch, often resulting in a Night Watch member dying. He kills Tiger Cub in self-defense as she seeks revenge for him setting a trap that (legally) kills a Night Watch investigator trespassing in his hotel room.\nWhile this is taking place, a Day Watch splinter group named the \"Regin Brothers\" stages an attack on the Inquisition to steal a powerful artifact named \"Fafnir's Talon\". Only four Regin Brothers survive and they head to Moscow. Members of the Night Watch and the Day Watch both learn that the Regin Brothers will be landing in a plane at Moscow International Airport.\nAt the airport, both groups set up camp; the Night Watch tries to thwart the plane's landing while the Day Watch seeks to ensure it proceeds smoothly. Vitaly wanders away from the main group of Day Watch agents and inadvertently stumbles upon the Regin Brothers and two powerful Night Watch members, Gesar and Svetlana. Gesar kills one of the Regin Brothers who attempts to flee, but Vitaly accidentally winds up in possession of the talon. He steals power from Svetlana and creates a portal that allows him to escape to a forest outside Moscow. After meeting some youths camping in the forest, Vitaly returns to Moscow.

In February 1941, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, nicknamed \"Prew\", reports to his new posting at G Company, a US Army infantry unit stationed at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii. Prew is a career soldier (a \"thirty-year man\") with six years' service, an excellent bugler, and a former boxer. He was transferred from his last unit, a Bugle Corps, with a reduction to the lowest rank after complaining that a less skilled bugler, who was a friend (possibly a romantic partner) of the Chief Bugler, had been made First Bugler over him.\nG Company's commanding officer is Captain Dana \"Dynamite\" Holmes, the regimental boxing coach, who chose Prew for his unit because of Prew's past history as a talented welterweight boxer. Holmes thinks that winning a boxing championship will greatly help his chances for promotion and concentrates on building a strong team, offering incentives such as promotions to men who box well. However, Prew swore off boxing after accidentally blinding his sparring partner and even transferred out of a past regiment to get away from boxing. Prew refuses to box for Holmes' team, resulting in his being given \"The Treatment\" by his platoon guide Sergeant Galovitch and others. \"The Treatment\" is a daily hazing ritual in which Prew is constantly singled out for extra drill exercises, unwarranted punishments, and undesirable work assignments in hopes of breaking him down through exhaustion. Despite the abuse, Prew stubbornly refuses to change his mind about boxing.\nHolmes' First Sergeant Milt Warden is a career soldier, who, as the ranking non-commissioned officer, does most of the work of running the company while Captain Holmes is off pursuing either his promotion or women. Warden is both efficient at his job and understanding with the men under him. He comes to respect Prew, and at one point even stays out late getting drunk with him and then makes sure he gets home safely without being disciplined. Warden has also heard that Holmes' beautiful wife, Karen, has slept with a number of other men in his unit and begins an affair with her himself. Warden finds out that Karen's promiscuous behavior is due to her husband's cheating and giving her gonorrhea a few years after their marriage, forcing her to have a hysterectomy as part of the cure. Karen and Warden fall passionately in love, and Warden continues to see her in secret despite the risk to his career and a possible military prison sentence at Leavenworth if her husband finds out. Holmes realizes that his wife is having an affair but does not suspect that it is with Warden. Karen wants Warden to take a training course to become an officer so she can divorce Holmes and marry Warden, something that Warden feels would be improper on top of his already mixed feelings about officers. Over time, the strain of keeping the relationship secret also begins to put a damper on their feelings.\nPrew befriends a new young soldier, Private Angelo Maggio, whose temper and impetuous behavior sometimes get him into trouble. Returning from a drunken night on the town, Prew and Maggio encounter military policemen (MPs), and Maggio fights them. As a result, Maggio is sentenced to a term in the stockade, the local military prison. At a local brothel catering to servicemen, Prew meets a beautiful prostitute, Lorene, whose real name turns out to be Alma Schmidt. Lorene is planning to save the money she makes and use it to establish herself in respectable society back in her Oregon hometown and eventually marry a man who is so respectable that no one would ever believe she had been a prostitute. Over time, she and Prew fall in love, but she refuses to marry him because she does not think he is respectable enough.\nJust before the company's big boxing match, Prew gets into a fight with Private first class Isaac Bloom, one of the boxers, and beats him so badly there is a concern that Bloom can no longer box. However, Bloom boxes and wins his match with a quick knockout. Later, Sergeant Galovitch attacks Prew with a knife while Prew is unarmed. Prew knocks out Sergeant Galovitch but refuses to testify that Galovitch had a knife; as a result, Prew is sentenced to three months in the stockade. While Prew is in the stockade, Bloom, a closet homosexual, commits suicide.\nIn the stockade, Prew sees prisoners routinely beaten and abused by Staff Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson, the prison second-in-command. Prew reconnects with Maggio, who is in the \"Number Two\" barracks where the hardest and most recalcitrant prisoners are kept. Maggio has undergone repeated beatings and solitary confinement in the prison and is now hardened as a result. Prew schemes to be"

It was first published by DAW Books in 1973. The Dray Prescot series is made of several cycles of novels, each cycle essentially forming a series within the series.

The book follows on from the first volume and sees Dray Prescot banished to Earth, arriving in Lisbon. Prescot later takes part in the Battle of Waterloo and eventually travels to India where, shortly after his arrival, he is returned to Kregen through intervention of the Star Lords.\nPrescot arrives on Kregen naked and without arms to save a young couple from an attack by rock apes but the two prove ungrateful and leave without thanking him. The significance of this event was later revealed in The Tides of Kregen but unclear to Prescot at the time. He spends the following days with the Todalpheme, an order devoted to calculate the complicated tides of Kregen. He learns that he has been sent to Turismond, a continent to the west of Segesthes, the scene of most of the first book. He finds himself to the far west of this continent at an ancient, possibly man made canal, the only link between the open ocean and a Mediterranean Sea-like inland see, the Eye of the World. The local Todalpheme are trusted with closing the canal in case of a severe storm through an ancient dam at the western end.\nPrescot, in fear of banishment back to Earth does not dare search out Delia, who does not make an appearance in the novel, sensing that he was returned to Kregen for a specific purpose, and instead opts to travel along the northern shore of the Eye of the World. He is eventually taken captive, enslaved and taken to Magdag to work as a scribe in the local brickworks. He learned that Magdag is the chief city of the northern shore and dedicated to the God Grodno and Genodras, the green sun of Kregen. The southern shore in turn worships the God Zair and  the red sun Zim. The two sides are locked in a long-standing small-scale conflict, with the North defined by an autocratic society ruled by Overlords, employing mostly half-human mercenaries and relying on slaves for labor while the South enjoyes a somewhat freer society, which however is also more intolerant of half-humans. Prescot refuses to take part in a slave revolt and is treacherously send to the galleys as an oar slave, where he meets and befriends a number of southerners. When the galley is attacked by another from the south Prescot breaks free, slows the galley and him and his comrades are rescued. He befriends the ship's captain, Pur Zeniken, a Krozair of Zy, an elite southern fighting order and is taken to Sanurkazz, the holy city of the south.\nDray Prescot rises to become a successful galley captain himself and is eventually chosen to train as a Krozair. After a year of training he is admitted to the order and continues his successful raiding career against the ships from the north. Prescots live is saved in an ambush by two Vallians, Kov Tharu of Vindelka and Vomanus, Delias half brother, unknown to Prescot at the time and send by Delia in search of him. He learns that she has returned to Vallia and send out emissaries in search of Dray Prescot. He takes off to sail to Vallia but the merchant ship he travels on is raided by a galley from Magdag and Prescot is involuntarily taken aboard under the disguise of Drak, Kov of Delphond, Kov being a noble title similar to the Earthly Duke. Prescot spends time with the nobles of Magdag while waiting for a ship to take him to Vallia but also makes contact again with his old slave friends to plot an uprising.\nPrescot trains the slaves and designs and builds new weapons for an uprising. He is betrayed by two of his slave friends out of jeliousy over a slave girl and taken captive, identified as a Krozair but escapes with the help of Princess Susheeng, a noble women in love with him. At the time of the Great Death, when the green sun Gendoras is eclipsed by the red sun Zim the slaves rise up. While the Overloards of Magdag dress in red and perform their rituals the slaves rise up and attack, seemingly victorious. But once again, in the moment of triumph, Dray Prescot is taken away by the Star Lords and he learns later that the rebellion collapsed after his disappearance.\nThe book was first published in English in April 1973. It was first published in German in 1976 as Die Sonnen von Scorpio. The book was also published in Italian as I Soli Di Scorpio. In 2005 the book was published as an E-book by Mushroom Books.\nThe cover of the original US edition was illustrated by Tim Kirk and the second one by Josh Kirby, while the British and first German edition was illustrated by Chris Achilleos and the second German edition was illustrated by Boris Vallejo. The cover of the Italian edition was illustrated by Marco Rostagno.\nThe Suns of Scorpio"

The novel takes place in New York City, where a chemical truck gets into an accident and spills its contents on the street.  Curiously, the trucker has fake identification, and no one seems to have heard of the company name on the truck:  \"Ladies, INC.\"\nLater that evening, Tom Braun and his family go to a party.  Tom gets into a shouting match with his wife, Susan, which their son, Andy, overhears. Andy retreats to his room to pack for a scout camping trip. After Tom leaves the apartment for the night, the women of New York who inhaled the spilled chemicals (including Susan) begin to have severe headaches.  Within a short time, the women are overcome by a desire to have sex with any man they can find.  Finally, the women begin attacking those who have not been similarly affected by the spilled chemicals. In increasingly gruesome scenes, women kill their children, husbands, brothers, etc., and the seemingly few unaffected women of the city.\nAs Tom works with a small band of men to make it home to Andy, Susan first tries to mate with her son, then tries to kill him. Andy hides in a bathroom until an unaffected woman unknowingly saves his life by knocking on the door. The woman is subsequently attacked by Susan and other crazed women. Tom is wounded on his journey home, but manages to severely injure his wife before she can kill their son. Susan then kills Tom, whereupon Andy shoots his mom with several arrows (which he had for his camping trip) to make sure she is not able to recover from her injuries.\nhttp://www.locusmag.com/index/b264.htm\nReviews"

It was Ketchum's first novel and was partially based upon the legend of Sawney Bean, which also inspired Wes Craven's 1977 cult classic horror film The Hills Have Eyes. The novel was released, with many well-known publications attacking its depictions of extreme violence. Critical reaction to it was so strong, in fact, that Ballantine actually stepped back from supporting the novel. Despite initially strong sales, the publisher decided to withdraw it from circulation after the first printings were sold out. ...",

The Black Moth (1921) is a Georgian era romance novel by the British author Georgette Heyer, set around 1751. The Black Moth was Heyer's debut novel, published when Heyer was nineteen. It was a commercial success.\nThe story follows Lord Jack Carstares, an English nobleman who becomes a highwayman after taking the blame during a cheating scandal years before. One day, he rescues Miss Diana Beauleigh when she is almost abducted by the Duke of Andover. Jack and Diana fall in love but his troubled past and current profession threaten their happiness.\nBased on a story she had written for her brother and published with the encouragement of her father, modern critics have considered it a flawed work, they have observed characteristics Heyer included in her later works.\nThe British writer Georgette Heyer (1902\u20131974) was born in Wimbledon, London, and grew up amidst many literary influences. Her father, George Heyer, was an author and former member of the Wimbledon Literary and Scientific Society, and as a teenager she befriended the future writers Joanna Cannan and Carola Oman. In 1921, the elder Heyer encouraged his daughter to publish a story she had written for her haemophiliac younger brother Boris. This story became the nineteen-year-old girl's literary debut and was published as The Black Moth.\nJohn \"Jack\" Carstares, Earl of Wyncham\nRichard \"Dick\" Carstares \u2013 brother of John\nLady Lavinia Carstares (n\u00e9e Belmanoir) \u2013 wife of Richard\nTracy Belmanoir, Duke of Andover \u2013 Lavinia's brother\nLord Andrew Belmanoir \u2013 Lavinia's brother\nDiana Beauleigh \u2013 a young woman from Sussex\nJim Salter \u2013 John's servant\nSir Miles O'Hara \u2013 John's best friend\nFrank Fortescue \u2013 Andover's friend\nThe initial publication of The Black Moth was by Constable, a British company in existence since 1795. Anna Faktorovich describes Constable as a good publisher for the young author; they had a good distribution network and wished to support the development of relatively new genres such as historical romance. Constable arranged for Heyer's novel to be published in the United States by Houghton and Mifflin. The novel was a commercial success. In a contemporary review published in 1921, The Times Literary Supplement deemed the protagonist Jack a \"fascinating hero of romance\" and added that the novel was \"a well-filled story which keeps the reader pleased\".\nThese Old Shades, which came out in 1926, was originally intended to be a sequel to The Black Moth, which would redeem the devilish Belmanoir. But as The Black Moth was a melodrama and a sequel per se would not work in with the plot, she decided to make the new novel stand alone, renamed many characters and made them 'shades' of their former selves for These Old Shades.\nScholars have perceived The Black Moth's influence on Heyer's later works. In an essay published in 2012, K. Elizabeth Spillman describes the novel as \"improbable\" and \"heavily derivative\" but notes characteristics visible in Heyer's other books: the centrality of friendship, seamless action scenes, and a \"natural discourse\" between the male protagonists. The Encyclopaedia of British Writers adds that The Black Moth is \"typical\" of many later Heyer novels, as it has a \"historical setting, aristocratic characters, and exciting plot\". As Jack lives as a highwayman, James Devlin also notes themes of violence, suspense and criminality that appear in other Heyer stories such as The Masqueraders (1928) and Faro's Daughter (1941).\nSpillman also opines that Diana is the only Heyer heroine to be \"unironic [and] untraditional\", as the novel is dominated by the doings of its male characters. Diana is relegated to the background, \"as if the author had little interest in her own heroine\". In later Heyer novels, Spillman writes, the heroines show more agency and will.\nIn 2012, Diana Wallace wrote of similarities between The Black Moth and the works of Jeffery Farnol and Rafael Sabatini, as well as Baroness Orczy's story The Scarlet Pimpernel.\nWomack 2004.\nStade & Karbiener 2009, pp.\u00a0234\u201335.\nByatt 1975, p.\u00a0291.\nNess, Mari (26 June 2012). \"A Bit of Derring-Do and Name Dropping: The Black Moth\".

This decision displeases Richard's spoiled wife, Lavinia.\nA disguised Jack attempts to rob a carriage, but fails when his prey notices Jack's pistol is not loaded. The supposed victim, Miles O\u2019Hara, a Justice of the Peace, arrests Jack. Recognizing Jack is a gentleman, Miles takes him back to his residence to interview him. Miles is delighted to discover the outlaw is actually his old friend, estranged since the gambling incident years earlier.\nLavinia's brother, the Duke of Andover\u2014called the \"Devil\" among society\u2014is sarcastic, darkly humoured and manipulative. He desires Miss Diana Beauleigh, a young woman he met in Bath, and is almost successful in abducting her when a disguised Jack encounters them. The two duel, and Jack triumphs over Andover and frees Diana. Jack is injured and recovers at Diana's home. He does not reveal his identity, instead referring to himself as Mr. Carr. The two fall in love but Jack cannot allow himself to be with her, as he sees himself as a scoundrel and unworthy of her love. He returns to the O'Hara residence.\nRichard becomes upset when Lavinia spends too much time with one of her old suitors, Captain Harold Lovelace. Richard can keep silent no longer and plans to reveal his cheating to a large party, to the dismay of Lavinia. Richard gives her permission to leave him and elope with Lovelace, but she realises she truly loves her husband and sees the error in her spoiled ways. The two reconcile and embrace happily.\nThe Duke of Andover succeeds in kidnapping Diana, desiring to marry her. He brings her back to Andover Court, his estate. Jack learns of the abduction and arrives in time to duel Andover. Richard, Miles, and Andover's brother Lord Andrew arrive and stop the fight right as Jack collapses from fatigue. Richard confesses his role in the cheating scandal, clearing his brother's name. Jack and Diana embrace and get married.

The Black Robe is an 1881 epistolary novel by famed English writer, Wilkie Collins. The book relates the misadventures of Lewis Romayne, and is also noted for a perceived anti-Catholic bias.\nThe structure of the book took on a different form than Collins' more well-known novels such as The Moonstone and The Woman in White. The latter novels used a form in which the narrative of the story is dispersed across many narrators. In The Black Robe, Collins chose to use a series of \"scenes\" to organize the novel coherently. While it is unclear why he chose to divert so radically from a previously successful structure, he had also done this in a previous novel, No Name.\nWriting for The Spectator, E. A. Collins, who was herself a minor novelist, gave the novel a generally unfavorable review. However oddly enough, she recommended the novel for its \"readability.\" The same reviewer complained of an \"unnaturalness\" present in the book, and a lack of development of significant characters.\nIn writing the book, Collins has been accused of perpetuating an anti-Catholic bias common in the late 19th century. Collins himself may have helped fuel this belief, as he wrote to the Canadian Publisher of The Black Robe, regarding the Jesuits, \"We must do all that we can to keep these 'black-robed gentlemen' within due limits.\"\nWorks by Wilkie Collins including the Black Robe - in plain text and HTML at Project Gutenberg\n The Black Robe public domain audiobook at LibriVox\nThe Black Robe (3 volumes).

And maybe everywhere else too, because in the world outside of Spy High, a terrorist organisation is about to send its first explosive announcement:\nChaos is coming!\nThere's a deadly new drug on the streets of America. Drac is instantly and horribly addictive and turns its users into zombies with a desperate craving for blood. Every agent from Spy High has been assigned to discover its source \u2013 even the trainees.\nBut one member of  Bond Team won't be joining the hunt. Jennifer Chen is following a dangerous trail of her own. She's got some private business with a street gang called the Serpents. And it's a business of revenge.\nRebecca Dee has spiked green hair, a lot of body piercings and even more attitude. But that's not what's bothering Jake, Cally and the others. They're more worried about the 'accidents' that seem to happen whenever their new team mate is around. And about where she keeps sneaking off to late at night. Because with strange and dangerous events unfolding in the world outside Spy High, her unusual behaviour is looking like more than just coincidence. In fact, Bond Team are beginning to suspect that Rebecca Dee is a double-agent....\nThings are not looking good for Benjamin T. Stanton Jr. His grades are dropping, his relationship with Lori has hit a major low, and his leadership of Bond Team is in serious doubt. If Ben can't pull things around, he's in real danger of flunking his Spy High exams. And that means one thing \u2013 Mind-wipe. Ben is desperate for the chance to prove himself in a mission situation, but then Bond Team become embroiled in the investigation of a sinister cult and he suddenly wishes he could be anywhere but Spy High. Because this time the suspects aren't just random terrorists, or crazed megalomaniacs \u2013 they include members of Benjamin T. Stanton Junior's own family.\nBond Team have a LOT on their minds. Not only are they about to get their exam results, they're also caught up in Spy High's investigations into terrorism at the Solartech power plant. And while Lori, Jake and the others may be freaking out about the exams, their discoveries at Solartech are way more worrying. Because Bond Team have uncovered a plot that's going to make those exam results seem pretty irrelevant. Because humanity is about to be wiped out, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.\n\nEddie Nelligan is an Irish boy with red hair. The only thing he is good at is making jokes, trying to flirt with all the girls on his team, and sky biking. He is known to be the best in the history of Spy High. He is posted in London, and soon starts facing the threat of a huge terrorist attack poised to stop Britain from joining Europa, a group of European countries.\nLori Angel is a graduate of the Deveraux College, the highly secret school for teenage spies.\nShe is the former girlfriend of Ben Stanton. Until now she has been posted on the coast, mostly surfing and partying. But then a fellow graduate turns up at her apartment. Dead.

And maybe everywhere else too, because in the world outside of Spy High, a terrorist organisation is about to send its first explosive announcement:\nChaos is coming!\nThere's a deadly new drug on the streets of America. Drac is instantly and horribly addictive and turns its users into zombies with a desperate craving for blood. Every agent from Spy High has been assigned to discover its source \u2013 even the trainees.\nBut one member of  Bond Team won't be joining the hunt. Jennifer Chen is following a dangerous trail of her own. She's got some private business with a street gang called the Serpents. And it's a business of revenge.\nRebecca Dee has spiked green hair, a lot of body piercings and even more attitude. But that's not what's bothering Jake, Cally and the others. They're more worried about the 'accidents' that seem to happen whenever their new team mate is around. And about where she keeps sneaking off to late at night. Because with strange and dangerous events unfolding in the world outside Spy High, her unusual behaviour is looking like more than just coincidence. In fact, Bond Team are beginning to suspect that Rebecca Dee is a double-agent....\nThings are not looking good for Benjamin T. Stanton Jr. His grades are dropping, his relationship with Lori has hit a major low, and his leadership of Bond Team is in serious doubt. If Ben can't pull things around, he's in real danger of flunking his Spy High exams. And that means one thing \u2013 Mind-wipe. Ben is desperate for the chance to prove himself in a mission situation, but then Bond Team become embroiled in the investigation of a sinister cult and he suddenly wishes he could be anywhere but Spy High. Because this time the suspects aren't just random terrorists, or crazed megalomaniacs \u2013 they include members of Benjamin T. Stanton Junior's own family.\nBond Team have a LOT on their minds. Not only are they about to get their exam results, they're also caught up in Spy High's investigations into terrorism at the Solartech power plant. And while Lori, Jake and the others may be freaking out about the exams, their discoveries at Solartech are way more worrying. Because Bond Team have uncovered a plot that's going to make those exam results seem pretty irrelevant. Because humanity is about to be wiped out, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.\n\nEddie Nelligan is an Irish boy with red hair. The only thing he is good at is making jokes, trying to flirt with all the girls on his team, and sky biking. He is known to be the best in the history of Spy High. He is posted in London, and soon starts facing the threat of a huge terrorist attack poised to stop Britain from joining Europa, a group of European countries.\nLori Angel is a graduate of the Deveraux College, the highly secret school for teenage spies.\nShe is the former girlfriend of Ben Stanton. Until now she has been posted on the coast, mostly surfing and partying. But then a fellow graduate turns up at her apartment. Dead. Stashed in his rucksack are a series of clues that will lead Lori into the most dangerous situation of her life. And into conflict with a secret society, every member of which is supposed to be dead.\nBenjamin Stanton Jr. is a graduate of the Deveraux College, the highly secret school for teenage spies. His old girlfriend is Lori Angel. When Spy High's old enemy, President Vlad Tepesch of Wallachia, steals an alien device from a Deveraux Moon Colony, Ben's mission is pretty straightforward: Get it back. Standing between Ben and his goal are enemy soldiers, ferocious vampires, a jealous rival, and a singularly disturbing prophecy. Clearly this won't be as"

Freedom for the Thought That We Hate analyzes the value of freedom of speech and presents an overview of the historical development of rights afforded by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Its title derives from Justice Holmes' admonition, in his dissenting opinion in United States v. Schwimmer (1929), that the First Amendment's guarantees are most worthy of protection in times of fear and upheaval, when calls for suppression of dissent are most strident and superficially appealing. Holmes wrote that \"if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other, it is the principle of free thought\u2014not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.\"\nThe book starts by quoting the First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation that limits free speech or freedom of the press. The author analyzes the impact of this clause and refers to the writer of the United States Constitution, James Madison, who believed that freedom of the press would serve as a form of separation of powers to the government. Lewis writes that an expansive respect for freedom of speech informs the reader as to why citizens should object to governmental attempts to block the media from reporting about the causes of a controversial war. Lewis warns that, in a state in which controversial views are not allowed to be spoken, citizens and reporters merely serve as advocates for the state itself. He recounts key historic events in which fear led to overreaching acts by the government, particularly from the executive branch. The author gives background on the century-long process by which the U.S. judicial system began defending publishers and writers from attempts at suppression of speech by the government.\nIn 1798, the federal government, under President John Adams, passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which deemed \"any false, scandalous and malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States\" a criminal act. The Alien and Sedition Acts were used for political impact against members of the Republican Party in order to punish them for criticizing the government. Thomas Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican, was elected the next president in 1800; Lewis cites this as an example of the American public's dissatisfaction with Adams' actions against freedom of speech. After taking office in 1801, Jefferson issued pardons to those convicted under the Alien and Sedition Acts. Lewis interprets later historical events as affronts to freedom of speech, including the Sedition Act of 1918, which effectively outlawed criticism of the government's conduct of WW I; and the McCarran Internal Security Act and Smith Act, which were used to imprison American communists who were critical of the government during the McCarthy era.\nDuring World War\u00a0I, with increased fear among the American public and attempts at suppression of criticism by the government, the First Amendment was given wider examination in the U.S. Supreme Court. Lewis writes that Associate Justices Louis Brandeis and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., began to interpret broader support for freedom of speech imparted by the First Amendment. Holmes wrote in the case of Schenck v. United States that freedom of speech must be defended except for situations in which \"substantive evils\" are caused through a \"clear and present danger\" arising from such speech. The author reflects on his view of speech in the face of imminent danger in an age of terrorism. He writes that the U.S. Constitution permits suppression of speech in situations of impending violence, and cautions use of the law to suppress expressive acts including burning a flag or using offensive slang terms. Lewis asserts that punitive measures can be taken against speech which incites terrorism to a group of people willing to commit such acts.\nThe book recounts an opinion written by Brandeis and joined by Holmes in the 1927 case of Whitney v. California which further developed the notion of the power of the people to speak out. Brandeis and Holmes emphasized the value of liberty, and identified the most dangerous factor to freedom as an apathetic society averse to voicing their opinions in public.\nIn the 1964 Supreme Court case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, the"

On New Year's Day 1975, Archie Jones, a 47-year-old  Englishman whose disturbed Italian wife has just walked out on him, is attempting to take his own life by gassing himself in his car when a chance interruption causes him to change his mind. Filled with a fresh enthusiasm for life, Archie flips a coin and then finds his way into the aftermath of a New Year's Eve party. There he meets the much-younger Clara Bowden, a Jamaican woman whose mother, Hortense, is a devout Jehovah's Witness. Clara had been interested in the unattractive, anti-social Ryan Topps, but their relationship falls apart after Ryan becomes a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses. Archie and Clara are soon married and have a daughter, Irie, who grows up to be intelligent but with low self-confidence.\nAlso living in Willesden, London, is Archie's best friend Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim from Bangladesh; the two men spend much of their time at the O'Connell's pub. Archie and Samad met in 1945 when they were part of a tank crew inching through Europe in the final days of World War II, though they missed out on the action. Following the war, Samad emigrated to Britain and married Alsana Iqbal, n\u00e9e Alsana Begum, or \"Miss Alsana,\" in a traditional arranged marriage. Samad is a downtrodden waiter in a West End curry house, and is obsessed by the history of his supposed but unlikely great-grandfather, Mangal Pandey, a Hindu soldier from Uttar Pradesh, not Bengal, who is famous for firing the first shot of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (though he missed). Samad and Alsana have twin boys, Magid and Millat, who are the same age as Irie. Samad in particular finds it difficult to maintain his devotion to Islam in an English life; he is continually tormented by what he sees as the effects of this cultural conflict upon his own moral character\u2014his Muslim values are corrupted by his masturbation, drinking, and his affair with his children's music teacher, Poppy Burt-Jones. In an attempt to preserve his traditional beliefs, he sends 10-year-old Magid to Bangladesh in the hope that he will grow up properly under the teachings of Islam. From then on, the lives of the two boys follow very different paths. To Samad's fury, Magid becomes an Anglicised atheist and devotes his life to science. Millat, meanwhile, pursues a rebellious path of womanising and drinking\u2014as well as harbouring a love of mob movies such as The Godfather and Goodfellas. Angry at his people's marginalisation in English society Millat demonstrates against Salman Rushdie in 1989 and eventually pledges himself to a militant Muslim fundamentalist brotherhood known as \"Keepers of the Eternal and Victorious Islamic Nation\" (KEVIN).\nThe lives of the Joneses and Iqbals intertwine with that of the white, middle-class Chalfens, a Jewish-Catholic family of Oxbridge-educated intellectuals who typify a distinctive strain of North London liberal trendiness. The father, Marcus Chalfen, is a university lecturer and geneticist working on a controversial 'FutureMouse' project in which he introduces chemical carcinogens into the body of a mouse and is thus able to observe the progression of a tumour in living tissue. By re-engineering the actual genome and watching cancers progress at pre-determined times, Marcus believes he is eliminating the random. The mother, Joyce Chalfen, is a horticulturist and part-time housewife with an often entirely misguided desire to mother and 'heal' Millat as if he were one of her plants. To some extent, the Chalfen family provides a safe haven as they (believe themselves to) accept and understand the turbulent lives of Irie, Magid, and Millat. However, this sympathy comes at the expense of their own son, Joshua, whose difficulties are ignored by his parents. Originally a well-moulded \"Chalfenist\", Joshua later rebels against his father and his background by joining the radical animal rights group \"Fighting Animal Torture and Exploitation\" (FATE). Meanwhile, after his return from Bangladesh, Magid works as Marcus's research assistant on the FutureMouse project, while Millat becomes further involved in KEVIN. Irie, who has been working for Marcus, briefly succeeds in her long-hidden attraction to Millat but is rejected under his KEVIN-inspired beliefs. Irie believes that Millat cannot love her, for he has always been \"the second son\" both symbolically and literally; Millat was born two minutes after Magid. Irie makes Magid the \"second son\" for a change by sleeping with him right after her romantic encounter of Millat. This causes her to become pregnant, and she is left unsure of the father of her child,"

A Clash of Kings depicts the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros in civil war, while the Night's Watch mounts a reconnaissance to investigate the mysterious people known as wildlings. Meanwhile, Daenerys Targaryen continues her plan to conquer the Seven Kingdoms.\nWith King Robert Baratheon dead, his purported son Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne. However, his reign is far from stable, as both of Robert's brothers, Renly and Stannis, have claimed the throne as well. Two regions attempt to secede from the realm: Robb Stark is declared \"King in the North\" while Balon Greyjoy declares himself king of the Iron Islands. The war among these contenders is dubbed the War of the Five Kings.\nStannis Baratheon, publicizing the claim that Joffrey is a bastard, claims the throne as Robert's eldest brother and therefore heir. He is supported by Melisandre, a foreign priestess who believes Stannis a prophesied messianic figure. Renly is supported by the wealthy Lord Mace Tyrell, and has married Mace's daughter Margaery. Robb's mother Catelyn Stark meets with Renly and Stannis to discuss an alliance against Joffrey's family, the Lannisters, but she is unable to reach an agreement with them. Melisandre uses magic to send a shadow to assassinate Renly; after witnessing Renly's death, Catelyn and Renly's bodyguard Brienne of Tarth flee the scene. \nTyrion Lannister, Joffrey's uncle, arrives at the capital city of King's Landing as acting Hand of the King, the senior adviser to Joffrey's reign. Tyrion improves the defenses of the city while jockeying for power against Joffrey's mother, the Queen Regent Cersei. Learning of Renly's death, Tyrion sends the crown's treasurer Petyr \u201cLittlefinger\u201d Baelish to win the Tyrells' support for Joffrey. Catelyn's daughter Sansa, a hostage of the Lannisters, is regularly abused by Joffrey. Riots break out in the city due to Joffrey's cruelty and food shortages caused by the ongoing war.\nRobb wins several victories against the Lannisters while his younger brother Bran rules the Northern stronghold of Winterfell in his absence. Against Catelyn's advice, Robb sends his friend Theon Greyjoy, Balon Greyjoy's son, to negotiate an alliance between the North and the Iron Islands. Theon betrays Robb and attacks Winterfell, taking the castle and capturing Bran and his younger brother Rickon. When Bran and Rickon escape, Theon fakes their deaths. Stark supporters besiege the castle, including a force from the Starks' sometime ally House Bolton. However, the Bolton soldiers turn against the Stark and Greyjoy forces alike, burn Winterfell, slaughter its inhabitants, and take Theon prisoner.\nCatelyn's daughter Arya is taken north posing as a new recruit for the Night's Watch. The recruits are attacked by Lannister forces, and the survivors are taken to the gigantic castle of Harrenhal, which is controlled by Joffrey's grandfather Tywin Lannister. For saving his life during the attack, a mysterious man named Jaqen H'ghar promises to repay Arya by killing three men of her choice. Arya leverages this offer to help Northern forces retake control of Harrenhal. Jaqen gives Arya a mysterious iron coin and tells her to find him in the foreign city of Braavos if she should ever desire to learn his secrets. Arya soon escapes the castle.\nStannis's army launches an amphibious assault on King's Landing in a battle on Blackwater Bay. Under Tyrion's command, the Lannister forces use \"wildfire\" (a substance similar to Greek fire) to ignite the bay, and raise a massive chain across its mouth to prevent Stannis' fleet from retreating. When Stannis's troops storm the gates, it falls to Tyrion to lead the Lannister troops into battle. Stannis's victory seems to be assured, until Tywin Lannister arrives with his army and the Tyrell forces, defeating Stannis. During the battle, Tyrion is attacked and injured by a knight of Joffrey's Kingsguard; by the time Tyrion regains consciousness after the battle, Tywin has assumed the post of Hand of the King.\nA scouting party from the Night's Watch learns that the wildlings are uniting under \"King-beyond-the-Wall\" Mance Rayder. The Lord Commander of the Watch, Jeor Mormont, assigns Jon Snow to a group sent to investigate Mance's aims, led by Qhorin Halfhand. Hunted by wildling warriors and facing certain defeat, Halfhand commands Jon to infiltrate the wildlings and learn their plans."

Temple is split into two stories, both set in South America: One set during the Spanish Occupation of South America and one set in 1999 at the same place.\nThe main focus of the former story is the journey of a monk named Alberto Santiago who becomes a traitor to his country after witnessing Spanish atrocities among the Incan civilisation. Aiding an Incan Prince named Renco Capac to escape, Santiago begins a quest to protect a special Idol - 'The Spirit of the People', an idol carved from black stone with purple veins running through it, actually carved from a meteorite that fell on earth, from the invading Spaniards. Upon his return to Spain, Santiago records his story in a transcript in San Sebastian Monastery in France.\nFour hundred years later, a group of German armed militia known as the Stormtroopers raid the monastery, executing all but one of the Jesuit monks living there, recovering the Santiago manuscript. Meanwhile, another party raids DARPA (The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) headquarters in order to capture a new superweapon known as the Supernova. DARPA sends Colonel Frank Nash to Peru with the aid of NYU linguistics professor William Race to recover the idol before anyone else can retrieve it. Their mission: to retrieve 'the Spirit of the People' (as the natives call it), carved out of Thyrium-261, a nuclear material from a binary star system that came to Earth via a meteorite. Thyrium has the potential to provide virtually limitless clean energy, which can fuel the Supernova, a next-generation weapon of mass destruction with the power to decimate a third of the Earth's surface and bring about Doomsday.\n\nProfessor William Race is a young linguist, working for NYU is approached by a retired Col. Frank Nash, a physicist from the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, to translate a manuscript written in ancient Latin, to find an ancient Incan idol in the South American jungles. Race is told that his brother, Martin Race, was the one who suggested his name, and that his ex college sweetheart, Lauren O'Connor is also accompanying them. Race reluctantly agrees.\nEn route to Peru, Nash provides Race with photocopied pages of a copy of the Santiago Manuscript, which describes the adventures of Alberto Santiago, a Spanish missionary in ancient Peru, whilst also holding the key to the final resting place of a legendary Incan idol, allegedly made of thyrium-261, an element that, when combined with the mass destruction weapon called Supernova, would destroy a third of the Earth's mass throwing it off from its orbit and effectively killing the planet. The team travels to Cuzco, Peru with physicists Troy Copeland and Lauren O'Connor, archaeologist Gaby Lopez, anthropologist Walter Chambers and a team of six Green Berets, including Race's personal bodyguard Leo Van Lewen.\nRace, translating the copy of the manuscript that Frank Nash's team had acquired prior to the flight to Peru, discovers that Santiago and his expedition ended up in Vilcafor, an Incan town deep in the Amazon. However, this was only a partially completed copy, so they didn't know what occurred after Santiago's arrival in Vilcafor. The team decide to use the information in the manuscript to make their way to Vilcafor and find out if the idol resides there.\nAfter arriving in Cuzco, Race's team makes use of Huey helicopters to travel into the Amazon and find Vilcafor, making use of the totem pole clues detailed in the manuscript. After some time in flight, the team finds Vilcafor and lands in the town center. Using a Nucleotide Resonance Imager (NRI), the team discovered a source of Thyrium-261 to the west of Vilcafor, and headed for the source.\nThis led them to a finger of rock in the middle of a canyon, on which sat an ancient temple, which Lopez and Chambers deduced to be pre-Incan. Nash decided to blow open the temple's entrance with C-2 plastic explosive. However, as this was happening, the two Green Berets left to guard Vilcafor, Corporal 'Doogie' Kennedy and Corporal 'Tex' Reichart, were ambushed by a German assault team. The Germans took the town then with use of 'Apache' attack helicopters took the temple from Nash's team, taking them prisoner and putting them in the town.\nThe Germans decided to open the temple themselves. However, this unleashed the inhabitants of the temple known as rapas. Rapas, big cats likened to jaguars and previously considered no more than myth, emerged from the temple to first decimate the German temple team then descended on Vilcafor to tear apart the rest of the Germans. Nash's team, separated, had to take drastic option to avoid their own deaths, but were able to"

Among the factions, the primitives are a eugenics project for Garry Uvarov who hopes to lengthen the lives of humanity without the use of Anti-Senescence (anagathic or life-extension) technology. The Superet faction relies heavily on failing technology and maintains a totalitarian government which refuses to acknowledge the existence of other decks on the ship; the virtuals remain aloof.\nUpon their arrival, their end of the wormhole is destroyed leaving them trapped in the future. They observe that the entire universe is full of red stars, so the stars have aged far faster than expected. The Great Northern makes contact with Lieserl, who explains her observations of the photino birds. The birds do not just exist in our sun but every sun, helioforming them to an amenable habitat. The Xeelee, masters of baryonic matter, have known about the photino birds and have been striving to thwart them. The baryonic universe is doomed, but the Xeelee create a 'Ring', an escape hatch. A cosmic string is made into a loop and creates the phenomenon of the Great Attractor. The function of the Ring is to create a Kerr metric at its centre, which creates a portal to other universes. Whenever humans have met up with the Xeelee and pursued war, this was merely an annoyance since the Xeelee were thinking on a larger scale about more potent enemies. The crew of the Great Northern and Lieserl discover the folly of their species.\nA Xeelee nightfighter is discovered in Callisto, a reference to the later story \"Reality Dust\", and it is rigged to piggyback the Great Northern to the Great Attractor.  Fifty days later, they discover that the Xeelees' project has been destroyed, but a recently awakened virtual of Michael Poole shows Spinner-of-Rope, a primitive, how to pilot around the fragmented cosmic strings and travel into the past, using a closed time-like path. These last humans return to the Ring, in an era in which it was not destroyed; the Xeelee allow them through, and they briefly attempt to pick universes and find sanctuary in another younger universe, after passing through the Ring, and get to work on starting a new world.\nMichael Poole remains in our universe and witnesses the deaths of the last stars, and the decay of the last protons\u2014the final victory of the dark matter lifeforms over the baryonic Xeelee and lesser races. Eventually, his consciousness disperses, and history ends.\n\"Ring (Xeelee Sequence #4) by Stephen Baxter\". Goodreads. goodreads.com.

Rohmer, Glynne Walley. After 4 teenagers mysteriously die simultaneously in Tokyo, Kazuyuki Asakawa, a reporter and uncle to one of the deceased, decides to launch his own personal investigation. His search leads him to \"Hakone Pacific Land\", a holiday resort where the youths were last seen together exactly one week before their deaths. Once there, he happens upon a mysterious unmarked videotape. Watching the tape, he witnesses a strange sequence of both abstract and realistic footage, including an image of an injured man, which ends with a warning revealing that the viewer has one week to live. Giving a single means of avoiding death, the tape's explanation ends suddenly, having been overwritten by an advertisement. The tape has a horrible mental effect on Asakawa, and he does not doubt for a second that its warning is true.\nReturning to Tokyo with no idea how to avert his fate, Asakawa enlists the help of his curious friend Ry\u016bji Takayama, an apparent psychopath who openly jests that he engages in rape. As soon as Asakawa explains the story, Ry\u016bji believes him and insists on seeing the tape. Asakawa shows it to him, and he agrees that there is a powerful aura around it, and asks Asakawa to make him a copy to study at home, which Asakawa does.\nRacing against the deadline, both men begin investigating the tape. By following the imagery from the tape, Ry\u016bji deduces that the rapid strobe seen during certain sequences show the recording device was \"blinking\". The duo then connects this, as well as the significance of certain tape images, and learn of Sadako Yamamura, a young woman capable of technopathic feats (such as projecting mental images onto televisions) who mysteriously vanished 30 years previously. Believing that Sadako is connected to the tape, Asakawa also soon learns that, after carelessly leaving the tape in his home, his wife and infant daughter viewed the tape and now have 1 week to live.\nLearning of an isolated sanatorium Sadako frequented when her father contracted tuberculosis, Asakawa arranges a meeting with Nagao Jotaro, a doctor at the now-closed hospital. Recognizing him as the injured man from the tape sequences, Ry\u016bji aggressively presses Dr. Jotaro for answers; the doctor, buckling under pressure, explains that he was infatuated with Sadako and raped her in the woods near the hospital. Infecting her with smallpox that he unknowingly contracted, Jotaro was injured during a struggle (during which he learned Sadako was intersex), resulting in the doctor throwing Sadako into a nearby well before crushing her with rocks.\nBelieving that Sadako's rage and psychic powers resulted in the images projected onto the tape, Asakawa and Ry\u016bji head for the well where she was killed. Figuring that the well is located beneath the lodge where the tape was located, the duo locates the well. Asakawa lowers himself inside, finding Sadako's remains. Recovering and giving her remains a burial, Asakawa passes his deadline, confirming that his curse has ended. When Ry\u016bji dies of a heart attack the next day, however, the true nature of the tapes are revealed: Sadako's rage caused her psychic powers to combine with the smallpox virus in her body, creating a paranormal phenomenon that is activated when the tape is viewed. Demanding the viewer replicate the tape, the curse is propagated like a virus through tape copies, sparing anyone who copies it; since Asakawa duplicated the tape at Ry\u016bji's request, he now must make his wife and daughter do the same.\nKazuyuki Asakawa: The book's protagonist, he is a Tokyo newspaper reporter whose reputation was somewhat tarnished in the past in connection with a fad for UFOs and ghosts. He has a wife, Shizuka (the Vertical, Inc. English translation of the novel incorrectly renders her name as Shizu), and daughter, Yoko.\nRyuji Takayama: Asakawa's friend whom he enlists to help him solve the riddle of the tape. He was a doctor but later became a philosophy professor of a famous university due to the time the story occurred. Being of an odd mental disposition, and is also something of a genius, Ry\u016bji usually stated that the purpose of his life is to gaze at the end of humanity. Ry\u016bji also claims to be a rapist, although whether these claims are true or not is unclear, as it may be a hoax used to befriend the quiet Asakawa. He was actually a lonely person who struggled to live peacefully within society. Ry\u016bji has even more significant roles in the sequels Spiral and Loop.\nShizuka and Yoko Asakawa: Asakawa's wife and daughter respectively. When"

Published purportedly without Bradstreet's knowledge, Bradstreet wrote to her publisher acknowledging that she knew of the publication. She was forced to pretend she was unaware of the publication until afterwards, or she would have risked harsh criticism. Bradstreet wrote the poem \"The Author to Her Book\" in 1666 when a second edition was contemplated. The book was published, without Bradstreet's knowledge, by the Rev. John Woodbridge.

Many critics believe that Bradstreet was a woman who pushed the boundaries of her religion. Fortunately for her, she did not suffer negative consequences like Anne Hutchinson, who was also a Puritan writer of her time. Other writers such as Ann Stanford and Samuel Eliot Morison have also critiqued The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America. Stanford felt that in Bradstreet's second edition of The Tenth Muse, she used her poetry to go against the Puritan society and should have been labelled as \"rebellious\" and \"independent\". On the other hand, Morison praised Bradstreet for being one of the most superior poets of her time.\nThe entire original title is: The Tenth Muse, lately Sprung up in America, or Several Poems Compiled with Great Variety of Wit and Learning, Full of Delight, Wherein especially is Contained a Complete Discourse and Description of the Four Elements, Constitutions, Ages of Man, Seasons of the Year, together with an exact Epitome of the Four Monarchies, viz., The Assyrian, Persian, Grecian, Roman, Also a Dialogue between Old England and New, concerning the late troubles.

Soldier, Ask Not is a science fiction  novel by American writer Gordon R. Dickson, published in 1967 by Dell Publishing company. It is also the title of a novella which appeared in the October, 1964 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine.  The shorter work constitutes about one third of the novel.\nIt is part of Dickson's Childe Cycle series, in which mankind has reached the stars and divided into specialized splinter groups. It takes place at roughly the same time as Dorsai!, and a few characters appear in both books. Themes from the rest of the cycle are echoed here, particularly the actions of a key person, like Paul Formain, Cletus Grahame and Donal Graeme in the other novels, who can drastically affect history due to his ability to analyze and influence the behavior of others. Unlike the other protagonists, however, Tam Olyn is no hero.\nIn the late 23rd century, humanity has settled fifteen younger worlds around nine stars, including Earth's solar system. Although Old Earth remains populated by the traditional variety of \"full-spectrum\" people, the younger worlds have developed \"splinter\" cultures, taking very divergent paths and developing specialized cultures. Most notable of these are: the Exotics, philosophers, mystics and psychologists; the Friendlies, puritan faith-holders who supplement the meager production of their rocky worlds by hiring out as mercenaries; and the Dorsai, true professional soldiers, highly skilled and expertly trained. Other worlds have specialized in different ways, in the sciences, mining, agriculture or commerce.\nThe primary medium of interplanetary trade is in personal service contracts. The worlds are divided into the \"loose\" worlds, where individuals maintain some control over their contracts, and the \"tight\" worlds, where personal contracts may be bought and sold regardless of the wishes of the individual worker.\nThe title refers to a hymn sung by soldiers of the Friendly worlds.

Tactics of Mistake is a science fiction novel  by American writer  Gordon R. Dickson, first published as a serial in Analog in 1970-1971. It is part of Dickson's Childe Cycle series, in which mankind has reached the stars and divided into specialized splinter groups. The fourth book written, it is chronologically the second book of the cycle, occurring roughly a century after Necromancer, and a century before Dorsai!. The primary character, Cletus Grahame, is the ancestor of the key characters in later works: the twins, Ian and Kensie Graeme, and their nephew, Donal Graeme. (The spelling of the last name was changed in intervening generations.)\nThe key theme here is the development of the Dorsai culture, and the creation of the Dorsai military model which makes their soldiers the best among all the settled worlds. It also shows the growth of the separate planetary cultures and their evolution to independence from Earth.\nIn the late 22nd century, humanity has settled fifteen younger worlds around nine stars, including Earth's solar system. Although Old Earth remains populated by the traditional variety of \"full-spectrum\" people, the younger worlds have developed \"splinter\" cultures, taking very divergent paths and developing specialized cultures. Most notable of these are: the Exotics, philosophers, mystics and psychologists; the Friendlies, puritan faith-holders who supplement the meager production of their rocky worlds by hiring out as mercenaries; and the Dorsai, professional soldiers. It has been less than a century since settlement of the other worlds began, and the younger worlds are still highly dependent on Earth.\nTwo primary factions control Earth, the Western Alliance and the Eastern Coalition. Although they are not openly at war on Earth, they support opposing factions in wars on the other planets. While the Western Alliance provides soldiers to these clients, the Eastern Coalition tends to send advisors, weapons and materials, relying on local soldiers. Readers in the early 1970s could not help but notice the parallel to the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union in general, and the Vietnam War in particular, but that analogy breaks down as the story develops.\nAlgis Budrys gave the novel a mixed review, saying that although \"there is no denying the power of this kind of storytelling, for all that logical analysis yields some stuff that can sound either ludicrous or gamy.\"\nCletus Grahame, a Lieutenant Colonel of the Western Alliance\nEachan Khan a Colonel of the Dorsai, formerly a General in the Eastern Coalition\nMelissa Khan Grahame Eachan's daughter, later Cletus' wife\nMondar an Exotic from Kultis\nDow deCastries Secretary of Outworld Affairs for the Eastern Coalition\n\"Galaxy Bookshelf\", Galaxy Science Fiction, September 1971, pp.146-47\n\"Library of Congress Online Catalog\".

Holy Deadlock is a 1934 satirical novel by the English author A. P. Herbert, which aimed to highlight the perceived inadequacies and absurdities of contemporary divorce law. The book took a particularly lenient view of the need for divorces, which it characterised as \"a relief from misfortune, not a crime\", and demonstrated how the current system created an environment which encouraged the participants to commit perjury and adultery. The book was a major element in the popular debate about the liberalisation of divorce law in the mid-1930s, and helped pave the way for the 1937 statutory reforms.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, English law did not allow for divorce by mutual consent, but rather required proof of adultery, or violence by one party; misconduct by both parties could lead to the divorce being refused. Divorce was seen as a remedy for the innocent against the guilty. So this had the weird consequence, castigated in the book, that if one spouse had committed adultery, they could be divorced, but if both had, they couldn't \u2013 unless the court chose to exercise its discretion. That discretion was itself covered by peculiar rules of its own. To add a further hurdle, the law strictly prohibited \"collusion\" by the parties. This could extend to any sort of negotiation between them. An official\u2014the King's Proctor\u2014was charged with seeking out any evidence of the parties working together to secure a divorce.\nMany couples of the time chose to petition on the grounds of adultery, even when no adultery had been committed. In this situation, a popular solution was what was known as \"hotel evidence\": the man and an uninvolved woman would travel to a seaside resort for a weekend, and go around publicly and ostentatiously as husband and wife. In the morning, they would take great care to be observed by the chambermaid in bed together when she brought in their breakfast. The pair would return home, and when the case came to court the maid would be called on to give evidence as a witness to this fictitious \"adultery\". After the trial, there would then be a six-month waiting period until the decree nisi granted at the trial was made absolute, and any misconduct by the \"innocent\" party in this time\u2014or any evidence of collusion coming to light\u2014could annul the divorce.\nIn effect, to secure an amicable divorce, one or both of the couple would have to commit perjury several times over\u2014and potentially be liable for criminal penalties in so doing. Whilst the courts would often turn a blind eye to it, this was by no means guaranteed, and a system which virtually mandated perjury was felt by many to be scandalous.\nDivorce law reform had long been one of Herbert's \"small causes\", for which he agitated in the pages of Punch. His first attempt to bring this particular cause to a broader audience was a play, The White Witch (1924), concerning a couple in a divorce suit who both protest that they had not committed adultery. The play was a failure, and closed after six weeks; Herbert felt that the \"fatal\" problem had been that \"nobody made love\" in the play. Arnold Bennett wrote that he was \"very disappointed indeed\" by it, and E. V. Lucas wrote that he loathed \"adultery discussions in public. The theatre ... should be jollier than that\".\nHerbert had written three novels, with varying degrees of success.\nThe Secret Battle (1919), a critically acclaimed war novel, sold poorly on its original publication but was republished in 1930, and went through five subsequent editions.The House by the River (1920) was a little-noted crime novel, which began to introduce elements of comedy into a tragic storyline,.The Water Gipsies (1930), a story about canal life, was a broad success, which went on to sell a quarter of a million copies and attract comparison to the works of Charles Dickens. By 1932, he was contemplating a fourth novel to capitalise on this last success; his editor at Punch, E. V. Knox, encouraged him to put aside his theatrical work to focus on writing it.\nHe chose to make another attempt at writing on the theme of divorce reform. During a sailing holiday around Brittany with Sir Edward Spears and his wife Mary Borden in late 1932, he filled a notebook with the outline of what was to become Holy Deadlock.\nBefore the novel was published, however, he took up the theme in one of his Misleading Cases, \"Not a Crime\". This was first published in Still More Misleading Cases (1933), and unusually does not seem to have been published in Punch beforehand. In this, he presented an innocent couple, married in haste during the First World War, who wished to divorce. The reader was told that after a farcical series of events had spun the case out, the decree nisi was refused"

The Woodlanders is a novel by Thomas Hardy. It was serialised from May 1886 to April 1887 in Macmillan's Magazine  and published in three volumes in 1887. It is one of his series of Wessex novels.\nThe novel was later classified by Hardy for the Wessex Edition of his works in the primary group of \"Novels of Character and Environment\". Yet despite it being regarded as one of Hardy's major novels, the novel is 'something of an anomaly', in comparison with the tragic depth of both its predecessor The Mayor of Casterbridge and its successor Tess of the D'Urbervilles.\nThe novel reflects common Hardy themes: a rustic, evocative setting, poorly chosen marriage partners, unrequited love, social class mobility, and an unhappy, or at best equivocal, ending. As with most his other works, opportunities for fulfilment and happiness are forsaken or delayed.\nThe Woodlanders marks the beginnings of controversy for Hardy's novels. At this point in his career he was established enough as a writer to take risks, especially in the areas of sexuality, such as marriage, divorce, marital fidelity, and the use of unconventional plots and tones, and seemingly immoral conclusions. Hardy's portrayal of sexual morality led to him being identified with the 'Anti-marriage league'.\nThat marriage is less-than-exclusive in the novel is highlighted most clearly through the words and thoughts of Grace Melbury; as heroine and betrayed wife of an unfaithful husband, she ought to represent the moral centre, but she openly acknowledges sexual and marital infidelity. On Fitzpiers' illness, she welcomes Mrs Charmond and Suke Damson into the bedroom with the unsubtle, \"Indeed, you have a perfect right to go into his bedroom [...] Wives all, let's enter together!\" When abandoned by him, she calls nature \"bountiful\" in so soon replacing him with another, tender form of \"undiluted manliness\" - Giles.\nThe novel draws attention to the double standards prevailing in relation to sexual morality - when Fitzpiers returns after the death of Mrs Charmond he is outraged when he is led to believe (wrongly) that Grace has been cohabiting with Winterborne. In fact Winterborne has sacrificed his life to preserve Grace's good name. Fitzpiers clearly believes that Grace owes him fidelity even after he has had affairs with two women and deserted her.\nThe affair with Suke Damson shocked his first publisher who insisted that the line \"it was daybreak before Suke Damson and Fitzpiers returned to Little Hintock\" be taken out of the first edition. The fact that Fitzpiers has extra marital relations with two women demonstrates his callous and exploitative character. In particular, although Mrs Charmond may be said to be a seasoned woman of the world who can take care of herself, Suke Damson is a simple village girl who is dazzled by Fitzpiers and whom he never has any intention of marrying. As a result of the affair her prospects of a happy marriage are ruined - she and her husband Timothy Tangs have to emigrate to New Zealand to escape the rumours and gossip (but not before Tangs tries to injure Fitzpiers with a man trap)\nThe Woodlanders also contains many poetic descriptions on the natural world, the countryside and the changing seasons.\nFlorence Emily Hardy, his second wife, recorded that in 1874 Hardy \"put aside a woodland story\", which ten years later evolved into The Woodlanders. It was intended to be the successor to his 1874 Far from the Madding Crowd, but he laid the novel aside to work on other things.\nHardy eventually decided to return to his \"woodland story\" after the editor of Macmillan's Magazine asked for a new serial in October 1884. It was published as a serial in this magazine and in the American Harper's Bazaar in 1887, followed by a three-volume first edition in March of the same year.\nThe Woodlanders was widely praised. It was declared by the Saturday Review in April 1887 to be, \"the best [novel] that Hardy has written\", by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, \"his loveliest if not his finest book\", by William Lyon Phelps, \"the most beautiful and most noble of Hardy's novels\", and by A. Edward Newton, \"one of the best novels of the last half century\". The late nineteenth century English author George Gissing read the novel in March 1888 \"with much delight\" but felt that the \"human part is...painfully unsatisfactory\". \nThe novel remained a personal favourite of Hardy's. Newman Flower recounted that Hardy named it to him as his \"favourite novel\", and 25 years after its publication, Hardy wrote that, \"On taking up The Woodlanders and reading it after many years, I like it as a story best of all.\"\nSoon after the novel's publication, Hardy was approached by Jack Grein and Charles Jarvis for permission to adapt it for performance in 1889.

The book \"develops a favorite theme of Baum's, the emptiness and artificiality of fashionable life.\" Throughout Baum's literary canon, but most notably in the Oz books and the Aunt Jane's Nieces series, Baum stresses the fundamental values of simplicity and naturalness as opposed to \"sophistication.\"\nCharacters in the book express pronounced skepticism about the pretensions of high society. Patsy argues that \"all decent folks\" are members of society \u2013 and when another character calls this \"communism,\" Patsy agrees, \"Perhaps so.\" She continues,\n...certain classes have leagued together and excluded themselves from their fellows, admitting only those of their own ilk. The people didn't put them on their pedestals \u2013 they put themselves there. Yet the people bow down and worship these social gods and seem glad to have them.\nBeth's initial attitude is so negative that her cousin Louise calls her a \"rank socialist.\"\nThe story begins with a scene between the cousins' patron, Uncle John, and his sister-in-law, Louise's mother. Mrs. Merrick insists that the girls are suffering a disadvantage in not being active in \"Fashionable Society.\" Though Uncle John knows that his sister-in-law is a vain and foolish woman, her criticism hits him in his most vulnerable spot; he cannot stand to think that his beloved nieces are lacking any of the good things in life. Uncle John capitalizes on a business contact with Hedrik Von Taer, a fixture of the Four Hundred, the social elite of New York City. The broker asks his daughter Diana Von Taer to sponsor the nieces' debut; Diana, well aware of John Merrick's millions and his importance to her father's business, agrees, as long as the girls are not \"impossible.\"\nDiana calls on the cousins individually; she is struck with Louise's sweetness and classic femininity, Patsy's liveliness, and Beth's beauty (though Diana and Beth dislike each other cordially on first acquaintance), and finds them at least marginally acceptable. Diana sponsors their debut, and all goes well; the cousins are accepted into the social whirl, and are soon managing the flower booth at the year's biggest charity ball.\nComplications arise with the appearance of Arthur Weldon, the on-again off-again suitor of Louise from previous books. Arthur has been keeping company with Diana Von Taer, but once he sees Louise again his passion for her re-awakens \u2013 which arouses Diana's jealousy. Diana solicits her cousin Charles Connoldy Mershone, a ne'er-do-well and social black sheep, to pay court to Louise as a way to disrupt her romance with Arthur.\nDiana doesn't anticipate that Mershone will actually fall in love with Louise \u2013 but he does. When Louise rejects him for the virtuous Arthur, Mershone goes to the extreme of abducting the young woman and keeping her at Diana's country house (in East Orange, New Jersey, then a rural backwater). Louise's absence impels her family and Arthur to call in the police and hire private detectives \u2013 one in particular, Quintus Fogerty, \"the best man in all New York.\" Mershone is the obvious suspect in Louise's disappearance, but he is too crafty to reveal the missing girl's location. The affair allows the novel to take a look at a harsher and uglier side of contemporaneous social world.\nLouise is initially shocked and disoriented by her abduction; but after five days she recovers enough to stage an escape. During an \"old fashioned snowstorm\" she climbs out a window and down a trellis. She is eventually overcome by the storm, but is rescued by a passing farm couple. Arthur Weldon discovers Louise at the farmer's house, where they are joyfully re-united.\nLouise's family decides not to prosecute the repentant Mershone, to avoid a newspaper scandal and to eschew the \"doubtful satisfaction\" of revenge. The story concludes with the very fashionable wedding of Arthur Weldon and Louise Merrick. In the end, even Beth has modified her attitudes toward the social world:\n\"Society,\" announced Beth, complacently, \"is an excellent thing in the abstract. It has its black sheep, of course; but I think no more than any other established class of humanity.\"\n\"Dear me!\" cried Uncle John; \"you once denounced society.\"\n\"That,\" said she, \"was before I knew anything at all about it.\"\nBaum introduces the character of the private detective Quintus Fogerty in this book; the character re-appears in a later volume of the series, Aunt Jane's Nieces on Vacation. Fogerty serves the \"purpose of extricating the girls when necessary\" from plot difficulties. Critic"

On the planet Cato Neimoidia, Jedi generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker lead clone troopers to capture Nute Gunray, Trade Federation viceroy and one of the leaders of the Separatists.  Gunray narrowly escapes to rendezvous with General Grievous and the rest of the Separatist Council, but he leaves behind his walking chair equipped with a specially-constructed holotransceiver. Republic analysts find the afterimage of Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who masterminded the Clone Wars.  However, this puts the Jedi no closer to finding Sidious himself.\nWhile Kenobi and Skywalker pursue the constructor of the chair, General Grievous is commanded by Sidious through his apprentice Count Dooku to relocate the Separatist Council to Belderone, where a Republic fleet lies in wait for them.  Furious, Grievous learns that Gunray lost the holotransceiver. Republic Intelligence find the signature of the artist that designed the mechno-chair that Sidious provided Gunray. Kenobi and Skywalker seek out the artist, a Xi Charrian, who tells them to find the designer, contracted by Sidious, to build the holotransceiver built into the mechno-chair. The Jedi find the designer in a prison, where he tells them that he built two holotransceivers, one for the mechno-chair, another for a ship of unknown design. The designer knows the identity of the pilot that delivered the ship to its owners (Darth Maul and Sidious). The pilot, a Lethan Twi'lek, is discovered on a moon by the Jedi, and she describes to the Jedi the location of the delivered ship: a columnar building in The Works, a desolate industrial park on Coruscant.\nOn Coruscant, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine resists the Jedi Council's suggestion to recall Jedi from the Outer Rim worlds due to the Separatist threat.  Palpatine's increased calls for public surveillance and restriction on freedom of movement and action prompt Senators Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Bail Organa, and Mon Mothma to persuade him to pull back from the brink. Palpatine somehow knows Sidious' name and orders the Jedi and Republic intelligence to hunt him down. In the bowels of the planet, trace elements lead Jedi Mace Windu, Shaak Ti and Republic intelligence to track down the same Darth Sidious that Count Dooku had been meeting with, the tower described by the Twi'lek pilot. The Jedi/Intelligence team are led through endless tunnels, but find a trail of evidence that leads to the Senate district. Here, the trail grows cold at the base of 500 Republica, the personal quarters of many of Coruscant's finest. At 500 Republica, a Republic Intelligence agent named Captain Dyne was separated from the Jedi, and was the first of the Republic to realize Darth Sidious' true identity \u2013 Supreme Chancellor Palpatine himself. He was astonished to learn that the Sith really do rule the galaxy. He died with the satisfaction of escaping the war.  Before the search for the Sith Lord can proceed further, General Grievous leads an invasion of Coruscant that results in the capture of Palpatine.\nAs Coruscant is invaded by Separatist forces, Kenobi and Skywalker, fresh from an encounter with Dooku on the former industrial world of Tythe, use orbital hyperspace rings to depart for Coruscant. The novel ends \"To Be Concluded\".\nThe Supreme Chancellor effectively orders the Jedi on a wild-goose chase. But since certain Jedi trace the trail of his real identity back to Coruscant (see Yoda's ability to sense him on Coruscant, as well as Windu's investigations) he orchestrates his own kidnapping to end the chase and to further Anakin's eventual turn to the dark side of the Force.\nAfter Kenobi, Anakin, and Palpatine crash land on Coruscant, Anakin and Kenobi have a brief conversation about who owes whom what. Obi-Wan mentions that \"that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count.\"\nThe novel reveals how all records of Kamino are erased from the Jedi Library in Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones.\nLabyrinth of Evil is the fourth Star Wars book written by James Luceno. It was released a few months before Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith, the final installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The novels served as a direct tie-in to the film, depicting events that occur directly before the events portrayed in Revenge of the Sith. Labyrinth of Evil is one of several novels that Luceno has written that connect directly with individual Star Wars films, such as Cloak of Deception (2001), which depicted events"

In his 2019 non-fiction book, which is based on several years of research undertaken in the 2010s in the South and Midwest states\u2014Missouri, Tennessee and Kansas, physician and psychiatrist Jonathan Metzl reveals the unintended public health consequences of some right-wing backlash politics related to taxes, gun control, social safety nets, and healthcare on vulnerable white voters they had promised to help. Through \"field interviews, research and public-health data\" gathered over the years of travel to these states, Metzl found that some vulnerable white Americans would literally rather die than betray their political views that have become enmeshed with their own sense of white identity.\nMetzl, who is a physician and psychiatrist who grew up in Missouri, and earned his medical degree in Kansas City, described how this book emerged from a research study he undertook from 2013 to 2018 in the South and Midwest states, including Missouri, Kansas, and Tennessee. Metzl began his research to enhance understanding of the health implications of \"backlash governance\". His methods which included field interviews with a wide range of everyday Americans, along with research and public-health data, revealed that racial resentment among lower- and middle-class white Americans, who believe politicians can make their lives great again, led to the enactment of public policy changes related to gun control, the Affordable Care Act, severe cuts to social services and education in states such as Missouri, Tennessee and Kansas, that placed these voters at a heightened risk of death by suicide, gun violence, a decrease in life expectancy and an increase in school dropout rates. He calls on white Americans to reject the racial hierarchies that are leading America's demise. \nJonathan Metzl, a Guggenheim fellow, a Nashville, Tennessee Vanderbilt University professor of sociology and psychiatry, who earned his PhD in American Culture from the University of Michigan, has also authored The Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease in 2014, Against Health: How Health Became the New Morality in 2010, and Prozac on the Couch: Prescribing Gender in the Era of Wonder Drugs in 2003.\nEsquire and The Boston Globe said it was one of the most anticipated books of 2019. The Globe said that this book goes deeper into examining how \"segments of the American electorate support candidates and political ideas that run contrary to their own self-interest\". Metzl, from the perspective of a \"sociologist and psychiatrist...examines the ways policies of right-wing backlash (pro-gun laws, cuts to education, social services, and health care) affect the lives and life expectancies of these people.\"\nThe Star Tribune wrote, \"As a physician and psychiatrist reared in the Midwest, Metzl has science and Heartland street cred on his side; as a public health instructor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, his clinical approach doesn't overshadow his skill as a wordsmith. As a result, Dying of Whiteness is a weighty but smooth read, devoid of polemics or jargon.\"\nAn April 27, 2019 book launch at the Politics and Prose bookstore in Northwest Washington, D.C., was briefly interrupted by a group of eight men and one woman, white nationalists, led by Patrick Casey, co-founder of  the American Identity Movement (AIM) with a megaphone and a videographer. They formed a line at the front of the seated audience and chanted \"AIM\", before they were herded from the store by the staff. The entire disruption lasted about a minute. The audience booed them and then continued the discussion about the book. Politics and Prose sold all their copies of Dying of Whiteness. According to The Washington Post, the bookstore owner had trained staff to prepare for white nationalist protests, because there had been protests against a number of books staged at bookstores including their own since early 2019, but they had not anticipated that this book would attract their attention.\nThe New York Times included the book on its list of antiracist books to read.\nAs a guest on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, Metzl said that the politics that claim to make America great again result in making working-class white lives harder, sicker, and shorter. Mertzl said that he devoted seven years traveling through the South tracking what happens when"

The story begins with Cameron \"Buck\" Williams, a renowned journalist having recently survived an attempted invasion of Israel, onboard a plane piloted by Rayford Steele en route to London. Suddenly, several passengers disappear without a trace. Upon being notified by flight attendant Hattie Durham, Steele contacts another pilot, only to then learn that disappearances have been reported around the world. \nSteele lands the plane in Chicago, which has descended into anarchy and chaos. He rushes home, only to find that his wife Irene and son Raymie have also vanished. He soon realizes that the Rapture, the taking of all Christians, has occurred. He later reunites with his distraught daughter Chloe.\nWilliams arrives in New York City where he meets with his father. However, he soon receives a call from his British contact Dirk, who informs him of a rising European politician. He later learns that the politician is Romanian President Nicolae Carpathia, who gives a rousing speech at the United Nations. \nSteele meets with Bruce Barnes, the pastor of the church he and Irene attended. Barnes reveals he was left behind for not truly believing in  God and Christ. He then explains that the Tribulation, a period of chaos and suffering, will soon begin. Chloe, after some debating, ultimately accepts the truth and becomes a Christian with her father.\nWilliams soon learns that Dirk has been found dead of a \"suicide\", and that an associate has also died. He manages to secure a meeting in London with Scotland Yard detective Alan Tompkins. Tompkins reveals evidence that Dirk was murdered, and that he has uncovered a conspiracy involving Joshua Todd-Cochran, the head of the London Stock Exchange, and American banker Jonthan Stonegal. Tompkins is abruptly murdered at the meeting, and Williams barely escapes. \nWilliams later learns that Scotland Yard has deemed him a suspect in Tompkins death. He arranges an interview with Carpathia, who uses his power and influence to remove Williams from suspicion. Carpathia reveals his intention to broker a seven year peace deal with Israel, and build the Third Temple in Jerusalem. \nWilliams meets up with Steele and Barnes, and informs the latter of Carpathia's plans. Barnes identifies them with those of the Antichrist, the prophesied end times tyrant, and urges Williams to accept Christ before it is too late. Williams is skeptical and leaves, but Barnes decides to form the \"Tribulation Force\", a Christian organization with the purpose of resisting the coming reign of the Antichrist. \nWilliams arrives at the United Nations to attend an assembly hosted by Carpathia. He soon learns, to his shock, that Stonegal and Cochran are there. He reluctantly becomes a Christian before entering. \nAt the meeting, Williams realizes that Carpathia is indeed the Antichrist. Carpathia suddenly executes Cochran and Stonegal, no longer needing them, and brainwashes everyone (except Williams, who is divinely protected) to think they died in a murder-suicide. \nHaving narrowly escaped the meeting, Williams meets up with the Tribulation Force and becomes a member to prepare for the Tribulation.\nRayford Steele - The protagonist. 747 captain for Pan-Continental in his mid-forties.

As part of his attempts to earn enough money to buy himself into the upper middle ranks, and thus make his relationship with Helena Justina respectable, Marcus Didius Falco has offered his services to Vespasian as a tax collector during the 'great Census' of AD 73. Unfortunately, his plan has several flaws, one major one being his need to take on Anacrites as a partner.\nWhilst conducting the audit of two gladitorial training schools, Falco stumbles upon the apparent murder of a star man-eating lion and an apparent rivalry between the schools. When a gladiator also ends up dead, Falco takes on the investigation, one which leads him to Tripolitania.\nTo add to the confusion, Helena's younger brother, Camillus Justinus, has eloped with the betrothed of his older brother, Aelianus. They too have made their way to North Africa, drawn by Justinus' quest to find Silphium, an expensive herb already deemed extinct.\nThe 'great Census' of AD 73,\nThe elopement of Camillus Justinus and Claudia Rufina,\nThe investigation into the rivalry between gladiatorial trainers,\nDeveloping relationship of Marcus Didius Falco and Helena Justina.\n\nAnacrites - Imperial spy and partner of Falco\nCamillus Aelianus - Eldest son of Decimus Camillus Verus\nCamillus Justinus - Youngest son of Decimus Camillus Verus\nClaudia Rufina - Heiress\nDecimus Camillus Verus - Senator and father of Helena Justina\nFamia - Maia's husband\nHelena Justina - Wife of Falco, and daughter of the Senator Decimus Camillus Verus\nJunilla Tacita - Mother of Falco\nLenia - Laundress\nMaia - Falco's sister\nMarcus Didius Falco - Informer and Imperial Agent.\nSmaractus - Husband of Lenia\nThalia - Circus manager\nAntonia Caenis - Mistress of Vespasian\nBuxus - Animal Keeper\nClaudius Laeta - Senior Palace Administrator\nPomponius Urtica - Praetor\nRumex - Gladiator\nRutilius Gallicus - Special envoy to Tripolitania\nScilla\nVespasian Augustus - Emperor of Rome\nArtemisia - Wife of Calliopus\nCalliopus - Venatio specialist from Oea\nEuphrasia - Wife of Saturninus\nFidelis - Interpreter\nHanno - From Sabratha\nIddibal - Bestiarus\nMyrrha - Punic\nSaturninus - Gladiator's trainer from Lepcis Magna\nWinner of the first Ellis Peters Historical Dagger awarded by the Crime Writers' Association in 1999.\n1998, UK, Century Hardback ISBN\u00a0978-0-7126-7796-7\n1999, UK, Arrow, Paperback ISBN\u00a0978-0-09-979961-0\n1999, UK, Isis, Audio, ISBN\u00a0978-0-7531-0509-2 (read by Christopher Scott)\n1999, US, Mysterious Press, Hardback ISBN\u00a0978-0-89296-693-6\n2000, US, Mysterious Press, Paperback ISBN\u00a0978-0-446-60902-9\n\nlindseydavis.co.uk Author's Official Website"

Three years after the events of Specials freed the world from the pretty lesions which forced them to be obedient, society is beginning to settle into a new form. Each city has been forced to find a way of dealing with the new pressure on its resources, caused by the freed creativity of the inhabitants. In Japan, one city has chosen a \"reputation economy\", rewarding citizens either with merits for productive tasks which help the city or with face rank, a measure of popularity. Every inhabitant has their own feed and obsessively tracks their face rank, hoping to gain fame and lose their status as an \"extra\". Aya Fuse tries to win fame as a \"kicker\", or journalist, filming stories with her modified hovercam Moggle and posting them for the whole city to see...\nAya Fuse is a 15-year-old girl living in the futuristic city of Yokohama. One night, accompanied by her hovercam Moggle, she crashes a party in New Pretty Town hoping to track down a group she saw surfing a mag-lev train, a story which she believes will make her famous. She follows one of the group's members, Eden Maru, out of the party, but they nearly get away when she is distracted by Frizz Mizuno, a more beautiful and far more famous person who compliments Aya. Aya leaves without telling Frizz her full name, because she is embarrassed by her comparatively low face rank. She then follows Eden into a cave, where she is ambushed by the mag-lev riders, who call themselves the Sly Girls. The group's leader Lai gives Aya a chance to join them, but to do so she is forced to drop Moggle into an underground lake.\nThe next day, she visits her famous brother Hiro in New Pretty Town, another kicker who is celebrating reaching the \"top thousand\" - a list of the thousand most famous people in the city. Hiro and his friend Ren Machino refuse to believe Aya's tale of the Sly Girls, who are an urban legend in the city, but Ren, who designed Moggle, agrees to help Aya retrieve him. Aya also happens upon a story about Frizz, discovering that he started a clique based around a brain surgery called Radical Honesty, which enforces honesty and makes a person unable to lie. That evening, Aya goes mag-lev surfing with the Sly Girls, enjoying the experience in spite of not having a camera to film it with. During the journey, the girls are surprised when the train stops, and they see inhuman figures loading the train up with a variety of items hidden within a secret underground room.\nAya retrieves Moggle, and uses him to film her next excursion with the Sly Girls, a mag-lev surfing trip which ends in exploration of the underground room they had discovered. Inside are many large cylinders of metal, and a large chute leading to the top of the mountain, neither of which are understood by the Sly Girls. They plan to return to explore further, but Aya's credibility is ruined by the kicking of a news story about Frizz Mizuno coming to talk to her by her dorm. Aya is forced to break off contact with Frizz in order to lose fame, which the Sly Girls despise, and the story leaves her disillusioned by the hateful comments of the kickers. However, she does have the chance to tell Hiro and Ren about the Sly Girls story, and from her description Ren guesses that the chute inside the mountain is a mass driver which, combined with the steel projectiles, could be used to launch an attack on the city.\nWhen Aya next meets the Sly Girls, they reveal that they knew she was a kicker, and have decided to allow her to kick the story of the mass driver in spite of their hatred of fame. They launch themselves and Aya out of the mass driver with homemade parachutes, giving her one last thrill before they part ways, and also giving themselves time to move on to a different city. Aya kicks her story and becomes instantly famous, but is concerned when she receives a message from Tally Youngblood telling her to \"run and hide\", and is nearly captured by the inhumans while trying to do so. Eventually, Aya uses her fame to take control of a high-security apartment, and waits there until Tally arrives, accompanied by Shay and Fausto.\nAfter talking, the Cutters (Tally, Shay, and Fausto) go hoverboarding with Aya, Hiro, Frizz and Ren. Aya has a signal up for her hovercam, and the Cutters boost it so the inhumans could find them. They are soon captured, and on the inhumans' ship headed for a camp outside of the rusty ruins of Singapore. Frizz ruins their plan due to his Radical Honesty, so the Cutters knock out the inhumans and put the hovercar on autopilot, where more inhumans wait.

The book opens up in 1829 with the desertion of the eight-year-old Dinah and her family by Dinah's father, John Kirkham.  After enduring many of the horrors of Industrial Revolution England, Dinah's family begins to prosper.  Dinah, her mother Anna, and her brother Charles, are converted to Mormonism.  But Dinah's elder brother, Robert, as well as her husband, Matthew, do not convert, leading to a permanent schism in the family.  The Mormon Kirkhams emigrate to Nauvoo, where the Mormons are building a city.\nIn Nauvoo, Dinah\u2014who had to endure an unthinkable sacrifice to come to America\u2014becomes the inspiration for the other women of Nauvoo.  She is regarded by many as a Prophetess, and, despite not having the priesthood, bestows blessings on others.  She also finds herself drawn to the prophet of the Latter Day Saint Church, Joseph Smith.  He teaches her that her husband in England had proven himself unworthy of her by his rejection of the Gospel and by forcing her to choose between God and husband.  Joseph introduces Dinah to the still-covert practice of plural marriage, and they are sealed for eternity as husband and wife.  Forced to keep secret her eternal union to Joseph causes strains on her relationships with the other women of the town, particularly Emma Smith, Joseph's first wife.\nAfter Joseph's death during his incarceration at Carthage, Dinah uses her influence to help Brigham Young emerge as the new Prophet of the Church, largely because he alone of the potential prophet candidates is determined to uphold the Principle (as plural marriage has come to be known among its adherents).  During the Mormon Exodus to Utah, she agrees to become one of Young's wives, with the understanding that their marriage will never be consummated.\nDinah lives to the age of 100, not only outliving all her husbands, but also outlasting the practice of plural marriage, which the Church abandoned in 1890.\nIn this novel Dinah Kirkham is supposed to have written a short story called \"The Best Day\".  In addition to appearing in this novel, it was also published in Card's short story collection Maps in a Mirror (1990).\nAs with many of Card's other literature, a Christian/Mormon influence is present in this book.  However, Card explicitly wrote it to appeal equally to Mormon and non-Mormon influences; the book does not seek to proselytize, though it does discuss Mormonism at length.\nOrson Scott Card is a descendant of Zina Diantha Huntington.  Like the character of Dinah, Zina Huntington was born in 1821, converted to Mormonism and became a plural wife of Joseph Smith (who dissolved her marriage to her first husband).  Also like Dinah, Zina Huntington next wed Brigham Young.  Unlike Dinah, Zina was American (though Young did marry at least one English bride, Eliza Burgess) and her marriage to Young was consummated; her daughter with Young, also named Zina, was Card's great-grandmother.\nList of works by Orson Scott Card\nLDS fiction\nAbout the novel Saints from Card's website"

The Red Tent is a historical novel by Anita Diamant, published in 1997 by Wyatt Books for St. Martin's Press. It is a first-person narrative that tells the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah, sister of Joseph. She is a minor character in the Bible, but the author has broadened her story. The book's title refers to the tent in which women of Jacob's tribe must, according to the ancient law, take refuge while menstruating or giving birth, and in which they find mutual support and encouragement from their mothers, sisters and aunts.\nThe book was a New York Times bestseller  and book club discussion guides for it have been published. According to the Los Angeles Times review, \"By giving a voice to Dinah, one of the silent female characters in Genesis, the novel has struck a chord with women who may have felt left out of biblical history.  It celebrates mothers and daughters and the mysteries of the life cycle.\"  The Christian Science Monitor wrote that the novel \"vividly conjures up the ancient world of caravans, shepherds, farmers, midwives, slaves, and artisans...Diamant is a compelling narrator of a tale that has timeless resonance.\"\nThe work promotes the biblical story. However, it is neither biblically nor historically correct. \nDiamant acknowledges that there is no evidence that ancient Israel used a menstrual tent for retreat, although she describes it as a common feature in other pre-modern cultures, as well as some modern cultures.\nCultural attitudes towards menstruation, including taboos, are widespread throughout history and around the world. These may include the seclusion of girls at puberty and of women after childbirth. Impurity after childbirth was a widespread belief, allied with the need for ritual purification.\nLifetime adapted the novel into a two-part miniseries, which premiered December 7 and 8, 2014. Dinah is portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson. Leah is portrayed by Minnie Driver, and Rachel by Morena Baccarin.\nCulture and menstruation\nMikvah, a bath of ritual purification\nNiddah\nAnita Diamant (1997). The Red Tent.

Slights is a first-person narrative by a troubled woman, Stevie, who lost her father when she was nine, and her mother when she was 18. Her father, a police officer, was killed during a mysterious shooting incident on the job, and her mother died when Stevie crashed their car while driving recklessly. The accident left Stevie badly injured and she had a near-death experience in which she found herself in a dark room filled with angry people threatening her. Usually nothing frightened Stevie, but that room terrified her, and she was relieved when she was revived in hospital.\nFrom an early age Stevie was anti-social and soon earned herself a bad reputation. After her mother's death she had the house to herself and began digging in the backyard, an activity her father had often indulged in. She stopped cleaning the house, and herself, and berated and abused most people she encountered. Her indifference to herself and others led to a suicide attempt when she was 21. She returned to that dark room filled with angry people clawing and tearing at her, and she was very grateful when someone found her unconscious and took her to hospital. While the room frightened her, she was intrigued by it and realised that the people in it were those she had slighted at some point in her life. She wanted to find out what other people's rooms were like and took a job at a local hospice to be close to people near death, but was frustrated when she could not get the information she wanted. Then she resorted to picking up strangers and bringing them home. She would get them drunk or drug them, and start killing them, but revive them as they lost consciousness so she could interrogate them. She never got much out of them and they all died. She buried the bodies in the backyard amongst her father's secrets. Stevie's backyard excavations had uncovered toys and trinkets from her childhood, but also objects she had never seen before, and bones.\nIndifferent to life and her fascination with death led to several more suicide attempts and trips to her dark room. Each time Stevie was discovered and revived. But when she was 35 she hung herself and no one found her in time to save her. She had learnt that her father had been under investigation for the deaths of several people, and with the reported disappearances of those she had murdered, it was only a matter of time before the police arrived at her house. For a very long time she lay in her dark room and endured the biting and scratching of those she had slighted. Then suddenly her tormentors were finished with her and left the room, and after a while Stevie heard her mother and father's voices and she began to rise along a \"golden path\".\nKaaron Warren is an Australian born author currently living in Fiji. She began her literary career writing short stories, and won several awards, including the Australian Ditmar and Aurealis Awards. Her short story collection, The Grinding House won the 2006 ACT Writing and Publishing Awards. Her first published story, \"White Bed\" was later dramatised for the stage, and the short film, Patience was based on her story, \"A Positive\".\nWarren began Slights as a short story, but as the main character Stevie developed, she found herself writing a \"far deeper story\" than she had intended, and it grew into her first novel. Stevie was originally male (Steve) but Warren made him female when she realised she could make the character more believable as a woman. Warren said that she wanted to convey the possibility that each person creates their \"own version of hell\". As a child she had seen pictures of different hells, depending on your sin, in a Hare Krishna text book, and these images had remained with her ever since. While working on Slights, she also wrote \"The Speaker of Heaven\", a short story about different versions of heaven.\nMartin Livings of the Australian Horror Writers Association wrote in his Long Fiction Report for the 2009 Australian Shadows Award that Slights is \"an extraordinary achievement\". He described the book as \"an intimate portrait of an awful person\", who after a broken childhood, never grows up and is unable to have meaningful relationships with others. Livings said it is \"a punch in the face, a kick in the testicles\" and will remain with you for a \"long, long time\".\nPublishers Weekly selected Slights as its \"Pick of the Week\" in August 2009, and said that Warren \"manipulates Stevie\u2019s voice to create a portrait of horror that in no way reads like a first novel\".

Mariamne has just recovered from a life-threatening illness. When she revives, she is gifted (or cursed) with unexpected voiced divination.

The Secret Magdalene, American writer Ki Longfellow's third book, was published in 2005. The historical novel challenges the traditional view of events chronicled in the New Testament, specifically the ministry of Jesus Christ and his relationship to Mary Magdalene. It is told entirely in the first-person voice of Mariamne.\nA hardback edition was published by Random House in 2006, followed by a trade paperback edition published by Three Rivers Press, a Random House imprint, in December 2007.\nIt has been translated into several languages, including Spanish, Czech, Chinese, French and Icelandic. It is a tale of Mariamne's quest to understand the gnosis she experienced as a child.\nLongfellow said she based the book on her studies of translations of historic Jewish and Arabic texts, as well as on modern Biblical scholarship. A selected bibliography is included.\nFeminism is a thread that runs through the book from first to last.\nThroughout The Secret Magdalene, Longfellow weaves historical facts and personages in her own interpretation of the Christ story. Longfellow said she based her choice of name for her lead character on the Nag Hammadi Papers, a collection of ancient Gnostic material found in 1945 in Egypt.  All editions of the book include a comprehensive though selected bibliography of materials used by Longfellow.\nThe novel has been praised by some theologians and historians but it was not reviewed in any major newspapers or journals. Seekers of Mary Magdalene have commented on its reflection of the daily life of the times, as well as the known historical personages it depicts. According to Bookreporter, \u201cThis is an imaginative novel that undoubtedly will attract a lot of attention and foster discussion about one of the most controversial and fascinating women in early Church history.\u201d\nIn June 2010, the book made Online Classes' list of \"100 All Time Best Historical Fiction Books\".\nThe central idea of the book is the realization of gnosis, a Greek word meaning divine knowledge.  In Asia, such an awakening is termed enlightenment.  At the age of nineteen, Longfellow had a sudden and spontaneous awakening to \"All That Is\". She wrote The Secret Magdalene to explore this experience through her novel.\nThe novel makes use of the New Testament context in order to explore a variety of philosophical, religious, and spiritual themes.  It questions the meaning and significance of the Jewish tradition, Hellenistic influences, early Gnosticism, and other ancient philosophical teachings, including the mystery religions that were widespread in the ancient world.\nWriter and film director Nancy Savoca, and her husband, film producer Rich Guay, bought the film rights of the Eio edition. Savoca is an independent filmmaker whose first film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The adaptation of The Secret Magdalene is, as of 2020, in active pre-production.\nhttp://www.eiobooks.com/newreleases.html Eio Books\n\"Celsus knows, moreover, certain sects...Carpocrations from Salome, and others who derive their name from Mariamne...\"\u2014Origen, Contra Celsus 5.62)\nMoondance, Summer 2005\nEarl Doherty, Review of Longfellow's The Secret Magdalene, Jesus Puzzle\nMagdalene.org Review: Ki Longfellow, The Secret Magdalene\n, The Bookreporter\n100 All Time Best Historical Fiction Books\", Online Classes, 1 June 2010\nDiscovery: an English Radio Two interview aired in 1990.\nThe Secret Magdalene, official website\n[secretmagdalene@cine.si.com The book of Savoca's next movie in pre-production]\nThe Secret Magdalene, Reading Group Guides\n\"Interview with Ki Longfellow\", Eio Books Broadcasting\n100 Best All Time Historical Fiction Books, Online Classes website, 1 June 2010\nNancy Savoca on IMDb"

The Red Tent is a historical novel by Anita Diamant, published in 1997 by Wyatt Books for St. Martin's Press. It is a first-person narrative that tells the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah, sister of Joseph. She is a minor character in the Bible, but the author has broadened her story. The book's title refers to the tent in which women of Jacob's tribe must, according to the ancient law, take refuge while menstruating or giving birth, and in which they find mutual support and encouragement from their mothers, sisters and aunts.\nThe book was a New York Times bestseller  and book club discussion guides for it have been published. According to the Los Angeles Times review, \"By giving a voice to Dinah, one of the silent female characters in Genesis, the novel has struck a chord with women who may have felt left out of biblical history.  It celebrates mothers and daughters and the mysteries of the life cycle.\"  The Christian Science Monitor wrote that the novel \"vividly conjures up the ancient world of caravans, shepherds, farmers, midwives, slaves, and artisans...Diamant is a compelling narrator of a tale that has timeless resonance.\"\nThe work promotes the biblical story. However, it is neither biblically nor historically correct. \nDiamant acknowledges that there is no evidence that ancient Israel used a menstrual tent for retreat, although she describes it as a common feature in other pre-modern cultures, as well as some modern cultures.\nCultural attitudes towards menstruation, including taboos, are widespread throughout history and around the world. These may include the seclusion of girls at puberty and of women after childbirth. Impurity after childbirth was a widespread belief, allied with the need for ritual purification.\nLifetime adapted the novel into a two-part miniseries, which premiered December 7 and 8, 2014.

The Secret Magdalene, American writer Ki Longfellow's third book, was published in 2005. The historical novel challenges the traditional view of events chronicled in the New Testament, specifically the ministry of Jesus Christ and his relationship to Mary Magdalene. It is told entirely in the first-person voice of Mariamne.\nA hardback edition was published by Random House in 2006, followed by a trade paperback edition published by Three Rivers Press, a Random House imprint, in December 2007.\nIt has been translated into several languages, including Spanish, Czech, Chinese, French and Icelandic. It is a tale of Mariamne's quest to understand the gnosis she experienced as a child.\nLongfellow said she based the book on her studies of translations of historic Jewish and Arabic texts, as well as on modern Biblical scholarship. A selected bibliography is included.\nFeminism is a thread that runs through the book from first to last.\nThroughout The Secret Magdalene, Longfellow weaves historical facts and personages in her own interpretation of the Christ story. Longfellow said she based her choice of name for her lead character on the Nag Hammadi Papers, a collection of ancient Gnostic material found in 1945 in Egypt.  All editions of the book include a comprehensive though selected bibliography of materials used by Longfellow.\nThe novel has been praised by some theologians and historians but it was not reviewed in any major newspapers or journals. Seekers of Mary Magdalene have commented on its reflection of the daily life of the times, as well as the known historical personages it depicts. According to Bookreporter, \u201cThis is an imaginative novel that undoubtedly will attract a lot of attention and foster discussion about one of the most controversial and fascinating women in early Church history.\u201d\nIn June 2010, the book made Online Classes' list of \"100 All Time Best Historical Fiction Books\".\nThe central idea of the book is the realization of gnosis, a Greek word meaning divine knowledge.  In Asia, such an awakening is termed enlightenment.  At the age of nineteen, Longfellow had a sudden and spontaneous awakening to \"All That Is\". She wrote The Secret Magdalene to explore this experience through her novel.\nThe novel makes use of the New Testament context in order to explore a variety of philosophical, religious, and spiritual themes.  It questions the meaning and significance of the Jewish tradition, Hellenistic influences, early Gnosticism, and other ancient philosophical teachings, including the mystery religions that were widespread in the ancient world.\nWriter and film director Nancy Savoca, and her husband, film producer Rich Guay, bought the film rights of the Eio edition. Savoca is an independent filmmaker whose first film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The adaptation of The Secret Magdalene is, as of 2020, in active pre-production.\nhttp://www.eiobooks.com/newreleases.html Eio Books\n\"Celsus knows, moreover, certain sects...Carpocrations from Salome, and others who derive their name from Mariamne...\"\u2014Origen, Contra Celsus 5.62)\nMoondance, Summer 2005\nEarl Doherty, Review of Longfellow's The Secret Magdalene, Jesus Puzzle\nMagdalene.org Review: Ki Longfellow, The Secret Magdalene\n, The Bookreporter\n100 All Time Best Historical Fiction Books\", Online Classes, 1 June 2010\nDiscovery: an English Radio Two interview aired in 1990.\nThe Secret Magdalene, official website\n[secretmagdalene@cine.si.com The book of Savoca's next movie in pre-production]\nThe Secret Magdalene, Reading Group Guides\n\"Interview with Ki Longfellow\", Eio Books Broadcasting\n100 Best All Time Historical Fiction Books, Online Classes website, 1 June 2010\nNancy Savoca on IMDb"

It is the third book in The Stone Dance of the Chameleon trilogy, which concerns the harrowing experiences of the young and inexperienced heir to a ruling dynasty who is suddenly taken from his protected childhood and thrust into a cruel society where he must fight for his family honour, his position and his life. The Third God continues the story of Chameleon and the would-be God Emperor Osidian, who has raised a barbarian army and now seeks revenge on those who stripped him of his rightful inheritance and left him for dead. ...",

Some series become formulaic with the same characters going over the same ground on the way to a final victory, but not this one. It is definitely one story in three parts. The first in the series is perhaps the most nearly a traditional fantasy epic, with the unsuspecting hero growing into his role as a master of the Guarded Land and taking part in the election of the new god-emperor...before everything comes apart. The second recounts time in exile in the Earthsky where our heroes forge an army out of the barbarian tribes. This book recounts their return to the Guarded Land and final battle to recover their birthright. The book could just about be read as a complete story, but much relies upon a knowledge of the previous books to be fully appreciated.\nYet this is not a conventional fantasy. It is set in a wholly barbaric land, where the ruling Masters are truly masters of their art of inflicting suffering. The whole story is told from the perspective of Carnelian, who in the first book has to come to terms with violence, maiming and death being visited on his family and those he has grown up with, having been raised by his father in exile and thus been sheltered from the casual violence of the society he has inherited to rule. In the second, he experiences the lot of a slave, being cast out together with Osidian (who was brought up at court so is thoroughly versed in the best of Masterly sadistic intrigue) before building a following amongst the plains people, leaving a steadily growing wake of death as they go. In the third the massed armies of the guarded land, together with all the weapons of destruction the Masters could devise are brought together with predictable results of death on an even greater scale than before.\nAll this death and violence will be off-putting for some readers, yet it is used through Carnelian's reaction against it as a cry against the horrors of war. The rising tide of destruction is an object lesson in unforeseen consequences and the risks of carelessly destroying all you hold dear through the singleminded pursuit of some goal.\nCarnelian is not an uncertain hero but has to make hard choices as he tries to support yet also restrain Osidian's determination to return to power at the heart of the empire. The plot is a good fantasy epic with plenty of twists and turns, and despite all the devastation manages to maintain a thread of hope for the final resolution to the conflict. Yet it also keeps you guessing, for with so many losses along the way it is never certain which apparently central character will be next to depart for another life.\nThere is a love story woven through it, which once again is an assertion of the triumph of fundamental humanity against impossible obstacles.\"\n\"a biography\".

Surely he has no choice but to pay...\nUsed in Evidence\nA man's fight against eviction from the condemned house where he has lived alone since his wife disappeared 15 years before, becomes more understandable when the mummified cadaver of a woman is found bricked up between the wall and chimney breast of his fireplace. In such an open-and-shut case, why will he not even say a word?\nPrivilege\nWhen a businessman finds himself libeled by a careless journalist, it seems there is little he can do about it that will not bankrupt him. If only the law in such matters had any part that was equitable to all.\nDuty\nA couple vacationing in France in the 1950s finds a ghost of Irish history.\nA Careful Man\nMr. Timothy Hanson is a self-made man with a terminal cancer. If he hates his sister, his only surviving relative, as much as he hates the death tax, why does his last will specify that the woman and her husband get his entire estate, if only both of them will personally push the lead coffin containing Hanson's body, off a boat into the deep waters of the English Channel?\nSharp Practice\nIn the unsophisticated world of 1938, a deck of marked cards used in a game of poker on a train might be just what it seems, or not.\nForsyth has written another collection of short stories, The Veteran.\nNo Comebacks Bantam Books edition, 1988.

Following the events of Persepolis Rising, James Holden is a captive on Laconia, allowed to roam the grounds of High Consul Winston Duarte\u2019s palace but with little other freedom. He pays his respects to Chrisjen Avasarala, who died four months previously, and talks with her granddaughter and Camina Drummer, former president of the now-defunct Transport Union.\nThrough another of the Ring gates, Elvi Okoye, her husband Fayez, and several other scientists are sent on a Laconian mission to the \u201cdead worlds\u201d, systems past the ring gates which have no habitable worlds. They find a green diamond which interacts strangely with their sample of active protomolecule, but are forced by the commander to move on to the next system before they can adequately probe it. They arrive to find a single neutron star pushed to the edge of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov limit, with no other matter in the area. The Laconian commander reveals their plan to send an antimatter-laden ship through the ring gates in order to attack the creatures which have been seen \u201ceating\u201d ships. In the Sol system, Naomi, working for the underground resistance against Laconia, arrives on a station in the Outer Planets to talk with Bobbie and Alex, operating their stolen Laconian gunship The Gathering Storm, before leaving again. Bobbie and Alex embark on a mission to capture a Laconian freighter carrying resupplies and a high-ranking political officer, but both the officer and their own spies are caught in the crossfire and killed. Faced with overwhelming odds, one of the Laconian flagships taking notice of them, and notching another (semi-)failure, both are left to wonder whether their fight is winnable at all. Then Bobbie finds antimatter in the supplies taken from the Laconian freighter, a power source for its magnetic weapon, and hatches a plan to kill the flagship.\nOn Laconia, Teresa Duarte, the fourteen-year-old daughter of Winston, learns that her father wants to train her to be the next high consul despite his quest of immortality, and talks with Holden about his status in Duarte\u2019s court. She also sneaks away to talk with a man she met in a mountain cave, who she calls \u201cTimmy\u201d. Naomi mingles with the crew of the ship she rides on to avoid discovery by a Laconian political officer, and is saved by the chief engineer who knows her from the events of Babylon\u2019s Ashes\u2014until their travel is cut short by a warning from the ring gates. The Laconian experiment, witnessed by Fayez and Elvi (who tried to stop it, to little avail) causes the neutron star to collapse into a black hole and emit a gamma-ray burst, lighting up the slow zone and destroying two of the ring gates. Duarte tells Teresa that they plan to send another antimatter ship, but before the attack can be carried out, the aliens make their own attack: everyone experiences \u2018lost time\u2019 where they can see the spaces between things and atoms; Elvi and Fayez are wounded and several of their colleagues killed when parts of their ship vanish; Medina Station, the second Laconian flagship, and everything inside is annihilated in an instant; and Duarte himself, augmented by the protomolecule, becomes catatonic.\nBobbie and Alex make the decision to ask Naomi about their plan to attack the Laconian flagship, the Tempest. Holden recognizes that something is wrong on Laconia, and speaks with Paolo Cort\u00e1zar, the head scientist, who plans to kill Teresa rather than letting her become immortal.\nWith the death of Medina Station, Naomi travels to Auberon\u2014one of the most prosperous ring worlds\u2014and takes over the underground. Elvi lands on Laconia and is told of what happened to Duarte and that her assistance is needed in running the scientific endeavors there; at the same time, Holden attempts to tell them of Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s plot against Teresa. Teresa herself is worried over the state of her father, and goes to visit \u201cTimmy\u201d, who is revealed to be Amos Burton, sent with a pocket nuclear weapon to try and rescue Holden. The Laconian security force finds the two of them and kill Amos, though when they return they cannot find his body. Elvi speaks at the science center with two children who died, but were reconstructed by the repair drones native to Laconia.\nBobbie and Alex embark to kill the Laconian flagship, using a bomb constructed from antimatter and a gap in its sensors caused by the Sol forces. Alex distracts the flagship with the Gathering Storm while Bobbie delivers the bomb, but their ship is damaged and she is forced to throw the bomb at the Tempest directly. It destroys the"

Eighteen months after the events of Leviathan Wakes, the solar system is in a precarious balance while they watch unknowable events unfold on the planet Venus. Earth and Mars are still poised for battle, and someone didn't recognize the warning that the Eros Incident held for humanity.\nOn Ganymede, Mei Meng is kidnapped from her preschool by her doctor. Several hours later, Earth and Martian space marines are attacked and effortlessly killed by a super soldier, with Bobbie Draper, a Martian marine, the only survivor. Earth and Mars begin a shooting war which throws Ganymede into chaos. In the aftermath, Mei's father Praxidike Meng fruitlessly searches for his daughter in the midst of the societal breakdown in the Ganymede colony. Several months later, the crew of the Rocinante are tasked with delivering emergency aid to Ganymede. Meng spots James Holden during a food riot and asks the crew to help find his daughter. They agree and are able to trace her kidnappers to unused tunnels on the moon. Holden, Meng, and ship mechanic Amos Burton discover a secret lab. In the midst of a shootout with lab security, they inadvertently release another super soldier who kills some of the lab personnel. In the wake of the battle, the crew find remnants of the protomolecule and the corpse of Mei's friend, who was being treated by Mei's doctor for immunodeficiency. The crew rush to escape the station as more chaos erupts around them, and are able to make it back aboard the Rocinante.\nDraper is brought to the peace talks between Earth and Mars occurring on Earth, giving testimony regarding the super soldier attack on Ganymede. She violates diplomatic protocol and is dismissed by the Martian delegation, but is then hired by Chrisjen Avasarala, who is leading the UN negotiations. Draper discovers that Avasarala's assistant is betraying her, leading Avasarala to conclude that her UN superiors are trying to get rid of her, from which she deduces that a group within the UN is responsible for the super soldier attack. Avasarala allows Draper to be brought along as her bodyguard on a slow-moving yacht headed to Ganymede on an ostensible relief mission. On their way to Tycho station, the Rocinante crew discovers a super soldier stowed away in their cargo hold. They are able to lure out the creature using radioactive bait before vaporizing it with the ship's exhaust. The Rocinante is damaged during the encounter, but the crew learn more about the super soldiers. Holden confronts Fred Johnson, who he believes controls the only other sample of the protomolecule. Johnson denies involvement with the Ganymede incident and fires Holden's crew. They help Meng release a video asking for help searching for Mei, raising enough money to continue the search. Upon receiving information about Mei's doctor, Meng deduces that the super soldiers are being created on a base on Io. With the Rocinante repaired, they set out to recover Mei.\nOn board the yacht, Avasarala sees Meng's video appeal and learns that a UN detachment is heading to intercept the Rocinante. The crew of the yacht prevent her from warning Holden, claiming that their communication systems are broken. When they refuse her demands to get the yacht repaired, Avasarala has Draper take control of the vessel. Avasarala sends a warning to Holden, and she and Draper board a racing pinnace to rendezvous with the Rocinante. After meeting Holden's crew, Avasarala and Draper share notes of the super soldiers. Realizing that they are several days away from being destroyed by the UN detachment, Avasarala convinces the crew to let her send this information to her contacts within the UN to prevent an all-out war. Draper and Avasarala convince the Martian fleet to help protect the Rocinante. This culminates in a space battle between the UN detachment, the Martian forces, and a second UN fleet loyal to Avasarala. With the UN Secretary General recalling the admiral hostile to the Rocinante, the battle ends in victory for the Martians and Avasarala's faction. The crew lands on Io, where Amos and Meng rescue Mei along with other immunodeficient children. Draper kills a super soldier using knowledge about its capabilities. The crew heads back to Luna, where the people responsible for the super soldier project are brought to justice. Avasarala is promoted, Meng is hired to oversee efforts to restore Ganymede, Draper returns to Mars, and the Rocinante takes a contract escorting a supply ship.

Pimatisewin is regarded as a relative by both Bernice and Maggie, and is used by Lindberg to portray non-human bonds of kinship and the obligations implicit in those bonds. Lindberg, in the author interview, explains that Pimatisewin is a Cree word that roughly translates to \"the good life\" in English. Eenou Pimaatisiiwin, as it is sometimes spelled, is an essential aspect of Cree traditional knowledge and represents an element of Cree survival.\nAcimowin means story in Cree. Throughout the novel, usually at the end of chapters, these stories, or acimowin, get told as an oral history of the lessons Bernice learns throughout her journey. Acimowin represent the way in which Cree people pass down certain life lessons.\nA central tenet of Cree law, called Wahkohtowin, is used in the novel Birdie. The principle of Wahkohtowin is that people treat one another with respect and care. Through the use of story, Lindberg explores situations in which these laws are broken. Lindberg has said that the obligations of this law have been broken by people in Bernice\u2019s life, and her childhood home lacked reciprocal obligations.\n\nAuntie Val, when she tells a bit of her story, relates that her grandmother's people had not signed their rights away to the Treaty Commissioner. Val goes as far as to say that \"her people. . .have not been colonized or 'Indian Acted' to death, but because they did not sign any treaties their family was not legally allowed to live on the reserve in Loon Lake. Lindberg expands on this point in the author interview when she states that Bernice's family had a home on the reserve but they could not inhabit that house because they were not status Indians. The Indian Act was one of the ways in which the Canadian government tried to control Indigenous identity while simultaneously dispossessing Indigenous peoples of their lands.\nBirdie deals with the ongoing Canadian political issue of Missing and murdered Indigenous women. 84%of Indigenous women experience violence, with 10% of all missing person cases in Canada being Indigenous women and girls.  In the context of Birdie, Maggie represents this fraught history between Canada and Indigenous women. Maggie disappears at the end of the novel, Lindberg writing \"she chose this city and this neighbourhood because she knows someone like her can disappear here\" which speaks to the significance of the problem. Lindberg's choice to include a commentary on MMIW stems from her advocacy work in the area.\nM\u00e9tis scholar and professor Aubrey Hanson wrote about Birdie in her article, \"Reading for Reconciliation? Indigenous Literatures in a Post-TRC Canada.\" Hanson argues that Birdie demonstrates the possibilities of non-Indigenous people reading Indigenous texts for the resurgence of Indigenous communities.\nAt CBC Canada Reads in 2016, 10,000 copies of Birdie were donated to Canadian schools by Bruce Poon Tip, the defender of Lindberg\u2019s novel.

Val goes as far as to say that \"her people. . .have not been colonized or 'Indian Acted' to death, but because they did not sign any treaties their family was not legally allowed to live on the reserve in Loon Lake. Lindberg expands on this point in the author interview when she states that Bernice's family had a home on the reserve but they could not inhabit that house because they were not status Indians. The Indian Act was one of the ways in which the Canadian government tried to control Indigenous identity while simultaneously dispossessing Indigenous peoples of their lands.\nBirdie deals with the ongoing Canadian political issue of Missing and murdered Indigenous women. 84%of Indigenous women experience violence, with 10% of all missing person cases in Canada being Indigenous women and girls.  In the context of Birdie, Maggie represents this fraught history between Canada and Indigenous women. Maggie disappears at the end of the novel, Lindberg writing \"she chose this city and this neighbourhood because she knows someone like her can disappear here\" which speaks to the significance of the problem. Lindberg's choice to include a commentary on MMIW stems from her advocacy work in the area.\nM\u00e9tis scholar and professor Aubrey Hanson wrote about Birdie in her article, \"Reading for Reconciliation? Indigenous Literatures in a Post-TRC Canada.\" Hanson argues that Birdie demonstrates the possibilities of non-Indigenous people reading Indigenous texts for the resurgence of Indigenous communities.\nAt CBC Canada Reads in 2016, 10,000 copies of Birdie were donated to Canadian schools by Bruce Poon Tip, the"

Miramar is a novel authored by Naguib Mahfouz, an Egyptian Nobel Prize-winning author. It was written in 1967 and translated into English in 1978.\nAs with many Naguib Mahfouz novels, Miramar is rife with symbolism. The character Zohra has been proposed to symbolize the ideal modern Egyptian/Egypt. She is hard working and honest but uneducated, and constantly being pulled by different forces.\nAmong those pulling her and Egypt are Europeans, Egyptian nationalists (Wafd party), the wealthy upper-class, the Abdel Nasser regime and its followers, and the Muslim Brotherhood."

Burmese Days is the first novel by English writer George Orwell, published in 1934. Set in British Burma during the waning days of empire, when Burma was ruled from Delhi as part of British India, the novel serves as \"a portrait of the dark side of the British Raj.\" At the centre of the novel is John Flory, \"the lone and lacking individual trapped within a bigger system that is undermining the better side of human nature.\" The novel describes \"both indigenous corruption and imperial bigotry\" in a society where, \"after all, natives were natives\u2014interesting, no doubt, but finally...an inferior people\".\nBurmese Days was first published \"further afield,\" in the United States, because of concerns that it might be potentially libelous; that the real provincial town of Katha had been described too realistically; and that some of its fictional characters were based too closely on identifiable people. A British edition, with altered names, appeared a year later. Nonetheless, Orwell's harsh portrayal of colonial society was felt by \"some old Burma hands\" to have \"rather let the side down\". In a letter from 1946, Orwell wrote, \"I dare say it's unfair in some ways and inaccurate in some details, but much of it is simply reporting what I have seen\".\nOrwell spent five years from 1922 to 1927 as a police officer in the Indian Imperial Police force in Burma (now Myanmar). The British had gradually annexed Burma in stages, and it was not until 1885, when they captured the royal capital of Mandalay, that Burma as a whole could be declared part of the British Empire. Migrant workers from India and China supplemented the native Burmese population. Although Burma was the wealthiest country in Southeast Asia under British rule, as a colony it was seen very much as a backwater. The image which Britons were meant to uphold in these communities was a huge burden and the majority of them carried expectations all the way from Britain with the intention of maintaining their customs and rule. Among its exports, the country produced 75 per cent of the world's teak from up-country forests. When Orwell came to the Irrawaddy Delta in January 1924 to begin his career as an imperial policeman, the delta was Burma's leading exporting region, providing three million tons of rice annually, half the world's supply. Orwell served in a number of locations in Burma. After a year of training in Mandalay and Maymyo, his postings included Myaungmya, Twante, Syriam, Moulmein, and Kathar. It also included Insein, situated north of Rangoon, the site of the colony's most secure prison, and now Burma's most notorious jail.\nBurmese Days was several years in the writing. Orwell drafted it in Paris from 1928 to 1929. He revised it in 1932 at Southwold while doing up the family home during the summer holidays. By December 1933 he had typed the final version, and in 1934 delivered it to his agent, Leonard Moore, who submitted it to Victor Gollancz, the publisher of Orwell's previous book. Gollancz, already fearing prosecution from having published another author's work, turned it down because he was worried about charges of libel. Heinemann and Cape turned it down for the same reason. After demanding alterations, Harpers was prepared to publish it in the United States, where it appeared in 1934. In the spring of 1935, Gollancz declared that he was prepared to publish a British edition provided Orwell could demonstrate he had not named real people. To that end, extensive checks were made in colonial lists before Gollancz brought out the English version on 24 June 1935. Nonetheless, many of the main European names appearing in the novel have since been identified in the Rangoon Gazette as belonging to real people, with the name \"U Po Kyin\" in particular belonging to a Burmese officer who was at the Police Training School in Mandalay with Orwell.\nJohn (in some editions, James) Flory: referred to as just \"Flory\" throughout the novel. He is the central character, a timber merchant in his mid-thirties. He has a long, dark blue birthmark that stretches from his eye to the side of his mouth on his left cheek, and he tries to avoid showing people the left side of his face as he thinks the birthmark is hideous. Whenever he is ashamed or looks down upon himself he remembers his birthmark, a symbol of his weakness. He is very friendly with the Indian Dr Veraswami, and appreciates Burmese culture. This brings him into conflict with members of the club, who dislike his slightly radical views. Because of his rather shy personality and the fact that he dislikes quarrels, he is an easy target in arguments,"

Wells had not planned to write a sequel novel, but after the success of I Am Not a Serial Killer, his publisher requested that the book be expanded into a trilogy. Like the first book, Mr. Monster required research into offender profiling and embalming.\nWells has described Mr. Monster as \"about half as gory as the first book, but at least twice as creepy\". He focused on balancing John Cleaver's sympathetic and frightening sides. He has also commented that writing the sequels to Serial Killer \"really helped me grow as a writer, by forcing me to dig deeper into the character and find new ways to challenge him and myself.\" This protagonist calls the darker part of his personality \"Mr. Monster\", which was one of the aliases employed by serial killer David Berkowitz, also known as the \"Son of Sam.\"\nIn the aftermath of the Clayton Killer, John Wayne Cleaver is struggling to balance his desire to do and be good with his darker side, which he calls \"Mr. Monster\" and which he previously let loose in order to save the town. His mom is now aware of his rules and helps to enforce them, but refuses to confront the reality that the Clayton Killer, posing as Mr. Crowley, was actually a demon. John frequently meets with an FBI investigator, Agent Forman, but is careful not to reveal any information about the strange, supernatural activity he witnessed \u2013 or the fact that he himself killed Crowley. When Agent Forman informs John of a new murder victim, he begins to suspect that a new serial killer \u2013 possibly a demon \u2013 is on the loose. John then meets his sister Lauren's new boyfriend, Curt, whose behavior earns him the top spot on John's list of suspects. Meanwhile, he grows closer to Brooke and decides to ask her out on a date \u2013 despite his recurring nightmares about harming her. When they attend the school bonfire, another body is found in the lake. As John examines the evidence, he realizes the new killer is imitating Crowley; this time, however, the victims were tortured prior to their death.\nWhile John assists his mother in embalming the body at the family mortuary, Lauren walks in and reveals that Curt has hit her. This triggers Mr. Monster's emergence; in order to curb his urge to kill Curt, John burns down an old warehouse and kills a cat. He begins to wonder if it is even possible to corral Mr. Monster at all. He ignores his issues for a moment and takes Brooke on a second date. While they are out, a news report reveals that a third body has been found. John rushes to Agent Forman's office, only to discover that he knows about Crowley's being a demon. Moreover, Forman himself is a demon, part of a network that has been searching for Mkhai \u2013 the being that took over Crowley's body \u2013 for the past 40 years. He keeps the women he's kidnapped \u2013 his \"toys\" \u2013 at a house outside Clayton. Forman takes John there, and tempts him with the opportunity to harm and kill the women, but John resists. Instead, he discovers that Forman is a different type of demon; his special power is being able to feel exactly what the people around him are feeling. Once John tells the trapped women of his discovery, they use it against him; one of the women sacrifices herself so that Forman will become weak enough for John to kill. However, Forman recovers, leaves the house, and brings back Curt as an offering to John. John resists the temptation a second time, instead distracting Forman with the story of how Mkhai fell in love with Kay Crowley. This gives Forman an idea, and he returns to the house with Brooke. In his absence, John constructed a trap for Forman by running an electrical current to his torture devices and hiding the wires. John has to pretend that he is going to harm Brooke in order to get Forman to fall for the trap; it works, and Forman's body melts. John saves most of the women, but Curt lights the house on fire before he can save one who had been trapped in the wall.\nJohn wakes up in the hospital, and the police inform him that the testimonies of the women of his heroics have cleared him of any charges. Later, Brooke comes by to break up with John, saying she doesn't want to confront the truth about what happened back at the house, and hands him Forman's phone. He finds the phone numbers of other demons, and calls one named \"Nobody,\" telling her to come find him. Slaying demons offers him an outlet for Mr. Monster.\nCritical reception of Mr. Monster was mostly positive, with multiple reviewers highlighting Wells's further development"

Gregor and the Code of Claw is a children's novel by author Suzanne Collins, best known for her Hunger Games trilogy. It is the fifth and final book of The Underland Chronicles, and was published in 2007. Scholastic has rated the book's \"grade level equivalent\" as 4.5 and the book's lexile score as 730L, making it reading-level-appropriate for the average fourth to sixth grader. The novel has been praised especially as a conclusion to The Underland Chronicles. In its description of the novel, as part of its \"Recommended Books\" award, the CCBC states, \"Although Gregor and the Code of Claw works as a stand-alone story, readers will want to start with book one and work their way through to this final volume.\" An audiobook version was released in 2008, read by Paul Boehmer.\n\nGregor: The series' protagonist, the Overland \"warrior\" of Bartholomew of Sandwich's prophecies, and a rager (a warrior with berserker-like fighting ability). Despite his tremendous skills as a fighter, Gregor cares deeply for those around him and tries very hard to retain his humanity during the Underland war. He develops romantic feelings for the Underlander Luxa.\nAres: A large, very strong black bat and Gregor's bond. Before the war, he was shunned by bats and humans alike for allowing his bond Henry to die. During the war, however, the public's opinion of him begins to change because of his skills as a warrior. Ares is heralded as a hero upon his death in the region known as Tartarus.\nRipred: A rat, rager, and seasoned warrior. Ripred's immense experience and wisdom lead to his acting as general, strategist, and skilled fighter for the humans. Ripred never loses sight of his own goals, however, which almost restarts the human-gnawer conflict after the end of their war. Ripred becomes fond of Gregor's sister Lizzie, who reminds him of one of his deceased pups, and bonds with Queen Luxa in part because of his concern for her and her family.\nLuxa: The Underlanders' young queen, granddaughter of Solovet and Vikus. Luxa is proud, stubborn, and cares deeply for her friends. Though her friend Gregor admires these traits in general, they are not an asset for her during wartime, and this causes some conflict for her in Gregor and the Code of Claw. Luxa has been bonded to the flier Aurora since childhood, and bonds to the rat Ripred at the end of the novel. She also begins to develop romantic feelings for Gregor.\nLizzie: Gregor's little sister and \"princess\" of the prophecy (by her relation to Boots). Lizzie is very bright, but suffers from frequent panic attacks. As such, her older brother worries for her safety and almost refuses to allow her to stay in the Underland. The rat Ripred is mainly responsible for Gregor's change of heart, and promises to protect Lizzie with his life. Lizzie believes Ripred to be lonely, and is heartbroken when she thinks Ripred has died fulfilling his promise. The successful cracking of The Code of Claw is due in large part to her efforts.\nBoots (Margaret): Gregor and Lizzie's toddler sister. She is known by the crawlers as \"the princess\", which leads the Underland humans to believe she is important to the code-breaking effort. Her greatest importance to the story, however, comes from the contrast she presents between herself and her older brother. Gregor struggles to keep her in the dark about the terrible things going on around her, but is not entirely successful.\nSolovet: The Regalian army's head and wife of statesman Vikus. Gregor distrusts Solovet because of her involvement with the plague, but is forced to obey her orders because of her capability as a military commander. Gregor freely admits that the training she forces on him may have kept him alive, but still hates her for imprisoning him in the Regalian dungeon. Solovet is ambushed while on a diplomatic mission towards the end of the war and dies. Her husband, knowing that he could have saved her at the cost of revealing that the humans solved the Code of Claw, experiences a stroke as a result, and almost dies himself.\nThe Bane (Pearlpelt): A highly unstable, gigantic white rat believed to be a harbinger of doom in the Underland. The Bane is emotionally fragile but extremely dangerous, especially when goaded on by his \"friend\" Twirltongue. He personally kills numerous Underland creatures, including the flier Ares. He is killed by Gregor and Ares in the last few chapters of the novel.\nGregor and the Code of Claw has been reviewed favorably by critics, yet its print version never reached the top of bestseller lists except as"

Witch Week is a children's fantasy novel and school story by the British writer Diana Wynne Jones, published by Macmillan Children's Books in 1982. It was the third published of seven Chrestomanci books.\nWitch Week is set during the last four days of October 1981 at Larwood House, a boarding school in southern England, in a world parallel and close to ours. Many people have magical powers (\"witches\", male or female) but their use is a capital crime and convicted witches are burnt to death. The story begins with a teacher's discovery of an ambiguous note and dilemma whether to take it as a joke. \"The note said: SOMEONE IN THIS CLASS IS A WITCH.\"\nThe Chrestomanci books are collectively named after a powerful enchanter and British government official in a world parallel to ours, who supervises the use of magic \u2014or the Chrestomanci, a British government office that requires a powerful enchanter and is responsible for supervising. Witch Week is set in the late 20th century during the tenure of Christopher Chant, who is the Chrestomanci in five of the seven books and is often called Chrestomanci as a personal name.\nThe Chrestomanci is unique to what it calls \"World 12A\", the primary setting for the series and entire setting for some stories. There are other worlds with British governments, perhaps all of series 12 or even more. Our world is 12B, a next-door neighbour in some sense, and Witch Week is set entirely in one that is even closer to ours. The Chrestomanci has representatives in some worlds but does not know this one.\nOne of the major themes in the story is overcoming prejudice. Like many other books by Jones, Witch Week encourages readers to think for themselves and seek to make a positive change in the world.\nLarwood House may be a reference to Lowood School from Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre, although in Witch Week the miserable conditions of the school are often used for comic effect.\nIn almost every version of the book published, the class the story focuses on has a different name, according to the age group the publishers were aiming the book at the time. For instance:\nThe current UK edition calls the class 3Y, which suggests they are in the third year of secondary school and therefore around thirteen.\nAnother British edition, published by Collins in 2000, calls it 2Y, which suggests that they are in the second year of secondary school and therefore around twelve.\nThe current US edition calls it 6B, which implies the children are in the sixth grade and therefore about eleven.\nIn 1991, Ruth Waterhouse, for Children's Literature Association Quarterly, wrote \"for a writer to explore with and for children sophisticated concepts such as how fiction is encoded and decoded is a bold venture. Yet encoding and decoding is an area that Diana Wynne Jones tackles with great panache and hilarious humor in Witch Week (1982). If one were to advertise the book by saying that she is drawing on theoretical concepts developed by Saussure, Foucault, and others, most readers would be discouraged, to put it mildly. In fact Wynne Jones develops the text in such a way that the concepts are conveyed through a discourse which provides great fun for young readers, while also challenging adults to rethink some of the easily ignored yet problematic aspects of fiction-writing highlighted by recent theorists: Witch Week takes up matters such as the very nature of language as it functions via the arbitrary relationship between signifiers and what they signify, and so how we (mis)read a text; and the self-reflexive nature of a novel, as it plays with our presuppositions about how a fictional world relates to the one we are stuck with, especially as regards such seemingly inflexible features as its history and geography\".\nEarly in 1992, the science fiction writer Orson Scott Card reviewed reissues of several Diana Wynne Jones novels. He wrote concerning Witch Week:\n\nThus it is that underneath what seems to be rather low comedy\u2014brooms that demand to be taken riding by witches (and hoes and rakes and mops that can be ridden, but behave more like mules and pigs than noble steeds); prankster spells at about the level of magic spitwads\u2014there is a continuous foundation of truth. Children need powerful adult intervention to help them get control of their powers and keep their powers from taking control of them. Instead of using them for immediate self-gratification, the children instead have to create and respect certain limits to avoid destroying themselves and others. Not that"

Morse is intrigued by a cryptic clue relating to missing Karin Eriksson, which is taken to mean she has been murdered. He is given the case and notes that the clue seems to include a reference to Wytham Woods, where he believed the police should have searched in the first place.

The Way Through the Woods is a crime novel by Colin Dexter, the tenth novel in the Inspector Morse series. It received the Gold Dagger Award in 1992.\nThe novel was adapted for television in 1995, as an episode of the Inspector Morse series.\nThis book marks the death from natural causes of Morse's pathologist friend Max, whose full name is revealed as Maximillian de Bryn.\n1992, London: Macmillan ISBN\u00a00-333-58373-6, pub. date 9 October 1992, hardback\nThe television adaptation guest-starred Nicholas Le Provost as Hardinge, Neil Dudgeon as Michaels, Michelle Fairley as Cathy and Christopher Fairbank as Daley. Karin Eriksson became English girl Karen Anderson, a more unstable character who had been sexually abused by her father and served time in jail for murdering him. A subplot was added dealing with conflict between Morse and the original investigating officer, DCI Johnson (played by Malcolm Storry), who pinned Karen's murder on Steven Parnell, a serial killer responsible for four other deaths, and tried to beat a confession out of Phillip for his father's murder. Phillip's suicide was omitted but a more violent and dramatic ending added where Cathy kills both Daley and Michaels to protect her secret, finally perishing from a shot from her own gun when Morse knocks it out of her hands as she threatens him and Lewis.\n\nBishop, David, The Complete Inspector Morse: From the Original Novels to the TV Series London: Reynolds & Hearn (2006)  ISBN\u00a01-905287-13-5"

The Jewel That Was Ours is a crime novel by Colin Dexter, the ninth novel in Inspector Morse series. This novel was written by Dexter after he wrote a screenplay for an episode titled The Wolvercote Tongue in series 2 of the television programme Inspector Morse.\nReviews in 1992 were mixed. One compared this with the prior novel, finding it a step down, though still a strong story. The other compared it with the plot in the television episode aired in 1987, and found the novel far better as to plot twists.\nChief Inspector Morse: He is the lead police detective for the events among the tour.\nSergeant Lewis: He is the partner of Morse, skilled at organization.\nMax: Police pathologist who has been with Oxford police as long as Morse.\nChief Superintendent Strange: Morse reports to him.\nSergeant Dixon: He is on the staff who assist Morse.\nTour organizers and presenters\nJohn Ashendon: Leader of the tour. He is person with a side interest he will not discuss openly, confessing it only in a letter to Morse at the end.\nSheila Williams: She is a liaison and event organiser for the university. She has been having an affair with Kemp.\nDr Theodore Kemp: Curator at the Ashmolean Museum. He is about to publish a book on the Wolvercote tongue and buckle. He is known as a philanderer at Oxford.\nMarion Kemp: She is Kemp\u2019s wife. She lost her pregnancy and is wheelchair bound and housebound since an auto accident caused by her husband two years earlier.\nCedric Downes: He is an expert on English architecture of past centuries. He uses a hearing aid in his right ear.\nLucy Downes: She is the wife of Cedric. She is 11 years younger than her husband, and rumoured as the last lover of Kemp.\nRetired Americans on tour of historic cities of England\nEddie Stratton: Married to Laura for about two years.\nLaura Stratton: Married to Eddie, her second husband. She is on the tour to give the Wolvercote tongue to the museum, as directed in the will of her first husband.\nPhil Aldrich: He is a quiet man.\nJanet Roscoe: She is petite, and vociferous, speaking up with her knowledge of England and its history.\nHoward and Shirley Brown: They become friends with the Strattons on the tour.\nSam and Vera Kronquist: One of the few married couples on this tour.\nNancy Wiseman: She occasionally sits next to Phil, and writes home to her daughter as the tour proceeds.\nKirkus Reviews felt that \u201cthis effort succeeds best in the small details\u2014e.g., the use of a hearing aid as a clue\u2014while being somewhat slapdash and sketchy in its character analysis and dialogue. Less impressive than the eight previous Morse stories, and far less adroit than Dexter's handling of The Wench is Dead.\u201d\nEntertainment Weekly found this novel to be better than televised version, with more twists to the plot and the American characters less \u201cirritating caricatures\u201d than in the television programme, and he remarks on the \"tart narration\" by Dexter. In contrast to the televised story, the novel The Jewel That Was Ours, \u201cMorse makes these same deductions only to find himself utterly, shamefully wrong \u2014 a delicious moment \u2014 before groping his way to the new, improved solution: an emotion-loaded switcheroo worthy of Agatha Christie.\u201d\nMost of the story is set in Oxford, much at the Randolph Hotel, which is across the street from the Ashmolean Museum. The city of Bath is another setting for this novel. It is November 1990. Morse is 55 years old, the tourists from America are 65 to 75 years old, and the staff for the tour, including the Oxford dons are mid 30s to mid 40s in age. The narrative includes much description of Oxford and its highlights.\nThe Wolvercote Tongue is based on the Alfred Jewel, which is held at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Wolvercote is a village that is very close to Oxford.\nThe episode of the Inspector Morse TV series which corresponds to the novel is entitled The Wolvercote Tongue (screened season 2, 1987). Unique among the series, the book was written four years after the corresponding TV episode, for which Dexter had created the story. Colin Dexter offers different solutions to the same murder, in this novel compared to the earlier television episode.\n1991, London: Macmillan ISBN\u00a00-333-43139-1, Pub date 11 July 1991, Hardback\n1992, New York: Crown Publishers ISBN\u00a00-517-58847-1, Pub date 24 March 1992, Hardback\n\"The Jewel That Was Ours by Colin Dexter, Review\".

Fasting, Feasting is a novel by Indian writer Anita Desai, first published in 1999 in Great Britain by Chatto and Windus. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for fiction in 1999.\nThe novel was well-received by critics. In an initial review for India Today, Jyoti Arora wrote \"A certain starkness of vision, an uncompromising realism and superbly evocative images are immediately striking in the novel.\"\nFor Salon, Sylvia Brownrigg wrote, \"Fasting, Feasting\" is a novel not of plot but of comparison. In beautifully detailed prose Desai draws the foods and textures of an Indian small town and of an American suburb. In both, she suggests, family life is a complex mixture of generosity and meanness, license and restriction: The novel's subtle revelation is in the unlikely similarities.\"\nThe day after JM Coetzee's novel, Disgrace, was announced as the winner of the 1999 Booker Prize, in an article for The Guardian, John Sutherland, Professor of English at University College, London, leaked hints of divisions and encampments on the panel \u2014 so incurring the wrath of the other judges, who wrote furious articles of their own, lambasting him for his indiscretion. The jury was divided and the two female judges, writers Shena Mackay and Natasha Walter, were convinced the Fasting, Feasting should take the prize.

Advise and Consent is a 1959 political fiction novel by Allen Drury that explores the United States Senate confirmation of controversial Secretary of State nominee Robert Leffingwell, whose promotion is endangered due to growing evidence\u2014explored in the novel\u2014that the nominee had been a member of the Communist Party. The chief characters' responses to the evidence, and their efforts to spread or suppress it, form the basis of the novel.\nThe novel spent 102 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1960 and was adapted into a successful 1962 film starring Henry Fonda. It was followed by Drury's A Shade of Difference in 1962, and four additional sequels.\nThe novel's title comes from the United States Constitution's Article II, Sec. 2, cl. 2, which provides that the President of the United States \"shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States . . . .\"\nDrury believed most Americans were naive about the dangers of the Soviet-led communist threat to undermine the government of the United States:\nDrury believed that the Soviet Union led an international totalitarian communist movement whose ultimate goal was world domination and that communists were willing to achieve that goal by whatever moral, immoral, or amoral means worked, including propaganda, lies, subversion, intimidation, infiltration, betrayal, and violence. A Drury thesis was that American liberalism contributed to communism's incremental success in its war against American democratic capitalism.\nAdvise and Consent is a fictional account of the nomination of a prominent liberal, Robert Leffingwell, to the cabinet position of Secretary of State during the height of the Cold War. It is said that the story is based on Drury's first-hand insight into the personalities and political practices of the late-1950s including the 1954 episode wherein Senators Styles Bridges and Herman Welker threatened to publicize a homosexual in Senator Lester Hunt's family if Hunt did not resign from the Senate.\n\nIn fact, the website of the U.S. Senate states: \nBased on Drury\u2019s observations, one may guess who the author based his fictional senators on: Alben Barkley may be the dashing majority leader; Robert Taft might be the minority leader; Kenneth McKellar may be the southern senator; the overzealous Senator Fred Van Ackerman might be a caricature of Joseph McCarthy; and the tragic Brigham Anderson, who kills himself in his Senate office, reminds us of Senator Lester Hunt of Wyoming, who took his life in the Russell Building in 1954. The president and vice president strongly resemble President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President Harry Truman. The entire incident could be loosely based on the Chambers-Hiss case.\n However, the book is not meant to be a roman a clef, and it does not purport to disguise a true story. Drury considered his fictional senators and others as composites, and wove them through successive books.  The author was not interested in profiling any one individual but in capturing the whole gallery of stock characters that Washington had seen and would be seeing again.\nSeveral sources agree that character Robert Leffingwell, the novel's nominee for Secretary of State, represents Alger Hiss.\nAddressing the suggestion that the book was a roman \u00e0 clef, Drury wrote a very sharply worded preface which was only published in the new edition:\nYou will have to take the writer's word for it, because it is true. There are people and events in this book as in any that are akin to people and events in reality, but they are not the people and events of reality. Such resemblances as they do bear are transmuted through the observations and perceptions and understandings of the author into something far beyond and basically far different from the originals in the cases were originals can be argued to exist.\nSaturday Review said of Advise and Consent in August 1959 that \"It may be a long time before a better one comes along.\" Roger Kaplan of Policy Review wrote in 1999 that the novel \"in many ways invented a genre in fiction\u2026. The use of a racy intrigue, if possible involving both sex and foreign policy, is what characterizes the contemporary form. Forty years on, Advise and Consent is the only book of this genre that a literary-minded person really ought to read.\" Richard L. Neuberger reviewed the novel for The New York Times in 1959, writing that \"rarely has a political"

The story begins in a city where every evening every person hooks up to the power grid via an armband and given energy, which helps them last until the next power up. The heroine, whose name isn't revealed, works as a pixel. Her job involves standing in a giant grid, while wearing a special suit. The suit's arms have flaps of several different colors, and via headphones she is given instructions on which colors to display. With several hundred pixels each displaying a color while standing on the grid, it forms a giant telescreen which displays advertisements for 20 minutes each day. The heroine's best friend is Eve, also a coworker. One day, after a power up, the heroine finds that due to a blunder on Eve's part during the 20 minute show, Eve has been denied her energy packet for the day. Since Eve didn't have a backup packet, she didn't get energy and is now rapidly losing the will to function and live. The heroine has no choice but to drag Eve to a black market dealer who illegally sells energy packets and can administer them through a portable power up machine. The heroine and Eve barely have enough money to cover the cost of the energy packet, but Eve's life is saved. Suddenly, a mysterious individual shows up and kills the black market dealers with advanced weaponry. After some deliberation, he spares the heroine and Eve.\nAfter the incident, Eve starts acting more and more strangely. Eventually she disappears and after some time her body is found in a sewage drain. The heroine is saddened by this event and decides to seek answers. She learns of the rumor of The Factory, a mysterious place where the energy is supposedly produced and then sent. She also hears rumors about people who live in abandoned skyscrapers and don't rely on any energy packets to survive. She travels up one of these skyscrapers. After riskily getting around a broken flight of stairs by climbing on the outside of the skyscraper, she encounters a man who derisively refers to her as a \"synthetic\". However, he is impressed by the risk she took getting up the skyscraper and invites her to an event in one of the skyscrapers where synthetics go to try to get over their dependence on the energy packets. After asking one of her friends whether he'd be willing to share even a small portion of his energy packet with everyone, she realizes the addictive properties of the energy and decides to go.\nThe event turns out to be a rave supervised by the people who have learned to live on their own energy. The heroine sees many people and recognizes that the journey up to the event is a big risk since there isn't enough time to get back down in time for the power up. The heroine, due to her work as a pixel where she has to rely on the beat of the commands, feels the beat of the music and feels energy flowing through her. In a moment of euphoria she climbs onto the stage and her newly discovered self energy is powerful enough to make the old projector lights on the roof work at full power. After the event, she is adopted by the wild people. The wild people live in the tops of the abandoned skyscrapers, and live like birds. They rely on flying harnesses and the wind currents to get around. The heroine learns their way of life and lives there for a while. She finds out that the Controllers, the city's police, actively try to hunt down the wild people, therefore the wild people have to stay in the safety of the skyscrapers and only go down to scavenge supplies. One day, a kid crashes while trying out his flying harness and ends up with several broken bones. The heroine goes back down to the city to try and buy painkillers, but since she has been missing for a long time, her card has been flagged and she is captured by the Controllers.\nShe is taken to the precinct. At the precinct, she is taken to the office of an agent called a Catcher who tells her that she has been misinformed, and that the Controllers only want to send the wild people to The Factory, where they belong. She is put in a cable car along with several other wild people who were captured, and sent to the factory. Since the cable car will take about a day to get to the factory, most of the wild people go to sleep for the night, except for the heroine. At midnight, she sees the cable car conductor (a synthetic) use a portable power up machine, similar to the one used by the black market dealers, to power up. However, he doesn't power up once but at least 6 times. The heroine realizes that using the illegal energy gets you addicted and that after some time all the energy in the world wouldn't be able to satisfy the addicts, which leads them to die. She realizes that this is what"

The collection includes these stories:\n\"The Kilimanjaro Device\" (originally titled \"The Kilimanjaro Machine\", first appeared in Life Magazine, January 1965)\nAfter a long drive, a man arrives in Idaho and begins to ask questions about a local who has died. In a bar, he finally finds someone who was familiar with the person he is looking for. Though the latter is never referred to by name, it becomes clear that he is none other than Ernest Hemingway. When asked why he's looking for him, the traveler reveals that his truck has the ability to travel in time. He goes further to explain that there are right graves and wrong graves; that people do not always die at the right time, and this local man is one of them. The traveler then departs to search for Hemingway, hoping to help him find a better end.\n\"The Terrible Conflagration Up at the Place\"\nA band of rebels plot to overthrow the local lordship and express their own freedom by burning down his stately home. Before they can get on with it, the lordship himself catches them in the act and invites them inside. Offering drinks, he resigns himself to let them burn his house, though bargains with them to do it the following night, so that he and his wife may still attend the theatre. The rebels ultimately agree that it is the only decent thing to do. However, before they leave the house, the lordship asks that they also spare the priceless works of art resting in the house. Before long, the complications of burning the house become too much, and the Lordship too friendly, leaving the rebel plans long forgotten.\n\"Tomorrow's Child\"\nPeter and Polly are excited about the birth of their first child, but the doctor has unfortunate news. Because of a series of malfunctions in the new birthing machines, their newborn child has been born into another dimension. While ultimately healthy, the baby's appearance is that of a small blue pyramid with tentacle-like appendages. Peter and Polly decide to take the baby home on the condition that the doctors continue ongoing work and research to try to bring their child back into his rightful dimension. Time passes, with both Peter and Polly dealing with the burden of raising their abnormal child; Polly takes it especially hard and begins drinking heavily. After almost exactly a year, the doctors give them a difficult choice. Their attempts to retrieve the baby have proved futile, but they can send Peter and Polly to the same dimension, where they would be reunited with their child, but their altered appearance would force them into solitude from the rest of society.\n\"The Women\" (originally published in Famous Fantastic Mysteries, October 1948)\nA man and his wife are at the beach, but something sinister has awakened in the water. Calling out for the man to step in the ocean, the water entity attempts to draw him to the depths. Increasingly aware of the danger, his wife does all she can to distract him from the call of the ocean. Time ticks by, the intelligence in the water growing desperate, knowing that if it cannot lure the man before he leaves today, it will be over. Storm clouds roll in, and wife believes she has won; her husband does not understand why she seems to be cheerful that their last day at the beach has been ruined. As they begin to walk away, the husband suddenly hears a drowning voice call out for help, and rushes into the water to save it. The entity envelops the man, and hours later releases his body to wash up on shore.\n\"The Inspired Chicken Motel\"\nThe narrator recalls the time he spent traveling with his family during the Great Depression. In particular, he looks back fondly on a motel where the owner was the proud owner of a chicken with the ability to tell fortunes. When the family arrives, the owner presents them with two eggs, laid only days before their arrival. On one is the raised image of a longhorn steer, and the other contains the message \u201cRest in peace. Prosperity is near.\u201d Unsure what to make of the message, but ultimately given new hope, the family sets back out on the road.\n\"Downwind from Gettysburg\" (originally published in Playboy Magazine, June 1969)\nWhen a robotic recreation of Abraham Lincoln is shot dead in a movie theater, Bayes finds the dead Lincoln in a seat on the stage, and reminisces of the past when he and Phipps worked together to create him. Bayes confronts the killer, Mr. Booth, a self-pitying man who takes pleasure in doing harm. Bayes interrogates him, finding Mr. Booth killed Lincoln to gain attention and pleasure. Bayes then takes that away from the killer, ensuring that he will gain no"

This book is the story of a cowboy, Jack Burns, who lives as a transient worker and roaming ranch hand much as the cowboys of old did, and refuses to join modern society.  He rejects much of modern technology, prefers to cut down any fence he comes across, will not carry any kind of modern identification such as a driver's license or Social Security card, and refuses to register for the draft.   When his friend Paul Bondi, who is a philosophical anarchist, is jailed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for refusing to register for the draft, Burns deliberately gets himself arrested in an attempt to break his friend out of jail, but winds up on the run from the law himself.\nBondi has been tried and is awaiting transport from county jail to federal prison but refuses to escape with Burns. As police have discovered that Burns has also never registered for the draft, authorities are intent on sending Burns to trial and eventually federal prison for violation of the Selective Service Act of 1948. Burns eventually escapes reluctantly leaving his friend behind.  After a brief stop to say goodbye to Paul's wife, Jerry, and son, Seth, Jack heads into the Sandia Mountains, just east of Albuquerque, on horseback.\nThe police mount a manhunt and pull out all the stops to capture Burns, including helicopters on loan by the Air Force. If Burns can scale the mountain range, he figures he can escape under the cover of the forest on the other side. The police know this as well, so they position themselves to prevent that from happening.\nMany casual fans of Abbey might consider George Washington Hayduke as the author's favorite character, but it was John W. \"Jack\" Burns who Abbey kept writing about. Burns is introduced in The Brave Cowboy. He is also a major character in Abbey's science fiction novel, Good News. Burns makes cameo appearances in both The Monkey Wrench Gang and Hayduke Lives!.\nThe Brave Cowboy also contains elements of future books, though the relationship between them is unclear. The Brave Cowboy explains that Burns is the grandson of Henry Vogelin, whose ranch Burns spent time on as a child. The ranch, currently in the hands of the US Air Force is part of a base commanded by General DeSalius. Vogelin and DeSalius will be characters six years later in Abbey's 1962 work Fire on the Mountain, the story of a boy from the East Coast who visits his grandfather's ranch and falls in love with the desert and ranch life just in time to see both destroyed by development. However, Burns's time on the ranch is well detailed in Brave Cowboy and the only characters the stories share are Vogelin and DeSalius. Though the book is written as a memoir, Jack seems too old to have been the boy staying on the ranch at the moment of dispossession. Having written Fire On The Mountain after The Brave Cowboy, Abbey chose to write about the child \"Billy\" rejecting the option of using the novel to explain the past of Jack Burns. Yet it is still possible that the novels are directly linked, as the number of Vogelin's children is never revealed. Jack and Billy may be cousins or brothers, and the Vogelin and ranch in question may indeed be the same in both novels.\nThe first edition of the book is considered the rarest of Abbey's eight novels. There was only one printing of 5,000 copies and many of them have not survived.  One online rare book dealer shows copies of the first U.S. edition start at $4,000 and the highest asking price is $10,000.\nKirk Douglas gave the film version of The Brave Cowboy the title Lonely Are the Brave, his personal favorite. It was adapted by Academy Award-winning\u2014and formerly blacklisted\u2014screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. Released in 1962, it is one of only two films made based on Abbey's novels. British writer/director/actor Alex Cox has lauded the film, writing that \"there is no greater western, and certainly no more tragic one.\" \nThe second Abbey adaptation was Fire on the Mountain, which was a made-for-TV movie that starred Ron Howard and Buddy Ebsen. A third film, based on Abbey's most popular novel, The Monkey Wrench Gang, is currently in development. Catherine Hardwicke is scheduled to direct the film.\nJames M.

The opening steps back to near the ending of Change of Command; the loyalists in the weapons lab on Copper Mountain (which planet has just been taken over by mutineers) have finished sending out their radio transmission, which unbeknownst to them will indeed be picked by an escaping loyalist Fleet warship, and are wondering what to do next. Their transportation is ruined, so they decide to steal one from the mutineers. They stage a series of movements and radio transmissions intended to convince the mutineers that the weapons labs are being progressively taken over by their own.\nDisabled, the Bonar Tighe is easy prey. The loyalists are rescued. For her services to Fleet past and present, Cecelia jokingly demands to be made an Admiral - a nod to a running joke in the series where various Fleet underlings become convinced (by how they keep showing up in the thick of things) that either Cecelia or Heris is really a special operations undercover admiral ferreting out traitors for Fleet.\nFinally at Rockhouse, Esmay meets up with Brun and her own father General Casimir Suiza, who had brought along with him all the necessary apparatus to transfer Esmay's status as LandBride to her cousin Luci.\nAdmiral Arash Livadhi this entire time has been growing increasingly uneasy. He had unfortunately been close to Lepescu when he was a younger officer, and fears every day that the investigation into the Lepescu-inspired mutineers will damn him as well; he is further compromised by the fact that his closest friend Jules had been a Benignity deep agent, who had solely manipulated him into breaking rules and then through blackmail into becoming a Benignity agent.\nLivadhi takes off. His ship begins bouncing around the Familias, attempting to throw off followers. Suiza follows in her Rascal, and is hidden by Koutsoudas foxing the scans aboard Livadhi's cruiser. In the last system before the Benignity proper, Suiza powers up her weapons when she sees what is suspected to be a Benignity vessel entering the system."

The book is the result of a collaboration between Chris Clearfield, a former derivatives trader, and Andr\u00e1s Tilcsik, a professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. Clearfield and Tilcsik took top honors in the 2015 competition for The Financial Times and McKinsey Bracken Bower Prize with their proposal for a book about how to understand systemic risk and prevent catastrophic failures in business and beyond. The following year, they signed with Penguin Press to publish Meltdown.\nThe first three chapters of the book extend Charles Perrow\u2019s normal accident theory\u2014originally developed in the 1980s\u2014to recent trends, such as the rise of social media, the increasing reliance of organizations on computer-based systems, and the growing complexity of modern financial, transportation, and communication systems. The authors warn that companies, governments, and even individuals have become dangerously reliant on complex, tightly coupled systems and are ignoring simple fixes that could avert both accidents and intentional wrongdoing.\nEach of the remaining chapters focuses on a different set of solutions: designing more transparent and loosely coupled systems (Chapter 4); using structured decision tools (Chapter 5); learning from near misses and other warning signs (Chapter 6); encouraging dissent and skepticism (Chapter 7); building diverse teams (Chapter 8); learning from outsiders (Chapter 9); and preparing for and managing crises more effectively (Chapter 10).\nIn the epilogue, the authors state that humanity is in \u201cthe golden age of meltdowns\u201d: though modern systems give us tremendous capabilities, they also make us vulnerable to unexpected system failures. Clearfield and Tilcsik, however, express optimism about the future and argue that the solutions are within reach. At the same time, they caution that putting the necessary solutions into practice is difficult because doing so often goes against our natural instincts and violates persistent organizational and cultural norms.\nThe book combines analyses of case studies with summaries of social science research, drawing on academic studies, accident reports, and original interviews. The case studies include, for example, a failed social media campaign at Starbucks, a Thanksgiving dinner gone awry, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the Flint water crisis, Nasdaq\u2019s botched handling of the Facebook IPO, the accidents of the space shuttles Challenger and Columbia, the electronic trading meltdown of Knight Capital, the crashes of flights ValuJet 592 and Air France 447, and the June 2009 Washington Metro train collision. The academic research covered in the book comes from sociology, psychology, behavioural economics, organizational theory, and neuroscience, including studies by Charles Perrow, Diane Vaughan, Karl Weick, Amy Edmondson, Dacher Keltner, Gary Klein, Gregory Berns, Daniel Kahneman, and Georg Simmel, among others.\nThe Financial Times called Meltdown \"an exciting and insightful analysis of why things go wrong and how to avoid catastrophe\" and selected it as one of the books of 2018. David A. Shaywitz, reviewing the book in The Wall Street Journal, concluded that \"Meltdown effectively conveys why addressing systemic failures is both difficult and essential: difficult because it\u2019s so much more comfortable to rely on gut instinct and trust familiar colleagues than to insist on structured approaches and solicit the views of others; essential because we are moving into the danger zone and need all the help we can get.\" Shaywitz called the book\u2019s examples \"illuminating\" and noted that \"where Meltdown really hits its stride is in taking on the factors that promote groupthink and discourage dissent.\"\nLeigh Buchanan, editor-at-large at Inc. magazine, named Meltdown as one of the \"eight books you need to read in 2018\" and described it as \"admirably evidence-based.\" Tim Harford picked Meltdown as one of his books of 2019, writing that \"Meltdown is fun, wide-ranging, vivid and full of clever observations.... I strongly recommend the book.\" Writing for Forbes.com, Brook Manville called Meltdown \"a thought-provoking new book\" and wrote that the authors \"colorfully explain why your job, like everyone else\u2019s in today\u2019s global economy, is becoming part of bigger networks of co-dependent systems, laden with"

Woods is a follower of the Austrian School of economics and believes in allowing the market to freely compete in currency, which he believes would lead to mostly gold-based currency. The book is dedicated to Murray Rothbard and Ron Paul.  The book debuted at #16 on the \"Hardcover, non-fiction\" New York Times Best Seller list, and advanced to the #11 spot in its second week on the list. According to the author's official website, Meltdown was on the NYT Best Seller list for 10 weeks.\nWoods' thesis maintains that: deflation of prices neither causes nor prolongs depressions; deflation may be necessary to prevent depressions or to bring depressions to an end; the Fed is the primary cause of business cycles via its arbitrary and coercive control of the money supply; and trying to cure these credit cycles with more government intervention will not work.\nWoods argues that government intervention in the form of support for housing and excessive monetary expansion caused the current crisis. By creating an illusion of wealth (that certain resources exist which do not exist), interventions encourage wasteful investments and unsustainable consumption, instead of productive investments. The proposed cures (bailouts, more money creation, and stimulus spending) will just make matters worse. No business is really too big to fail, he says, even large financial institutions.  For them, as for other businesses, liquidation is preferable to a bailout from the perspective of the larger economy.\nAccording to Woods, the depressions of the 19th century were caused by banks (various state banks and the Second Bank of the United States) issuing paper money, supposedly convertible to gold, in amounts greatly exceeding their gold reserves.\nGreat Recession in the United States\nThe Politically Incorrect Guide to American History\n\"Hardcover Nonfiction: Best Sellers.\" New York Times. 27 February 2009. \nSee section \"Boom and bust before the Fed\" on pages 88 to 94.\nMeltdown: A Free-Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed, the Economy Tanked, and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse (2009) ISBN\u00a01-5969-8587-9 & ISBN\u00a0978-1-59698-587-2\nWashington Times review\nWoods at Mises.org\nSource of some statistics used in Meltdown\nISBNdb.com review\nlewrockwell.com review\nAnother free market view of the crisis"

Unlike The Silmarillion, also published posthumously (in 1977), for which the narrative fragments were modified to connect into a consistent and coherent work, the Unfinished Tales are presented as Tolkien left them, with little more than names changed (the author having had a confusing habit of trying out different names for a character while writing a draft). Thus some of these are incomplete stories, while others are collections of information about Middle-earth. Each tale is followed by a long series of notes explaining inconsistencies and obscure points.\nAs with The Silmarillion, Christopher Tolkien edited and published Unfinished Tales before he had finished his study of the materials in his father's archive. Unfinished Tales provides more detailed information about characters, events and places mentioned only briefly in The Lord of the Rings. Versions of such tales, including the origins of Gandalf and the other Istari (Wizards), the death of Isildur and the loss of the One Ring in the Gladden Fields, and the founding of the kingdom of Rohan, help expand knowledge about Middle-earth.\nThe commercial success of Unfinished Tales demonstrated that the demand for Tolkien's stories several years after his death was not only still present but growing. Encouraged by the result, Christopher Tolkien embarked upon the more ambitious twelve-volume work entitled The History of Middle-earth which encompasses nearly the entire corpus of his father's writings about Middle-earth.\n\n\"Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin\"\n\"Narn i H\u00een H\u00farin (The Tale of the Children of H\u00farin)\"\n\"A Description of the Island of N\u00famenor\"\n\"Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife\"\n\"The Line of Elros: Kings of N\u00famenor\"\n\"The History of Galadriel and Celeborn\"\n\"The Disaster of the Gladden Fields\"\n\"Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan\"\n\"The Quest of Erebor\"\n\"The Hunt for the Ring\"\n\"The Battles of the Fords of Isen\"\n\"The Dr\u00faedain\"\n\"The Istari\"\n\"The Palant\u00edri\"\nThe scholar Paul H. Kocher, reviewing Unfinished Tales in Mythlore, notes that all the stories are linked to either The Silmarillion, Akallabeth or The Lord of the Rings, and extensively annotated, mainly by Christopher Tolkien. In Kocher's view, the stories contain \"some of Tolkien's best writing\" (and he summarizes them in some detail), though there is much of interest in the editorial material also. He notes the revised map with the additional placenames used in the tales, and that the book does not address Tolkien's poetry.\nThe Tolkien scholar Corey Olsen notes that Christopher Tolkien chose to present the incomplete tales as they were, adding a commentary to help readers grasp how they fitted in to his father's Middle-earth legendarium. Olson comments that the book's commercial success demonstrated the existence of a market for more of Tolkien's writings, opening up a route to publication of the 12-volume The History of Middle-earth.\nPerry Bramlett adds that the book is not for the reader new to Tolkien, nor even one who has read only The Hobbit \"or perhaps some or even all of the Lord of the Rings.\" He notes Christopher Tolkien's warning that the stories \"constitute no whole\" and that much of the content \"will be found unrewarding\" to those without a good knowledge of Lord of the Rings. More positively, he cites David Bratman's comment that much of it is as well-crafted as any of Tolkien's writings, and that readers who found The Silmarillion \"a little too high and distant\" would welcome it.\nKocher, Paul H.

Iron Council is one of China Miville's most overtly political novels, being strongly inspired by the anti-globalization movement, and tackling issues such as imperialism, corporatism, terrorism, racial hatred, homosexuality, culture shock, labour rights and war.

Iron Council follows three major narrative threads that join to form the novel's climax. Although Mi\u00e9ville weaves back and forth between narrative, time and space, this summary will follow each narrative individually, discussing their relation to each other toward the end. The novel is set in and around New Crobuzon, a sprawling London-esque city. New Crobuzon has for some unknown time been at war with Tesh, and is attempting to build a railroad across the outlying desert, partially as a new means of conducting this war. Against this backdrop, the novel follows the deeds of three main characters\u2014Ori, Cutter and Judah Low.\nJudah's story begins some 20 years before the novel's opening. Judah was hired as a railroad scout for New Crobuzon, charged with mapping terrain and informing the land's inhabitants of the railroad's coming. While doing so, he spends time with the Stiltspear, a race of indescribable creatures who can conjure golems, living creatures made from unliving matter. Judah attempts to warn the Stiltspear away, but they will not listen and he must settle for making a few recordings and beginning to learn their golemetric arts. Eventually, he returns to the railroad, which does indeed wipe out the Stiltspear. Shortly afterward, Judah, a sex worker named Ann-Hari, and a Remade named Uzman lead a revolution in which the rail workers drive the overseers away, free the Remade, and hijack the train, transforming it into a moving socialist dwelling.\nIron Council, the perpetual train, moves through the desert, gathering track from behind and laying it in whichever direction its citizens decide. The Council keeps moving to avoid the New Crobuzon militia, who are anxious to reclaim the train and destroy the rebellion-inspiring Council. Judah returns to New Crobuzon, where he immerses himself in esoteric golemetry literature, emerging as a master of the art. Eventually, Judah returns to the Iron Council, having spread its word throughout New Crobuzon, intent on using his golemetry to protect it.\nCutter, whom the reader joins at the novel's opening, was a friend, disciple, and lover to Judah during Judah's return to New Crobuzon. He leads a group consisting of other disciples of Judah in search of the Iron Council to warn of an impending attack by the New Crobuzon militia. After living and working with the Council for a while, Cutter returns with Judah and others to New Crobuzon to inspire revolt with the news of Iron Council, which has decided to return to the city and confront the militia on its own turf. In their travels they meet Qurabin, a monk of the Moment of the Hidden and Lost, who continually trades aspects of himself in return for whatever knowledge he needs (over the course of the novel, Qurabin loses his native language, various memories, and finally his eyes to help the protagonists).\nMeanwhile, dissatisfied revolutionary Ori is led by a half-crazed old homeless man named Spiral Jacobs to join the militant gang of Toro. Committing robberies, raids, and even murder, Toro's group proceeds mercilessly on its quest to assassinate the mayor of New Crobuzon, a plan which is later revealed to be personal rather than political. During Ori's struggles with and against his new gang, an uprising by the Collective, a union of revolutionary groups, threatens to finally wrest New Crobuzon from the hands of its corrupt parliament and militia. After several days of fighting, however, the Collective is destroyed. Ori then learns that Spiral Jacobs is actually a powerful sorcerer sent by Tesh to introduce a dark, destructive force into the midst of New Crobuzon. Here Judah, Ori, and Cutter unite to stop Jacobs with the help of Qurabin, who takes the Tesh ambassador with him 'into the domain of Tekke Vogu'. Ori is killed in the confrontation. \nIn light of the collapse of the Collective, Judah sends Cutter to dissuade Iron Council from returning. He is unsuccessful, and Judah conjures a time-golem to freeze the train in time to save its citizens. Ann Hari murders Judah shortly thereafter for thwarting the attack. As the novel ends, Iron Council has become a public monument of sorts, poised on the verge of attacking New Crobuzon until the unknown moment when the time golem dissipates. Cutter re-immerses himself in New Crobuzon's underground resistance movements, revitalising the protest publication Runagate Rampant.\nSteven Poole reviewed the book for The Guardian and suggested that \"in comparison with The Scar, such ideas are fewer and less"

                "description": "Tales of Hulan River (Chinese: ; pinyin: H ln h zhun) was the last work written by Xiao Hong, one of the most talented female literary figures of the Chinese Northeastern Writers Group that were especially active in the 1930s and 1940s. The novel was first serialized in a Hong Kong newspaper and then came out as a book, after which it received both criticism and praise. Written in a poetical and vividly descriptive language, Tales of Hulan River delineates a world inside a rural town of Northeast China. The story is unfolded through the perspective of a young child, starting from the overall natural and societal environment to images of the compound where the narrator lives. ...",

The first time this novel was formulated could be traced back to 1936 when Xiao Hong was still in Japan, and she started writing it in 1937 in Wuhan before she moved to Chongqing. However, as the Second Sino-Japanese War spread to Chongqing, Xiao Hong was forced to flee again and in 1940 with Duanmu Hongliang (\u7aef\u6728\u857b\u826f), they went to Hong Kong, a British colony at that time. After fleeing between several cities across China, it is in Hong Kong where Xiao Hong was extremely far away from her birthplace in Northeast China that she accomplished her last novel Tales of Hulan River to reminisce the hometown she might never have a chance to go back to.\nAt that time when Xiao Hong was writing Tales of Hulan River, the majority of Chinese writers devoted themselves to wartime literature to struggle against the Japanese invaders, hence most of their works have shifted from the realm of art to the genre of propaganda. However, Xiao Hong still pursued her unique writing style and persisted in composing truly artistic and philosophical literature. This novel is considered to be an autobiographical work in remembrance of Xiao Hong's childhood in Manchuria, where her own experience was thought to be indirectly revealed by stories of the characters surrounding the narrator. The whole book is mostly built upon fact but there are also other opinions that fact and fiction are mixed within the whole story.\nThis novel is marked with the characteristics that there is no single threat and central figure throughout the seven chapters. Instead, each fragmented chapter is drawn together based on the same space-time dimension and through the eye of the child narrator who comes on stage in chapter 3. A camera-like scene full of immersive details is consummately presented by the author.\nThese two chapters delineate an overall societal picture and natural environment of the Hulan town.\nChapter 1 begins with the extremely frozen winter and then turns to the group portrait of various natives including the peddler, the physician Li Yongchun, widow Wang, etc., and their everyday life. The town is depicted as a closed society, where those natives all deaden to the surrounding world and lives of others [my translation]. One of the most sobering scenes centers around everyone's detachment toward that quagmire and its result in several calamities. The background and characteristics of these people are vague, where they are labeled as functional parts that constitute the society without any human agency and identity. Chapter 2 mainly narrates the story of how people in Hulan town are involved in several local events and festivals, revealing some of the pervasive superstitions in traditional beliefs. One of the events, the dance of the sorceress plays a significant role in plot development in Chapter 5.\nChapter 3 and 4 turn to describe the narrator's family and other people living in the compound.\nChapters 3 is particularly devoted to the narrator's grandfather, but those warm scenes are only a transient flashback throughout the whole book [my translation]. \"I\" enjoy playing in the garden, studying poetry, and eating different food cooked by my granddad. This chapter also depicts many other narrator's family members including the narrator's grandmum who died because of her illness. \"I\" dislike her as she cannot bear my naughty behavior. Chapter 4 then turns to portray the narrator's family compound and how different types of tenants live their lives. The house consists of seven axisymmetric buildings standing in a line with a gateway in the middle that appears to be imposing, along with six more shabby rooms, three dilapidated huts, and three milling sheds. But it is viewed to be dreary from the perspective of the young narrator, where the narrator repeated it several times throughout the chapter. The tenants dwelling in are described as coarse individuals including hog farmers, bean-flour sifters, a miller, a carter and his family.\nThe last three chapters are respectively unfolded surrounding three characters: The child bride, Second Uncle You, and Harelip Feng.\nChapter 5 is a tragic story of Xiao Tuan Yuan, an arranged child bride of the carter family. Once she arrives, many people feel curious about her and want to have a look. After a few days, the child bride's mother-in-law starts to beat her, making her become even more of the focal topic of conversation among neighbors. Later, she is then thought to be \"sick\" and the dance of the sorceress is set up to drive away from the evil spirit together with loads of special potions and magical charms offered by different people, but the child bride's illness becomes more serious so a soothsayer is invited. However, nothing seems to work and the sicker the child bride is thought to be, the harder her"

As a result of Wells's earlier books and articles, he was \"bombarded with requests for pieces on socialism.\"  Many of the chapters of New Worlds for Old are reworked versions of these pieces.  He told an American publisher that his intended audience was intelligent young people, especially those living in the United States.\nNew Worlds for Old identifies two \"Main Generalizations of Socialism\":  (1) \"The ideas of the private individual rights of the parent and of his isolated responsibility for his children are harmfully exaggerated in the contemporary world.\"  (2) \"The idea of the private ownership of things and the rights of owners is enormously and mischievously exaggerated in the contemporary world.\"\nWells advocates the replacement of a \"social system, based on Private Ownership\" with one based on the \"spirit of service,\" arguing that this will be more productive as well as more just.  He devotes several chapters to addressing objections to socialism, then analyzes the history of socialism.\nWells places the origins of socialism in \"a disconnected series of protests against the extreme theories of Individualism and Individualist Political Economy\" and notes that the word dates from 1835; in its initial phase, he says, it was \"immediately revolutionary\" and teemed with \"rash, suggestive schemes.\"  This early phase was ended by Karl Marx, who, influenced by evolutionary thinking, \"for the first time viewed our age of individualist industrial development, not as a possible permanent condition of humanity, but as something unstable and in motion, as an economic process.\"  But Wells rejects the \"revolutionary socialism\" of Marx as flawed by an exaggeration of the economic factor, an invidious concept of class warfare, and an excessive determinism.  In a following chapter, he criticizes the \"administration socialism\" of which the Fabians are an example, as excessively bureaucratic in spirit.  The label Wells gives to what he advocates is \"constructive socialism,\" which is to be realized \"through the operation of a collective mind that must by its nature be constructive and enterprising, because only through the creation of such a mind can Socialism be brought about.\"\nFor Wells, socialism is more in the nature of a religion than a political movement.  Near the end of New Worlds for Old, he writes:  \"Socialism is a moral and intellectual process, let me in conclusion reiterate that.  Only secondarily and incidentally does it sway the world of politics.  It is not a political movement; it may engender political movements, but it can never become a political movement; any political body, any organization whatever, that professes to stand for Socialism, makes an altogether too presumptuous claim. .\u00a0.\u00a0. There can be no pontifical Socialism; the theory lives and grows.  It springs out of the common sanity of mankind.\"\nNew Worlds for Old was very successful, and went through many editions; it was reprinted five times over the next six years and later went through two revisions. Leopold Bloom cites it in the \"Night Town\" section of James Joyce's Ulysses.  The book influenced an entire generation of British socialists.  It was praised by William Archer, John Galsworthy, Ray Lankester, Joseph Conrad, and many others; in a review, Arnold Bennett called it a masterly work. Helen Keller listed  New Worlds for Old as the book that made her become a socialist.\nDavid C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 101.\nDavid C.

Homeward Bound (2004) is a science fiction and alternate history novel by Harry Turtledove. It is the eighth and final work in his Worldwar series fictional universe. It follows the events of the Colonization trilogy and gives some closure to the storylines.\nHomeward Bound begins in 1972 and then flashes forward to 1977, 1982, 1984, 1994, 2012, and finally 2031, when the American starship Admiral Peary arrives at Tau Ceti and Home, the homeworld of The Race.\nHomeward Bound has multiple meanings in the book. It is a pun in that the Race's home planet is called Home, and many characters are headed there. For characters that are members of the Race, such as Ttomalss, Atvar, and Straha, they are headed home after the failed conquest of Earth. For Kassquit, it is her cultural home although not her biological one. The Earth ship Admiral Peary is headed to the planet Home, where they will confront the Race and try to demand respect as an independent planet or at least for the United States.\nAt the end of the novel, while most of the ship's crew has been in cryogenic sleep and suffered time dilation, they are given the chance to go back to Earth (their home). As the characters arrive, they handle their return as best they can.\nSam Yeager - United States Ambassador to the Race and foremost human expert on The Race.\nJonathan Yeager - Expert on The Race, member of ambassadorial team, son of Sam Yeager, married to Karen Yeager.\nKaren Yeager - Expert on The Race, married to Jonathan Yeager.\nGlen Johnson - Scooter pilot and third highest-ranking ship pilot of the Admiral Peary.\nAtvar - Fleetlord of the Race who was in charge of Conquest Fleet that originally invaded Earth (Tosev 3).\nTtomalss - Senior Researcher and psychologist of the Race. Foremost expert on the psychology of humans. \"Father\" of Kassquit.\nKassquit - Researcher for The Race, human raised in the manner of The Race, only Tosevite citizen of the Empire.\n37th Emperor Risson - The current Emperor of the Empire. (Risson is not the 37th Emperor [there have been thousands] but the 37th Emperor to bear the name \"Risson.\")\nThe Doctor - An off-screen character whose death causes Sam Yeager to assume the duties of US Ambassador to the Race. (Note: The character is generally referred to in the novel as \"The Doctor\" but is Henry Kissinger.)\nDiplomacy is a major theme of the novel. The humans spend their time trying to convince the Race that they are not dangerous barbarians. However, that mindset of the previously-technologically-superior Race will not be dissuaded. The Americans negotiate from a position of weakness, but both sides know that it is only a matter of time until that position becomes one of greater strength.\nWar, a terribly destructive war in which \"millions, and probably billions\" would  die on Earth, Home and possibly also on the Empire's two other worlds, is an ever-present possibility, but none of the negotiators on either side is especially warlike, and they are on quite good terms personally. The Admiral Peary orbits Home, loaded with nuclear missiles that could be launched to rain death and destruction on a world that had not known war for 100,000 years. Even The Race's imperial capital, with the Emperor in his palace, a shrine at the centre of The Race's religion as well a centre of government, might be obliterated, as the Emperor explicitly remarks in one scene. Actually using the missiles is clearly not the Americans' preferred option but is never ruled out.\nOn the other hand, representatives of The Race are increasingly driven to the reluctant conclusion that they must launch a war of annihilation against the humans even though they have only a very doubtful chance of winning since waiting would reduce their chance of winning to zero. However, such considerations are rendered moot by the arrival of the FTL Commodore Perry, showing the Race that time has already run out for a pre-emptive war against the \"Tosevites\".\nThe younger, newly-arrived Americans behave with a manifest arrogance of power not only towards The Race but even towards their own \"obsolete\" older countrymen and women of the Admiral Peary. However, representatives of The Race, while embarking on a desperate struggle to catch up and achieve FTL flight for themselves, are able to devise a counterdeterrence even with their existing sub-light ships. They come up with the idea of launching them to hit Earth at"

The Blythes Are Quoted employs an unusual structure. Short stories about residents of Glen St. Mary are interspersed with vignettes of Anne Shirley Blythe and her family discussing her poetry over a series of evenings. Before or after each of these vignettes, one or more of Anne's poems (and, later in the book, the poems of her son Walter) are presented in their entirety.\nThe stories themselves are not primarily about Anne or her family, though Anne and her husband, Gilbert, are at least mentioned (and often quoted) by other characters in every single story. Other members of Anne's family are also discussed upon occasion. As well, Anne has a small supporting role in one story, and Gilbert similarly has a supporting role in another. Other than the connection through Anne, however, the short stories do not narratively tie in with the poems or vignettes in any way.\nThe short stories, most of which were originally published in periodicals throughout the 1930s, focus on characters that live in or near Glen St. Mary, the village that Anne lives in as an adult. These previously published stories initially had no connection to Anne or to Glen St. Mary, but in compiling this volume, Montgomery rewrote the stories to change the settings and include mentions and appearances of Anne and her family, mostly in incidental roles. (Montgomery had used a similar tactic some thirty years earlier in compiling the collection Chronicles of Avonlea. In that volume, previously published stories were rewritten to mention and occasionally feature characters and settings from Anne of Green Gables.) The poems, most of which were likewise published under Montgomery's name in previous years, were now attributed to Anne and to Anne's son Walter for the purposes of this collection. The only completely new material specifically composed for this volume are the brief vignettes, which consist solely of dialogue between Anne, her family, and her housekeeper, Susan Baker.\nThe book returns to the characters and setting that are known to readers all around the world, but there is a noticeable shift in tone and topic, given that the book frequently deals with such matters as \"adultery, illegitimacy, despair, misogyny, murder, revenge, bitterness, hatred, aging, and death.\"\nThe book was delivered to Montgomery's Canadian publisher on the day of her death in 1942, but for reasons unexplained, the publisher declined to issue the book at the time. Montgomery scholar Elizabeth Rollins Epperly speculates that the book's dark tone and anti-war message (Anne speaks very bitterly of the Second World War in one passage) may have made the volume unpublishable in the midst of the patriotic fervour surrounding the second world war.\nAn abridged version of this book was published as a collection of short stories called The Road to Yesterday in 1974, more than thirty years after the original work had been submitted. The Road to Yesterday shortened and reorganized the stories (dropping one story entirely) and omitted all the vignettes and all but one of the poems. A paperback edition of The Road to Yesterday was published in both Canada and the U.S. in 1993.\nOn 8 April 2009, Montgomery scholar Benjamin Lefebvre announced that his edition of The Blythes Are Quoted, would be published by Viking Canada in October 2009, sixty-seven years after it had been completed. This edition contained the full text of Montgomery's final typescript and made only minimal changes to spelling and punctuation for clarity. Lefebvre also contributed an afterword to the volume, which also includes a foreword by Elizabeth Rollins Epperly. A paperback edition appeared in October 2010.\nThe volume has likewise appeared in translation. A Finnish edition, Annan j\u00e4\u00e4hyv\u00e4iset (literally Anne's Farewell), translated by Marja Helanen-Ahtola, was published by Werner S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m Osakeyhti\u00f6 in September 2010. A Polish edition, Ania z Wyspy Ksiecia Edwarda (literally Anne of Prince Edward Island), translated by Pawel Ciemniewski, was published by Wydawnictwo Literackie in May 2011. A Japanese translation, An no Omoide no Hibi (literally Anne's Days of Remembrance), translated by Mie Muraoka, was published in two volumes by Shinchosha in October 2012.\nOn 7 February 2017, Lefebvre announced on the website for L. M. Montgomery Online that a new Penguin Modern Classics Edition of The Blythes Are Quoted would be published by Penguin Canada in October 2017. The publication date was first moved to January 9, 2018, and then to April 24, 2018, to coincide with the seventy-sixth anniversary of Montgomery's death on 24 April 1942; it was then published"

Paul Gambaccini wrote regularly for Rolling Stone magazine from 1970 and established himself as a disc jockey for BBC Radio 1 in the UK. In 1977, he asked various British and American music critics, journalists, radio broadcasters and individuals from the music industry to list their top ten albums of all time. Of the 47 people who participated, according to author Clinton Heylin, 31 were music or literary critics. Among these were Robert Christgau, Jonathan Cott, Cameron Crowe, Giovanni Dadomo, Simon Frith, Charlie Gillett, Clive James, Lenny Kaye, Greil Marcus, Dave Marsh, Lisa Robinson, John Tobler, Ed Ward, Chris Welch, Richard Williams and Ellen Willis.\nFrom the 47 personal lists, Gambaccini created a top 200 list of albums. The book contains an entry for each album, with its track listing, LP cover and release information, and commentary from one of Gambaccini's contributors on its impact and significance. The top ten albums were as follows:\nThe Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)\nBob Dylan Blonde on Blonde (1966)\nBob Dylan Highway 61 Revisited (1965)\nVan Morrison Astral Weeks (1968)\nThe Beatles Rubber Soul (1965)\nThe Beatles Revolver (1966)\nThe Rolling Stones Exile on Main St. (1972)\nThe Rolling Stones Let It Bleed (1969)\nThe Beatles Abbey Road (1969)\nBruce Springsteen Born to Run (1975)\nFor the next edition of the book, Gambaccini reduced the scope to a top 100. The participants consisted of 81 critics, writers and broadcasters. Among the music critics were Frith, Gillett, Marcus, Marsh and Williams once more, and Ken Barnes, Chet Flippo, Kurt Loder, Nick Logan and Niall Stokes. The other participants included lyricist and UK chart historian Tim Rice, and several MTV video jockeys. All LP covers were reproduced in full colour. The top ten albums were as follows:\nThe Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)\nBruce Springsteen Born to Run (1975)\nBob Dylan Blonde on Blonde (1966)\nMarvin Gaye What's Going On (1971)\nBruce Springsteen Born in the U.S.A. (1984)\nElvis Presley The Sun Collection (1975)\nThe Velvet Underground The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967)\nThe Beach Boys Pet Sounds (1966)\nVan Morrison Astral Weeks (1968)\nThe Beatles The Beatles (\"White Album\") (1968)\nIn his review of the second edition, Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times wrote that he enjoyed the book but regretted that Gambaccini had chosen to include so many broadcasters and media personalities among his contributors, saying, \"Mark Goodman and Alan Hunter may delight MTV audiences, but their jobs have nothing to do with weighing good music.\" In an attempt to gauge the genuine critical response, Hilburn reduced the number of panellists to 27 \u2013 all critics and writers whose work he knew. From their personal top tens reproduced in the book, he calculated that Blonde on Blonde would have topped the list, followed by the Velvet Underground and Presley albums, with Sgt. Pepper in sixth place. In his own top ten, Hilburn placed Presley at number one and Sgt. Pepper at number four.\nWriting in his 2007 book on the legacy of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album, The Act You've Known for All These Years, Clinton Heylin criticises the choice of contributors to the 1978 edition, due to the absence of leading critics such as Lester Bangs, Richard Goldstein, Nick Kent, Paul Nelson, Charles Shaar Murray, Tony Parsons and Paul Williams. He describes Gambaccini as a \"DJ\" and claims that Gambaccini excluded these critical voices because they represented a \"challenging view of Rock\" that was at odds with his own tastes. He queries Sgt. Pepper's top ranking in the book, since the contributors' personal top tens show that Frith, Tobler and Welch were the only \"bona-fide\" critics who listed that album, whereas half of the 16 \"outsiders\", who possessed \"no critical credentials (and precious little taste)\", named it in their top four. Heylin adds that the more worthy 1979 publications The Rolling Stone Record Guide and Stranded corrected this misconception by presenting Sgt. Pepper less favourably, although he complains that the Rolling Stone book gave the album an overly generous four-star rating (out of five).\nAmid his disapproval of the acclaim afforded Sgt. Pepper in 1987, on the occasion of its 20th anniversary and first release on CD, Heylin dismisses the second edition of Gambaccini's book and similarly ridicules a contemporary list compiled by Rolling Stone writers, titled \"The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years\", that placed Sgt. Pepper at number one. He says that Gambaccini produced \"another uncritical edition of Critics' Choice\" and \"once again ... rel[ied] on some of the States' most resolutely uninformed industry figures to bolster"

The Blythes Are Quoted employs an unusual structure. Short stories about residents of Glen St. Mary are interspersed with vignettes of Anne Shirley Blythe and her family discussing her poetry over a series of evenings. Before or after each of these vignettes, one or more of Anne's poems (and, later in the book, the poems of her son Walter) are presented in their entirety.\nThe stories themselves are not primarily about Anne or her family, though Anne and her husband, Gilbert, are at least mentioned (and often quoted) by other characters in every single story. Other members of Anne's family are also discussed upon occasion. As well, Anne has a small supporting role in one story, and Gilbert similarly has a supporting role in another. Other than the connection through Anne, however, the short stories do not narratively tie in with the poems or vignettes in any way.\nThe short stories, most of which were originally published in periodicals throughout the 1930s, focus on characters that live in or near Glen St. Mary, the village that Anne lives in as an adult. These previously published stories initially had no connection to Anne or to Glen St. Mary, but in compiling this volume, Montgomery rewrote the stories to change the settings and include mentions and appearances of Anne and her family, mostly in incidental roles. (Montgomery had used a similar tactic some thirty years earlier in compiling the collection Chronicles of Avonlea. In that volume, previously published stories were rewritten to mention and occasionally feature characters and settings from Anne of Green Gables.) The poems, most of which were likewise published under Montgomery's name in previous years, were now attributed to Anne and to Anne's son Walter for the purposes of this collection. The only completely new material specifically composed for this volume are the brief vignettes, which consist solely of dialogue between Anne, her family, and her housekeeper, Susan Baker.\nThe book returns to the characters and setting that are known to readers all around the world, but there is a noticeable shift in tone and topic, given that the book frequently deals with such matters as \"adultery, illegitimacy, despair, misogyny, murder, revenge, bitterness, hatred, aging, and death.\"\nThe book was delivered to Montgomery's Canadian publisher on the day of her death in 1942, but for reasons unexplained, the publisher declined to issue the book at the time. Montgomery scholar Elizabeth Rollins Epperly speculates that the book's dark tone and anti-war message (Anne speaks very bitterly of the Second World War in one passage) may have made the volume unpublishable in the midst of the patriotic fervour surrounding the second world war.\nAn abridged version of this book was published as a collection of short stories called The Road to Yesterday in 1974, more than thirty years after the original work had been submitted. The Road to Yesterday shortened and reorganized the stories (dropping one story entirely) and omitted all the vignettes and all but one of the poems. A paperback edition of The Road to Yesterday was published in both Canada and the U.S. in 1993.\nOn 8 April 2009, Montgomery scholar Benjamin Lefebvre announced that his edition of The Blythes Are Quoted, would be published by Viking Canada in October 2009, sixty-seven years after it had been completed. This edition contained the full text of Montgomery's final typescript and made only minimal changes to spelling and punctuation for clarity. Lefebvre also contributed an afterword to the volume, which also includes a foreword by Elizabeth Rollins Epperly. A paperback edition appeared in October 2010.\nThe volume has likewise appeared in translation. A Finnish edition, Annan j\u00e4\u00e4hyv\u00e4iset (literally Anne's Farewell), translated by Marja Helanen-Ahtola, was published by Werner S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m Osakeyhti\u00f6 in September 2010. A Polish edition, Ania z Wyspy Ksiecia Edwarda (literally Anne of Prince Edward Island), translated by Pawel Ciemniewski, was published by Wydawnictwo Literackie in May 2011. A Japanese translation, An no Omoide no Hibi (literally Anne's Days of Remembrance), translated by Mie Muraoka, was published in two volumes by Shinchosha in October 2012.\nOn 7 February 2017, Lefebvre announced on the website for L. M. Montgomery Online that a new Penguin Modern Classics Edition of The Blythes Are Quoted would be published by Penguin Canada in October 2017. The publication date was first moved to January 9, 2018, and then to April 24, 2018, to coincide with the seventy-sixth anniversary of Montgomery's death on 24 April 1942; it was then published"

A Walk to Remember is a novel by American writer Nicholas Sparks, released in October 1999. The novel, set in 1958\u20131959 in Beaufort, North Carolina, is a story of two teenagers who fall in love with each other despite the disparity of their personalities. A Walk to Remember is adapted in the film of the same name.\nSparks wrote the manuscripts for A Walk to Remember, his third novel, in the summer of 1999. He wrote it in North Carolina, which is the setting of the novel. Like his first published novel The Notebook, the prologue to A Walk to Remember was written last. The title A Walk to Remember was taken from one of the tail end pages of the novel: \"In every way, a walk to remember.\" The novel is written in first-person, and its narrator is a seventeen-year-old boy, living in the 1950s.\nThe novel was inspired by Sparks' sister, Danielle Sparks Lewis, who later died of cancer in June 2000. Although the story is largely fictional, certain parts were based on real experiences. For example, his sister, just like Jamie, was never popular at school and always wore an ugly sweater. And just like Jamie, she always carried the Bible around with her everywhere she went. And just like Landon and Jamie, never in a thousand years did anyone think someone  would ever deeply fall head-over-heels for her. His sister's husband proposed marriage to her despite her sickness. After her death, Sparks said in the eulogy: \"...I suppose I wrote this novel not only so that you could get to know my sister, but so that you would know what a wonderful thing it was that her husband once did for her.\"\nLandon Carter is a son of a rich family, the narrator of the novel.\nJamie Sullivan is the daughter of the Beaufort church minister Hegbert Sullivan. She is very religious, sweet, and kind.\nMr. Carter is the father of Landon Carter. He is a congressman in North Carolina and is gone nine months out of the year because he lives in Washington D.C.\nMrs. Carter is the mother of Landon Carter. \"She [is] a nice lady, sweet and gentle.\"\nHegbert Sullivan is Jamie's father. He is the Beaufort church minister. His wife died shortly after giving birth to Jamie. He is very old with \"translucent skin\"; he is often crabby but his daughter describes him as having \"a good sense of humor\". He wrote the local play, The Christmas Angel but he maintains a strong dislike for Mr. Carter due to his father's choices.\nAngela Clark is the first girlfriend of Landon and then begins dating Lew.\n Carey Denison is the treasurer at Landon's high school as well as a tuba player. He is unproportional, with short arms, a large stomach, and a squeaky voice.\nLew is Angela Clark's boyfriend, who \"[is] twenty years old and [works] as a mechanic\" and \"always [wears] a white T-shirt with a pack of Camels folded into the sleeve\".\nMiss Garber is the drama teacher at Landon's high-school. \"She [is] big, at least 6'2\", with flaming red hair and pale skin that [shows] her freckles well into her forties.\" Her favorite word is marvelous.\nEric Hunter is Landon's best friend, who does more making fun, than being an actual friend. The popular jock at school, he starts out very crude, but when tragedy strikes his longtime friend, he shows that he is sympathetic.\nEddie Jones is not well liked by the drama department. He was scheduled to play the main character in the play, but is demoted to the \"bum\" when Landon steps in. He is extremely apathetic.\nMrs. Sullivan is a minor role. Described as \"a wispy little thing\", she died while giving birth to Jamie, and is greatly missed by Hegbert and Jamie.\nMargaret, a cheerleader, is Eric's girlfriend.\nThe novel was published in October 1999 in hardcover print, and later in paperback edition. It spent nearly six months in the best-seller list on hardcover, and an additional four months on paperback.\nThe novel received mixed reviews from critics. The Sunday New York Post holds that it \"never fails to be interesting, touching, at times riveting\u00a0... a book you won't soon forget\". African Sun Times echoes the former's comments, saying, \"A remarkable love story that, like its predecessors, will touch the hearts of readers everywhere.\" New York Daily News compliments Sparks, commenting that he \"has written a sweet tale of young but everlasting love, and though he's told us to expect both joy and sadness, the tears will still come\". Clarissa Cruz of Entertainment Weekly, however, panned the novel, saying, \"With its cliche-riddled prose and plot twists that can be predicted after skimming the prologue, Nicholas Sparks' latest, A Walk To Remember, reads more like the script for a bad"

Like Dracula, Fangland is written in parts as an epistolary novel through e-mails, diary entries and letters. It received a World Fantasy Award nomination.\nEvangeline Harker: daughter of a Texan oil magnate, who works as an associate producer on The Hour and who is sent to Transylvania to scout a possible story on Ion Torgu.

Paul Di Filippo similarly declared that Dogland \"succeeds remarkably on a number of levels as mimetic autobiography . . . , as depiction of a fantastic midsummer dreamscape, and as Arthurian reenactment\".

Go Tell It on the Mountain is a 1953 semi-autobiographical novel by James Baldwin. It tells the story of John Grimes, an intelligent teenager in 1930s Harlem, and his relationship with his family and his church. The novel also reveals the back stories of John's mother, his biological father, and his violent, fanatically religious stepfather, Gabriel Grimes. The novel focuses on the role of the Pentecostal Church in the lives of African Americans, both as a negative source of repression and moral hypocrisy and a positive source of inspiration and community. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Go Tell It on the Mountain 39th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Time Magazine included the novel on its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005.\nWhile the US was involving itself into three different wars, Korean, Cold, and Second Red Scare, The Dial Press was publishing \"Go Tell It On The Mountain\" in 1953. Baldwin decided to use art, literature, and the culture expansion of his hometown of Harlem for inspiration for the novel, despite all of the day to day war media.  He applied the previous African American Great Migration to his character backgrounds and to allow for contrasting views.\nJames Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain also reflects elements of African-American folklore, similar to the ones found in West Africa. Things like sermons, music, and spirituality in the novel took inspiration from African-American culture, but also the Wolof ethnic group of West Africa. This parallel is seen as a interpretation to Baldwin's relationship with Africa.\nGo Tell It on the Mountain is structured in a nonlinear structure. The novel is in a narrative voice that shifts between characters perspectives. Scenes also tend to veer off into reveries. The novel is broken down into: \"Part One: The Seventh Day,\" \"Part Two: The Prayer of the Saints-Florence's Prayer,\" \"Part Two: The Prayer of the Saints-Gabriel's Prayer,\" \"Part two: The Prayer of the Saints-Elizabeth's Prayer,\" and, finally, \"Part Three: The Threshing-Floor\".\nThe Novel: The ambiguity of the title was intentional on Baldwin's part. He wanted it to symbolize the unity of The Old Testament and New Testament. The cry of \"Go Tell it on the Mountain\" is much more than the mere announcement of good news; it is a shout of faith. But with this faith, struggle and suffering is still present. Through the novel, the title becomes symbolic of the specific human situation when a costly break with the past has been made and a new road, beset with dangers but promising salvation, has been undertaken.\nBible References: Go Tell It on the Mountain is a novel with a lot of hidden symbolism, specifically religious symbolism. There have been many misconceptions about the novel because of Baldwin's use of Biblical allusion for symbolic expression.\nMusic: To start, the title \"Go Tell It\" has an African American religious reference. It refers to the good news, or gospel that Jesus Christ is born, or the message of Moses to the People. Music plays a very big part in John's release as well at the Threshing Floor. He is able to build off of the music to reach his God-given revelation.\nJohn's journey to manhood:This is a symbolization of the psychological step from dependence to a sense of self. Up to a certain point in John's life, he relies on the Pentecostal church for guidance. However, as he gets older, he realizes some things about himself, for example his homosexuality, and begins to go on a spiritual pilgrimage to figure himself out.\nCentral Park: Baldwin calls this location John's \"favorite hill\". The hill at central park relates to John's journey as he is force his way out of his current state of poverty and \"anger\". This park represents a safe space outside the pressures of his home and the church. This is the first time within the novel that John feels powerful and confident. He wants to cry out a upon reaching the top of the hill. The hill represents the stark journey that he must press himself out of to get to that place of a chance for spiritual freedom. However, he soon realizes that this hill is not his only obstacle. He must now face the opposing racist forces in the better part of the city. Also, Central Park is the representation of a Mountain within New York City. It is a place where John can look at his past and future.\nThe Seventh Day: The seventh day is known for the day the Lord rests after he created the heavens and the earth. In the section of the book, after John cleans the house he is able to go about his day with leisure. It also relates to the first part of the bible because"

Written pseudonymously by \"A Square\", the book used the fictional two-dimensional world of Flatland to comment on the hierarchy of Victorian culture, but the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions. Several films have been made from the story, including the feature film Flatland (2007). Other efforts have been short or experimental films, including one narrated by Dudley Moore and the short films Flatland: The Movie (2007) and Flatland 2: Sphereland (2012).",

The story describes a two-dimensional world occupied by geometric figures, whereof women are simple line-segments, while men are polygons with various numbers of sides. The narrator is a square, a member of the caste of gentlemen and professionals, who guides the readers through some of the implications of life in two dimensions. The first half of the story goes through the practicalities of existing in a two-dimensional universe as well as a history leading up to the year 1999 on the eve of the 3rd Millennium.\nOn New Year's Eve, the Square dreams about a visit to a one-dimensional world (Lineland) inhabited by \"lustrous points\". These points are unable to see the Square as anything other than a set of points on a line. Thus, the Square attempts to convince the realm's monarch of a second dimension, but is unable to do so. In the end, the monarch of Lineland tries to kill A Square rather than tolerate his nonsense any further.\nFollowing this vision, he is himself visited by a three-dimensional sphere. Similar to the \"points\" in Lineland, the Square is unable to see the sphere as anything other than a  circle. The Sphere then levitates up and down through the Flatland, allowing Square to see the circle expand and contract. The Square is not fully convinced until he sees Spaceland (a tridimensional world) for himself. This Sphere visits Flatland at the turn of each millennium to introduce a new apostle to the idea of a third dimension in the hope of eventually educating the population of Flatland. From the safety of Spaceland, they are able to observe the leaders of Flatland secretly acknowledging the existence of the sphere and prescribing the silencing on. After this proclamation is made, many witnesses are massacred or imprisoned (according to caste), including the Square's brother.\nAfter the Square's mind is opened to new dimensions, he tries to convince the Sphere of the theoretical possibility of the existence of a fourth and higher spatial dimensions, but the Sphere returns his student to Flatland in disgrace.\nThe Square then has a dream in which the Sphere visits him again, this time to introduce him to Pointland, whereof the point (sole inhabitant, monarch, and universe in one) perceives any communication as a thought originating in his own mind (cf. Solipsism):\n\"You see,\" said my Teacher, \"how little your words have done. So far as the Monarch understands them at all, he accepts them as his own\u00a0\u2013 for he cannot conceive of any other except himself\u00a0\u2013 and plumes himself upon the variety of Its Thought as an instance of creative Power. Let us leave this god of Pointland to the ignorant fruition of his omnipresence and omniscience: nothing that you or I can do can rescue him from his self-satisfaction.\"\n\u2014\u2009the Sphere\nThe Square recognises the identity of the ignorance of the monarchs of Pointland and Lineland with his own (and the Sphere's) previous ignorance of the existence of higher dimensions. Once returned to Flatland, the Square cannot convince anyone of Spaceland's existence, especially after official decrees are announced that anyone preaching the existence of three dimensions will be imprisoned (or executed, depending on caste). Eventually the Square himself is imprisoned for just this reason, with only occasional contact with his brother who is imprisoned in the same facility. He does not manage to convince his brother, even after all they have both seen. Seven years after being imprisoned, A Square writes out the book Flatland in the form of a memoir, hoping to keep it as posterity for a future generation that can see beyond their two-dimensional existence.\nMen are portrayed as polygons whose social status is determined by their regularity and the number of their sides, with a Circle considered the \"perfect\" shape. On the other hand, women consist only of lines and are required by law to sound a \"peace-cry\" as they walk, lest they be mistaken face-to-face for a point. The Square gives accounts of cases where women have accidentally or deliberately stabbed men to death, as evidence of the need for separate doors for women and men in buildings.\nIn the world of Flatland, classes are distinguished by the \"Art of Hearing\", the \"Art of Feeling\", and the \"Art of Sight Recognition\". Classes can be distinguished by the sound of one's voice, but the lower classes have more developed vocal organs, enabling them to feign the voice of a Polygon or even a Circle. Feeling, practised by the lower classes and women, determines the configuration of a person by feeling one of its angles. The \"Art of Sight Recognition\","

While Evangeline encounters horrors at the hotel, she goes missing in the eyes of the world. Meanwhile, mysterious tapes are delivered to the offices of The Hours, infecting the entire audio system with a strange noise.\nEvangeline Harker: daughter of a Texan oil magnate, who works as an associate producer on The Hour and who is sent to Transylvania to scout a possible story on Ion Torgu.

Trouble on Triton: An Ambiguous Heterotopia (1976) is a science fiction novel by American writer Samuel R. Delany. It was nominated for the 1976 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and was shortlisted for a retrospective James Tiptree, Jr. Award in 1995. It was originally published under the shorter title Triton.\nDelany has said that Trouble on Triton was written partly in dialogue with Ursula K. Le Guin's anarchist science fiction novel The Dispossessed, whose subtitle was An Ambiguous Utopia. It is also loosely linked to other books by him (particularly Nevery\u00f3na) in its references to \"the modular calculus\", a vaguely described future mathematics that would analyze analogies, fictional constructs, and possibly human personalities. The most recent U.S. edition from Wesleyan University Press (1996) has a foreword by the postmodern novelist Kathy Acker, focusing on Trouble on Triton as Orphic fiction.\nAs the subtitle implies, the novel offers several conflicting perspectives on the concept of utopia. Utopia literally means \"good place\" or \"no place\". Delany takes the term heterotopia from the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault.  Literally, heterotopia means \"other place\" or \"a place of differences\". Foucault uses the term to designate spaces outside everyday fixed institutional and social spaces, for example trains, motels and cemeteries. In the novel's future solar system, Neptune's moon Triton supports one of several human societies independent from Earth, which has developed along radically libertarian lines in some ways: though a representative government exists, it has virtually no power to regulate private behavior, and citizens may choose to live in an area where no laws apply at all. Technology provides for a high degree of self-modification, so that one can change one's physical appearance, gender, sexual orientation, and even specific patterns of likes and dislikes.\nAlthough dissatisfied with the novel's \"abrupt\" conclusion, Richard A. Lupoff praised Triton as \"a thoroughly absorbing, highly rewarding reading experience. . . . a noble and fascinating experiment [that] speaks well for the author.\"\nThe novel offers a unique directional artificial gravitational field created by inducing relativistic motion of atomic particles, essentially extreme elliptical orbits.\nTrouble on Triton is not to be confused with the 1941 Henry Kuttner novel or the 1954 Alan E. Nourse novel Trouble on Titan.\nThe title of the novel was inspired by Leonard Bernstein's 1952 opera, Trouble in Tahiti. Fred Pohl, the editor at Bantam, made Delany shorten the title to Triton to avoid confusion.\nTrouble on Triton contains the first two parts of the five-part series \"Some Informal Remarks Toward the Modular Calculus\", which continues in several volumes of the Return to Nev\u00e8r\u00ffon series. The novel as a whole is Part One, while Part Two is the novel's second appendix.\nBron's home city of Bellona on Mars shares its name with the Bellona where Delany's other novel Dhalgren is set.\nSeveral plot elements in Trouble on Triton have similar corresponding elements in Delany's Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand.\nTrouble on Triton is set in the same universe as Delany's short story \"Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones\", included in his collection Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories.\nThe complex game vlet, which Bron observes the play of, is inspired by the Joanna Russ short story \"A Game of Vlet\", found in her collection The Zanzibar Cat.\nOn Triton and Other Matters: An Interview with Samuel R.

In the Alliance-Union universe, Tripoint is a system of three \"dark\" masses orbiting each other. They are not composed of dark matter; rather, they are much less luminous than a star. Two of the points are brown dwarfs, and the third may have been captured later. It was first charted and navigated in 2266, and serves as a staging jump-point on some of the commercial station-to-station hops, for example, Pell\u2013Viking and Pell\u2013Mariner. Tripoint's orbital behavior is troublesome to predict due to gravitational interactions of three massive bodies; thus, navigation is challenging in the vicinity.\nTwenty years in the past, merchanter ships Sprite and Corinthian were docked at Mariner Station. What started out as a friendly sleepover between the inexperienced Marie Hawkins of Sprite and Austin Bowe of Corinthian turned into rape, with Marie becoming pregnant. She elected to raise the child, Thomas Bowe-Hawkins, on Sprite, but was consumed with rage. Her brother becomes captain of the Sprite. Tom grew up with an ambivalent mother and was never fully accepted by his family. When Austin later became senior captain of Corinthian, Marie started tracking Corinthian's movements in order to expose what she suspected was smuggling.\nWhen the two ships cross paths again, this time at Viking, Marie is ready for her revenge. She and Tom scour the docks for information about Corinthian's cargo, but Tom is caught snooping and is imprisoned aboard Corinthian, forcing the ship to depart prematurely for Pell Station via Tripoint.  At Marie's insistence, Sprite pursues Corinthian. On Corinthian, Tom meets Austin, his domineering father, and Capella, second chief navigator and night-walker.\nWhen Corinthian docks at Pell Station, Tom's younger half-brother, Christian Bowe-Perrault tries to solve the problem by shipping him off to Sol Station, but Tom escapes and hides on the docks. Christian and Capella search frantically for him, unaware that Sabrina Perrault-Cadiz, Christian's cousin, has already found and befriended him. When Capella contacts old acquaintances for assistance, it attracts the unwanted attention of a dissident faction within the outlawed Mazianni Fleet. Capella is an ex-Fleet navigator with knowledge of Fleet routes and drop-points, which the dissidents want.\nWhen Corinthian prepares to depart for Tripoint, Tom returns voluntarily to the ship and is no longer treated as a prisoner. He learns the ship's secret: they are illegally trading with the renegade Fleet. Austin justifies this by maintaining that supplying the Fleet means it won't have to raid merchanter ships.\nSprite arrives at Pell Station shortly after Corinthian's departure and takes off again in pursuit. During Corinthian's jump to Tripoint, Capella is aware of Sprite and a Mazianni spotter following and performs a premature system-drop near an abandoned freighter, causing the other ships to overshoot. Corinthian immediately starts frantically offloading to the freighter, a Fleet drop-point. As the spotter and Sprite approach, Tom and Christian activate the freighter's weapons and destroy the spotter.\nTom tells his mother he is staying with Corinthian because he is more at home on his father's ship than his mother's. Marie, having taken the captaincy of Sprite from her weak brother, does not expose Corinthian's illegal trade because of Tom and because Corinthian outguns Sprite. Austin realizes too many people know about his connection with the Fleet and decides to leave Alliance-Union space for good. As amends for the past, Austin offers Marie the access codes to the hulk at Tripoint and the opportunity to take over Corinthian's profitable trade, but she declines and the ships part company.\nDuring Corinthian's next jump, Capella tells Tom about a new drop-point she discovered that leads to a habitable planet with forests. The Mazianni are building a new secret colony there and Corinthian is now part of that future.\nMerchanter ship Sprite\nThomas Bowe-Hawkins \u2013 junior computer technician\nMarie Hawkins \u2013 cargo chief, Thomas' mother\nMischa Hawkins \u2013 captain, Marie's brother\nMerchanter ship Corinthian\nChristian Bowe-Perrault \u2013 officer, Thomas' half-brother\nAustin Bowe \u2013 captain, Thomas and Christian's father\nBeatrice Perrault \u2013 pilot, Christian's mother\nSabrina Perrault-Cadiz \u2013 officer, Christian's cousin\nCapella \u2013 second chief navigator on loan to Corinthian from the Fleet\nAlliance-Union universe\nJump (Alliance-Union universe)\nCherryh, C.

The society of Mars is far harsher than that of Triton, and it has evidently influenced Bron's personality. He is self-absorbed, often lacks insight about himself and others, and has great difficulty with personal relationships. Though the civilization of Triton offers everything that he could reasonably want, he is unhappy with his life, out of harmony with those around him, and continually looking for others to blame whenever things go wrong. As the novel continues, political tensions between Triton and Earth lead to a destructive interplanetary war. ...",

Trouble on Triton: An Ambiguous Heterotopia (1976) is a science fiction novel by American writer Samuel R. Delany. It was nominated for the 1976 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and was shortlisted for a retrospective James Tiptree, Jr. Award in 1995. It was originally published under the shorter title Triton.\nDelany has said that Trouble on Triton was written partly in dialogue with Ursula K. Le Guin's anarchist science fiction novel The Dispossessed, whose subtitle was An Ambiguous Utopia. It is also loosely linked to other books by him (particularly Nevery\u00f3na) in its references to \"the modular calculus\", a vaguely described future mathematics that would analyze analogies, fictional constructs, and possibly human personalities. The most recent U.S. edition from Wesleyan University Press (1996) has a foreword by the postmodern novelist Kathy Acker, focusing on Trouble on Triton as Orphic fiction.\nAs the subtitle implies, the novel offers several conflicting perspectives on the concept of utopia. Utopia literally means \"good place\" or \"no place\". Delany takes the term heterotopia from the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault.  Literally, heterotopia means \"other place\" or \"a place of differences\". Foucault uses the term to designate spaces outside everyday fixed institutional and social spaces, for example trains, motels and cemeteries. In the novel's future solar system, Neptune's moon Triton supports one of several human societies independent from Earth, which has developed along radically libertarian lines in some ways: though a representative government exists, it has virtually no power to regulate private behavior, and citizens may choose to live in an area where no laws apply at all. Technology provides for a high degree of self-modification, so that one can change one's physical appearance, gender, sexual orientation, and even specific patterns of likes and dislikes.\nAlthough dissatisfied with the novel's \"abrupt\" conclusion, Richard A. Lupoff praised Triton as \"a thoroughly absorbing, highly rewarding reading experience. . . . a noble and fascinating experiment [that] speaks well for the author.\"\nThe novel offers a unique directional artificial gravitational field created by inducing relativistic motion of atomic particles, essentially extreme elliptical orbits.\nTrouble on Triton is not to be confused with the 1941 Henry Kuttner novel or the 1954 Alan E. Nourse novel Trouble on Titan.\nThe title of the novel was inspired by Leonard Bernstein's 1952 opera, Trouble in Tahiti. Fred Pohl, the editor at Bantam, made Delany shorten the title to Triton to avoid confusion.\nTrouble on Triton contains the first two parts of the five-part series \"Some Informal Remarks Toward the Modular Calculus\", which continues in several volumes of the Return to Nev\u00e8r\u00ffon series. The novel as a whole is Part One, while Part Two is the novel's second appendix.\nBron's home city of Bellona on Mars shares its name with the Bellona where Delany's other novel Dhalgren is set.\nSeveral plot elements in Trouble on Triton have similar corresponding elements in Delany's Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand.\nTrouble on Triton is set in the same universe as Delany's short story \"Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones\", included in his collection Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories.\nThe complex game vlet, which Bron observes the play of, is inspired by the Joanna Russ short story \"A Game of Vlet\", found in her collection The Zanzibar Cat.\nOn Triton and Other Matters: An Interview with Samuel R.

Prague is a historical novel by Arthur Phillips about a group of North American expatriates in Budapest, Hungary. It is set in about 1990, at the end of the Cold War. Prague is the author's debut novel, first published by Random House in 2002. In 2003, it won The Los Angeles Times/Art Seidenbaum Award for Best First Fiction.\nJohn Price is the protagonist of the novel, a 24-year-old who comes to Budapest to find his brother, with whom he has had a strained relationship. A dreamer throughout the story, he constantly suspects that life is better, more authentic, somewhere else. Both John and Scott Price are Jewish and from the US West Coast.\nScott Price maintains a grudge against his younger brother John. A jock alpha male with a decidedly un-alpha childhood (he was overweight and often picked upon), he experiences regular lapses of insecurity, blaming John for his unpleasant childhood. For a living, he teaches English. Ultimately, he leaves for Romania with his wife, M\u00e1ria, to escape John.\nEmily Oliver is an embassy worker, originally from Nebraska. The details of her work are not known to the other characters (she works in a classified information environment). She often feels unfulfilled by her work and suspects that she is living in the shadow of her father, with a distinguished foreign service career.\nMark Payton is a gay Canadian academic who researches nostalgia. As his time in Budapest progresses, he becomes unable to separate his life from his work (which the other characters view as charmingly irrelevant) and eventually leaves for mental health reasons.\nCharles (K\u00e1roly) G\u00e1bor is a junior member of a risk-averse venture capital firm. Of Hungarian ancestry (his parents escaped during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution) he came to Budapest hoping to earn a fortune, but his lethargic firm refuses his proposals. Eventually, he grows bitter, suspecting that all of Hungary's entrepreneurial spirits have been drained by four decades of Communism. He independently gathers investment capital to restart the Horv\u00e1th Press.\nKaren Whitley is John Price's officemate, described by Nicky M. as \"the office airhead\", and the woman to whom John Price loses his virginity.\nNicky Mankiewiliczki-Pobudziej (aka Nicky M.) is John Price's artist girlfriend who, while affectionate toward him, is also inerrantly selfish. While allowing sexual relations to flow freely, she refuses to give him any emotional support. She also has an affair with Emily Oliver.\nM\u00e1ria is Scott Price's fianc\u00e9e and, later, wife, of Hungarian ancestry. Despite her evident affection for Scott, she sleeps with John at one point in the novel.\nN\u00e1dja is an elderly Hungarian piano player. A cosmopolite with dazzling stories, she becomes a close friend of John throughout the novel, and he even experiences a sexual attraction to her, wishing she were younger so that he could be featured in her romantic stories. Of the characters who meet her, only John actually believes her unlikely stories, but the question of their veracity is never settled.\nImre Horv\u00e1th is the head of a Hungarian publishing house that has been in his family for six generations. He escaped Hungary in 1956 and began a new publishing house in Vienna. After the fall of Communism, he wishes to return home and restart the press. Other characters see him as a silly, self-important old man.\nKrisztina Toldy is Mr. Horv\u00e1th's devoted assistant.\nPrague is set in Budapest, Hungary, following the Cold War.  The city of Prague represents the unfulfilled emotional desires of the novel's main characters: it is the city where \u2013 as the novel's characters perceive \u2013 there is more life, capital flows more freely, and there are better parties.\nThe five central expatriates are reminiscent of the Lost Generation popularized in novels such as Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. Each of Prague's main characters comes to the city with a different motive. For Mark Payton, Budapest is an opportunity for field research in his study of historical nostalgia; he views his native city of Toronto as bland and lacking history. Emily desires to emulate her father's acclaimed foreign service career by working in the United States embassy. Scott Price seeks to escape his miserable childhood in the United States, while John Price (whom Scott sees as a source of said misery) desires reconciliation. Finally, Charles G\u00e1bor's goal is to make a fortune as a venture capitalist in the emerging, new Budapest.\nHungarian history is prominently featured in Prague, emerging via the novel's major Hungarian characters, particularly N\u00e1dja. About one quarter of the novel deals exclusively with"

In the Alliance-Union universe, Tripoint is a system of three \"dark\" masses orbiting each other. They are not composed of dark matter; rather, they are much less luminous than a star. Two of the points are brown dwarfs, and the third may have been captured later. It was first charted and navigated in 2266, and serves as a staging jump-point on some of the commercial station-to-station hops, for example, Pell\u2013Viking and Pell\u2013Mariner. Tripoint's orbital behavior is troublesome to predict due to gravitational interactions of three massive bodies; thus, navigation is challenging in the vicinity.\nTwenty years in the past, merchanter ships Sprite and Corinthian were docked at Mariner Station. What started out as a friendly sleepover between the inexperienced Marie Hawkins of Sprite and Austin Bowe of Corinthian turned into rape, with Marie becoming pregnant. She elected to raise the child, Thomas Bowe-Hawkins, on Sprite, but was consumed with rage. Her brother becomes captain of the Sprite. Tom grew up with an ambivalent mother and was never fully accepted by his family. When Austin later became senior captain of Corinthian, Marie started tracking Corinthian's movements in order to expose what she suspected was smuggling.\nWhen the two ships cross paths again, this time at Viking, Marie is ready for her revenge. She and Tom scour the docks for information about Corinthian's cargo, but Tom is caught snooping and is imprisoned aboard Corinthian, forcing the ship to depart prematurely for Pell Station via Tripoint.  At Marie's insistence, Sprite pursues Corinthian. On Corinthian, Tom meets Austin, his domineering father, and Capella, second chief navigator and night-walker.\nWhen Corinthian docks at Pell Station, Tom's younger half-brother, Christian Bowe-Perrault tries to solve the problem by shipping him off to Sol Station, but Tom escapes and hides on the docks. Christian and Capella search frantically for him, unaware that Sabrina Perrault-Cadiz, Christian's cousin, has already found and befriended him. When Capella contacts old acquaintances for assistance, it attracts the unwanted attention of a dissident faction within the outlawed Mazianni Fleet. Capella is an ex-Fleet navigator with knowledge of Fleet routes and drop-points, which the dissidents want.\nWhen Corinthian prepares to depart for Tripoint, Tom returns voluntarily to the ship and is no longer treated as a prisoner. He learns the ship's secret: they are illegally trading with the renegade Fleet. Austin justifies this by maintaining that supplying the Fleet means it won't have to raid merchanter ships.\nSprite arrives at Pell Station shortly after Corinthian's departure and takes off again in pursuit. During Corinthian's jump to Tripoint, Capella is aware of Sprite and a Mazianni spotter following and performs a premature system-drop near an abandoned freighter, causing the other ships to overshoot. Corinthian immediately starts frantically offloading to the freighter, a Fleet drop-point. As the spotter and Sprite approach, Tom and Christian activate the freighter's weapons and destroy the spotter.\nTom tells his mother he is staying with Corinthian because he is more at home on his father's ship than his mother's. Marie, having taken the captaincy of Sprite from her weak brother, does not expose Corinthian's illegal trade because of Tom and because Corinthian outguns Sprite. Austin realizes too many people know about his connection with the Fleet and decides to leave Alliance-Union space for good. As amends for the past, Austin offers Marie the access codes to the hulk at Tripoint and the opportunity to take over Corinthian's profitable trade, but she declines and the ships part company.\nDuring Corinthian's next jump, Capella tells Tom about a new drop-point she discovered that leads to a habitable planet with forests.

The prologue describes Victor Truman \"Hook\" Hobie's carefully planned escape route in the event of somebody discovering his \"really big, well-guarded secret\". His \"early-warning system\" consists of geographically-located \"tripwires\" that will warn him that he has been discovered. The first is eleven thousand miles from his home in the United States and the second is six thousand miles out. His response to their activation would be to tie up loose ends, cash in, transfer his assets, and flee the country. Over thirty years of quiet success have made him feel somewhat secure. But he did not expect both alerts to arrive on the same day.\nThe story then begins with Jack Reacher working two jobs in Key West (digging pools with a shovel by day and working in a bar at night) and bumping into a private investigator, Costello, who happens to be looking for him on behalf of a client named Mrs. Jacob, a name Reacher does not recognise. Later on, while Reacher is working his night job as a bouncer in a strip club, two suspicious-looking large men also make inquiries about his location. Reacher attempts to follow them but instead finds Costello murdered on the sidewalk. Jack then flies to New York to find out why Costello was looking for him and why he was killed for it.\nAfter finding Costello's office seemingly untouched, Reacher's suspicion is aroused by an unsaved document open on the secretary's computer. Searching through the files on the computer Reacher gets the contact information for Mrs. Jacob and arrives in the middle of a funeral for his old mentor, former commanding officer, and friend, Col. Leon Garber. Garber's now-adult daughter, Jodie Garber-Jacob, turns out to be the mystery client. She has become a successful lawyer.\nReacher and Jodie follow Costello's trail, uncovering information on her father's last project, an investigation for the Hobie family on the whereabouts of their son Victor, a helicopter pilot reported missing-in-action decades ago in Vietnam. They discover that the Hobies had been tricked into giving their life savings to a con man and gun runner named Rutter, who poses as a fake military liaison and investigator to families of MIA soldiers. Hobie becomes aware of their investigation, and tries to hunt them down. After forcing Rutter to return the money he stole, Reacher and Jodie visit the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, which leads them to the military Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii, a special facility that identifies the forensic remains of soldiers. \nThey then learn that Hobie served in the war as a helicopter pilot until he was shot down. However, it becomes clear that Hobie died in the crash, and that another soldier named Carl Allen assumed his identity in order to escape prosecution for fragging a superior officer. Severely burned by the crash, Allen left his own dogtags behind to fool investigators and had his right hand, lost in the helicopter crash, replaced with a hook.\nUnder his new identity, Allen amasses a fortune as an illicit \"moneylender\", before establishing himself as a legitimate businessman who offers high-interest loans to financially troubled firms unable to borrow from banks. However, his real objective is to seize control of their assets, using threats and torture to force his clients to agree to his terms. Despite being aware that Reacher's investigation could expose his crimes, Allen decides to complete one final job: the takeover of a bankrupt multimillion-dollar company owned by Chester and Marilyn Stone. Allen and his men take the couple hostage, but Marilyn is able to stall them before her husband signs over his company.\nJodie is called back to New York by her law firm to handle the Stone deal, but ends up being captured  by Allen along with another private investigator posing as the Stone's lawyer, forcing Reacher to come to her rescue. Reacher manages to kill Allen and his men, but sustains a seemingly fatal bullet wound to his chest. At the hospital, however, a doctor discovers that, due to the arduous physical labour he has done digging pools in Key West, his pectoral muscle was so thick the bullet did not make it past his rib cage. Reacher is then visited (while convalescing) by the Hobie family to thank him for restoring their son's good name.\nThe bullet wound that Reacher received is mentioned a few times in other Lee Child novels.\nMost of the women that Reacher sleeps with notice the \"crater\" and usually place their pinkie there while asking how it happened. \nIn One Shot Reacher sums up the"

His \"early-warning system\" consists of geographically-located \"tripwires\" that will warn him that he has been discovered. The first is eleven thousand miles from his home in the United States and the second is six thousand miles out. His response to their activation would be to tie up loose ends, cash in, transfer his assets, and flee the country. Over thirty years of quiet success have made him feel somewhat secure.

Tripwire is the third book in the Jack Reacher series written by Lee Child. It was published in 1999 by Putnam in America and Bantam in the United Kingdom. It is written in the third person. In the novel, retired military police officer Jack Reacher becomes embroiled in a mystery involving a Vietnam War veteran who was reported missing in action, but who has resurfaced as a vicious loanshark with a secret he will murder to protect.\nThe bullet wound that Reacher received is mentioned a few times in other Lee Child novels.\nMost of the women that Reacher sleeps with notice the \"crater\" and usually place their pinkie there while asking how it happened. \nIn One Shot Reacher sums up the story by saying it was a wound received by a \"Mad Man\" and that most women are curious about it except for the one whom he was saving at the time.\nLee Child began writing Tripwire in spring 1997. The book was published on 15 June 1999 in the United Kingdom and the American publication followed on 28 June of the same year.\nThe reasoning for the opening of the book taking place in Key West was a vacation Child spent there in 1996.\nThe provisional title for Tripwire was The Hook, but that name was scrapped as Putnam believed the title was not \"punchy\" enough. Putnam also believed The Hook would remind people too much of Peter Pan.\nTripwire received positive reviews from critics, with The Orlando Sentinel calling it \"a thriller good to the last drop\" and The Arizona Daily Star saying \"Lee Child can write. [...] Child grabs hold with the first page and won't let go until the finish. This is pulse-pounding suspense, and Child hardly misses a beat.\" The book was also praised by fellow authors, with Michael Connelly saying \"It's a tightly-drawn and swift thriller that gives new meaning to what a page-turner should be.\" Stephen White also commented, calling Tripwire a \"stylish thriller.\"\n\"UK Tripwire information page on Fantastic Fiction\".

Tripoint is a science fiction novel  by the United States science fiction and fantasy author C. J. Cherryh,  first published by Warner Books in September 1994. It is one of Cherryh's Merchanter novels and is set in the author's Alliance-Union universe.\nIn the Alliance-Union universe, Tripoint is a system of three \"dark\" masses orbiting each other. They are not composed of dark matter; rather, they are much less luminous than a star. Two of the points are brown dwarfs, and the third may have been captured later. It was first charted and navigated in 2266, and serves as a staging jump-point on some of the commercial station-to-station hops, for example, Pell\u2013Viking and Pell\u2013Mariner. Tripoint's orbital behavior is troublesome to predict due to gravitational interactions of three massive bodies; thus, navigation is challenging in the vicinity.\nMerchanter ship Sprite\nThomas Bowe-Hawkins \u2013 junior computer technician\nMarie Hawkins \u2013 cargo chief, Thomas' mother\nMischa Hawkins \u2013 captain, Marie's brother\nMerchanter ship Corinthian\nChristian Bowe-Perrault \u2013 officer, Thomas' half-brother\nAustin Bowe \u2013 captain, Thomas and Christian's father\nBeatrice Perrault \u2013 pilot, Christian's mother\nSabrina Perrault-Cadiz \u2013 officer, Christian's cousin\nCapella \u2013 second chief navigator on loan to Corinthian from the Fleet\nAlliance-Union universe\nJump (Alliance-Union universe)\nCherryh, C.

Prague is a historical novel by Arthur Phillips about a group of North American expatriates in Budapest, Hungary. It is set in about 1990, at the end of the Cold War. Prague is the author's debut novel, first published by Random House in 2002. In 2003, it won The Los Angeles Times/Art Seidenbaum Award for Best First Fiction.\nJohn Price is the protagonist of the novel, a 24-year-old who comes to Budapest to find his brother, with whom he has had a strained relationship. A dreamer throughout the story, he constantly suspects that life is better, more authentic, somewhere else. Both John and Scott Price are Jewish and from the US West Coast.\nScott Price maintains a grudge against his younger brother John. A jock alpha male with a decidedly un-alpha childhood (he was overweight and often picked upon), he experiences regular lapses of insecurity, blaming John for his unpleasant childhood. For a living, he teaches English. Ultimately, he leaves for Romania with his wife, M\u00e1ria, to escape John.\nEmily Oliver is an embassy worker, originally from Nebraska. The details of her work are not known to the other characters (she works in a classified information environment). She often feels unfulfilled by her work and suspects that she is living in the shadow of her father, with a distinguished foreign service career.\nMark Payton is a gay Canadian academic who researches nostalgia. As his time in Budapest progresses, he becomes unable to separate his life from his work (which the other characters view as charmingly irrelevant) and eventually leaves for mental health reasons.\nCharles (K\u00e1roly) G\u00e1bor is a junior member of a risk-averse venture capital firm. Of Hungarian ancestry (his parents escaped during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution) he came to Budapest hoping to earn a fortune, but his lethargic firm refuses his proposals. Eventually, he grows bitter, suspecting that all of Hungary's entrepreneurial spirits have been drained by four decades of Communism. He independently gathers investment capital to restart the Horv\u00e1th Press.\nKaren Whitley is John Price's officemate, described by Nicky M. as \"the office airhead\", and the woman to whom John Price loses his virginity.\nNicky Mankiewiliczki-Pobudziej (aka Nicky M.) is John Price's artist girlfriend who, while affectionate toward him, is also inerrantly selfish. While allowing sexual relations to flow freely, she refuses to give him any emotional support. She also has an affair with Emily Oliver.\nM\u00e1ria is Scott Price's fianc\u00e9e and, later, wife, of Hungarian ancestry. Despite her evident affection for Scott, she sleeps with John at one point in the novel.\nN\u00e1dja is an elderly Hungarian piano player. A cosmopolite with dazzling stories, she becomes a close friend of John throughout the novel, and he even experiences a sexual attraction to her, wishing she were younger so that he could be featured in her romantic stories. Of the characters who meet her, only John actually believes her unlikely stories, but the question of their veracity is never settled.\nImre Horv\u00e1th is the head of a Hungarian publishing house that has been in his family for six generations. He escaped Hungary in 1956 and began a new publishing house in Vienna. After the fall of Communism, he wishes to return home and restart the press. Other characters see him as a silly, self-important old man.\nKrisztina Toldy is Mr. Horv\u00e1th's devoted assistant.\nPrague is set in Budapest, Hungary, following the Cold War.  The city of Prague represents the unfulfilled emotional desires of the novel's main characters: it is the city where \u2013 as the novel's characters perceive \u2013 there is more life, capital flows more freely, and there are better parties.\nThe five central expatriates are reminiscent of the Lost Generation popularized in novels such as Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. Each of Prague's main characters comes to the city with a different motive. For Mark Payton, Budapest is an opportunity for field research in his study of historical nostalgia; he views his native city of Toronto as bland and lacking history. Emily desires to emulate her father's acclaimed foreign service career by working in the United States embassy. Scott Price seeks to escape his miserable childhood in the United States, while John Price (whom Scott sees as a source of said misery) desires reconciliation. Finally, Charles G\u00e1bor's goal is to make a fortune as a venture capitalist in the emerging, new Budapest.\nHungarian history is prominently featured in Prague, emerging via the novel's major Hungarian characters, particularly N\u00e1dja.

Cradle is a 1988 science fiction novel by Arthur\u00a0C. Clarke and Gentry Lee. The major premise of Cradle is contact between a few humans from the Miami area in 1994 and the super robots of a damaged space ship submerged off the Florida coast. Telecommunication advances such as videotelephones and highly efficient underwater scanning equipment used in the story bridge from the everyday, real-life aspects of the setting toward the near future, bespeaking technological progress.\nThe book has been criticized for excessive descriptions of the characters' personal lives unrelated to the plot and its numerous sex scenes. In one critic's words:\n\"I\u2019m all for character development and, if it\u2019s pertinent to future events, I don\u2019t really mind if it drags a little. But the first few hundred pages of Cradle are filled with more-or-less pointless character development, clearly written by Lee, that would be perfectly at home in a Harlequin romance novel. A few pages of sci-fi, clearly not written by Lee, are interspersed so that the reader may be reminded that they paid $6 for a Clarke novel and not $2 for a grocery store romance tome.\"\nBrown, Charles N.; William G.

Jamie is carried to a nearby farmhouse where 18 Highland soldiers have sought refuge after the battle of Culloden. Harold Grey, Earl of Melton, arrives as representative of the Duke of Cumberland and announces the survivors will be shot. As each man is led outside to be executed, Melton takes his name for the records. At Jamie's turn, Melton recognizes him as famed Jacobite \u201cRed Jamie\u201d, but is forbidden to execute him because Jamie spared his younger brother, Lord John Grey, during the Battle of Prestonpans, and he sends Jamie home to die of his wounds.\nWhen the English scour the country for Jacobite rebels, Jamie hides in a cave near Lallybroch. He visits his sister, Jenny, and her family once a month to shave, wash, and hear news. By invoking a deed of sasine, Jamie signs Lallybroch over to Jenny\u2019s eldest son, also called Jamie, to prevent the English from seizing their home as the property of a traitor. For a brown wool cap he wears to cover his distinctive red hair, Jamie becomes a Scottish legend, the \u201cDunbonnet\u201d, and arranges to have  himself be captured, whereby his tenants claim the reward and prevent famine among themselves. At Ardsmuir Prison, Jamie becomes the leader of the prisoners under the nickname \"Mac Dubh\". At Ardsmuir, Jamie meets Lord John Grey again as the new governor of the prison. Lord John's predecessor tells him that he invited Jamie to dinner once a week to discuss the other prisoners and suggests that Lord John continue the custom, which he does. John believes that Jamie knows the whereabouts of the French gold allegedly sent to Bonnie Prince Charlie. When the prison is fully renovated, the Crown transports the prisoners to America and uses the former prison as an army barracks; but John has Jamie sent to Helwater in the Lake District, the stud farm of Lord Dunsany, as a groom.\nDunsany has two daughters; the elder, Geneva, is infatuated with Jamie but is betrothed to Lord Ellesmere, an elderly man, and she blackmails Jamie into sexual relations with her. Geneva leaves Helwater and marries Lord Ellesmere. Nine months later, she gives birth to a boy and dies the next day. Ellesmere tells Lord Dunsany that the baby is not his, and threatens to kill him; but Jamie kills Ellesmere instead. The baby, called William, returns to Helwater with them. In reward for his actions, Lady Dunsany offers to ask Lord John to petition for a pardon so he can go home to Lallybroch. However, Jamie stays several more years at Helwater, until Willie's resemblance to himself becomes evident, whereupon he accepts the pardon.\nIn the 20th century, Reverend Wakefield\u2019s adopted son, Roger MacKenzie, offers to determine Jamie's fate. When Roger, Claire, and Claire and Jamie's daughter Brianna find evidence of Jamie writing an article printed in 1765, Claire considers returning to him, and Brianna supports her. On Halloween of 1968, Claire returns to Jamie's time.\nClaire finds Jamie in Edinburgh under the name of Alexander Malcolm, smuggling liquor in the guise of a printers' shop. His nephew, Young Ian, runs away from Lallybroch to \u201cassist\u201d his uncle in the business. Claire is reunited with her unofficial adopted son, Fergus, whom she last knew as a 10-year-old French pickpocket, is now in his 30s. To explain her absence, the family tells everyone that Claire was with relatives in France, believing that Jamie was killed at Culloden, and only just learned that he was alive.\nAfter a failed smuggling run, Jamie takes Claire and Young Ian to Lallybroch, where Claire discovers that Jamie married again and has two stepdaughters, Marsali and Joan, and that Jamie's wife is Laoghaire, who, 20 years earlier, had Claire arrested and nearly burned her at the stake for witchcraft. Angry and betrayed, she leaves Lallybroch, but Young Ian brings her back, telling her that Laoghaire has shot Jamie. Upon return, Claire sees that the wound is infected and saves Jamie with antibiotics and syringes brought from the 20th century. Jamie negotiates a settlement with Laoghaire, to pay her 1,435 pounds in compensation, and to support her until she marries again. To get the money, he, Claire, and Young Ian return to the \u201cseals\u2019 treasure\u201d: the Jacobite gold and jewels buried on an island not far from Ardsmuir. When they have the treasure, they plan to go to France and sell the jewels, but Young Ian is kidnapped by a strange ship. Jamie and Claire go to France, where Jamie's cousin, Jared, helps them"

The book tells the story in flashbacks during the actual Mars mission of the chronicalised history until the mission's beginning. The point of divergence for this alternate timeline happens on 22 November 1963, where John F. Kennedy survived the assassination (Jacqueline Kennedy was killed, hence the renaming of the Kennedy Space Center as the Jacqueline B. Kennedy Space Center), but was crippled and thus incapacitated, as Lyndon B. Johnson is still sworn in. On 20 July 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Joe Muldoon walk on the Moon, and Nixon's \"most historic phone call\" is joined by a call from former President Kennedy, committing the United States to send a crewed mission to Mars, which Nixon backs as part of his fateful decision to decide the future of crewed spaceflight, instead of deciding on the Space Shuttle program as he did in our timeline.\nPreparations for this new goal include slashing the number of Moon landings so funding and leftover Apollo spacecraft hardware can go towards the efforts of the crewed Mars mission. Apollo 12 still lands, Apollo 13 still suffers its disaster, but Apollo 14 is crewed by the astronauts of the cancelled Apollo 15 mission to carry out the scientific experiments on the lunar surface, and is the last crewed Moon landing. At the same time, the NERVA program is revived to become the chosen Mars spacecraft development, with larger tests in Nevada, but without containment and plagued with engineering problems.\nThe book centres around chronicling the lives of the future Mars mission astronauts, NASA and contractor personnel all involved in making the mission become a reality, and the shifts within NASA's astronaut and management hierarchy throughout the mission's preparations, including female geologist Natalie York's quest to become an astronaut, and her stormy relationships with fellow astronaut Ben Priest and NERVA engineer Mike Conlig. Other astronauts include Ralph Gershon, a former fighter-bomber pilot involved in illegal bombing missions in Cambodia during the Vietnam War whose dream is to be the first black man in space, and Phil Stone, a veteran Air Force test pilot-turned-astronaut who has flown in a long-term stay on a lunar orbital station before the Mars mission.\nIn the 1970s, the Skylab Space Station is launched, but apparently as a wet workshop design that is based on the Saturn IB S-IVB upper stage called Skylab A. The Saturn V that might have launched Skylab in our timeline instead launches Skylab B, a lunar orbit space station unofficially named \"Moonlab\", also a wet workshop based on the S-IVB. The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project is instead a series of visits by the Apollo Command/Service Module to Salyut space stations, and Soyuz missions to both Skylab and Moonlab. To facilitate the latter, the Soviets finally finish work on their N-1. The Skylab/Moonlab programs lead to improvements in the design of the Apollo Command/Service Module. A Block III CSM is produced using battery power in place of fuel cells, followed by the Block IV and V, which have a degree of reusability (modular construction and resistance to salt water corrosion). Also chronicled is the development of the experimental 'Mars Excursion Module' by small aerospace firm Columbia Aviation as it struggles against larger rival contractors of NASA and its engineers working painstakingly against the technical challenges of a working and reliable Mars lander.\nA test of the NERVA, called Apollo-N, is finally launched atop the modified Saturn VN, but suffers from pogo oscillations in the S-IC first stage. This damages the NERVA upper stage, which catastrophically fails once fired in orbit; despite returning to Earth safely, the entire crew (including Ben Priest) is killed by radiation poisoning, and the space program nearly collapses from hostile political and public opinion against the use of nuclear power in space, and the seemingly unnecessary risks and reasons of a Mars mission.\nIn the aftermath, a new Mars mission plan dubbed Ares is drawn up, utilising the upgraded Saturn V-B, which has numerous improvements, including the use of solid rocket boosters to double its payload. Ares also uses on-orbit assembly of a different long duration Mars-ship using wet-workshop Saturn rocket components as the propulsion systems as well as a Skylab habitat module and external tanks to hold extra fuel.

Three young boys rob a minimart and the salesclerk is killed. Police chase the boys and they end up taking a family hostage. The house taken hostage was owned by Sonny Benza, a man who rules over the West Coast's most powerful Mafia empire. Sonny arranges for his men to kidnap the small town's police chief, Jeff Talley's, family. Talley goes to the location where his family is being held. A man named Marion Clewes executes Benza and his associates for their failure because Marion's employer in New York feels that Benza had betrayed the trust of Marion's employer by failing to retrieve two discs that would shut down Benza's organization and put Benza away for good. The police obtain one of the discs.

Cradle is a 1988 science fiction novel by Arthur\u00a0C. Clarke and Gentry Lee. The major premise of Cradle is contact between a few humans from the Miami area in 1994 and the super robots of a damaged space ship submerged off the Florida coast. Telecommunication advances such as videotelephones and highly efficient underwater scanning equipment used in the story bridge from the everyday, real-life aspects of the setting toward the near future, bespeaking technological progress.\nThe book has been criticized for excessive descriptions of the characters' personal lives unrelated to the plot and its numerous sex scenes. In one critic's words:\n\"I\u2019m all for character development and, if it\u2019s pertinent to future events, I don\u2019t really mind if it drags a little. But the first few hundred pages of Cradle are filled with more-or-less pointless character development, clearly written by Lee, that would be perfectly at home in a Harlequin romance novel. A few pages of sci-fi, clearly not written by Lee, are interspersed so that the reader may be reminded that they paid $6 for a Clarke novel and not $2 for a grocery store romance tome.\"\nBrown, Charles N.; William G.

It is set in 1356, nearly a decade after the original trilogy, and culminates with the Battle of Poitiers. Intertwined in the plot is the quest to find La Malice, a fabled sword of Saint Peter and Christian relic which may turn the tide of the long war for France.

His account of what happened in the field outside Poitiers is no exception. As always, Cornwell captures the essence of hand-to-hand combat \u2014 the stench, the confusion, the horrific brutality \u2014 with precision and immediacy. More than that, he imposes a degree of coherence on what must have been an utterly chaotic experience....The result is a lively, accessible account of a remote moment in European history, a book in which Cornwell\u2019s gifts as scholar and storyteller come together spectacularly.\nPublishers Weekly says no one describes a close hand-to-hand battle like Bernard Cornwell:\nCornwell, a master of action-packed historical fiction, returns with the fourth book in his Grail Quest series (after Heretic), a vivid, exciting portrayal of medieval warfare as the English and French butcher each other at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 during the Hundred Years War. Nobody writes battle scenes like Cornwell, accurately conveying the utter savagery of close combat with sword, ax, and mace, and the gruesome aftermath. English archer Sir Thomas of Hookton, called the Bastard by his enemies, leads a band of ruthless mercenaries in France. When the French hear of the existence of the sword of Saint Peter, \u201canother Excalibur,\u201d they must possess it for its legendary mystical powers, but the English have other ideas. Thomas is ordered by his lord, earl of Northampton, to find the sword first and begins, with his men, a perilous journey of raiding and plundering across southern France, fighting brutal warlords, cunning churchmen, with betrayal everywhere, and French and Scottish knights who vow to kill Thomas for reasons that have nothing to do with the sword. With surprising results, Thomas and his men reach the decisive Battle of Poitiers, a vicious melee that killed thousands, unseated a king,"

The Hegemony maintains an uneasy alliance with the TechnoCore, a civilisation of AIs. Modified humans known as Ousters live in space stations between stars and are engaged in conflict with the Hegemony.\nNumerous \"Outback\" planets have no farcasters and cannot be accessed without incurring significant time dilation. One of these planets is Hyperion, home to structures known as the Time Tombs, which are moving backwards in time and guarded by a legendary creature known as the Shrike. On the eve of an Ouster invasion of Hyperion, a final pilgrimage to the Time Tombs has been organized. The pilgrims decide that they will each tell their tale of how they were chosen for the pilgrimage.\nPaul Dur\u00e9 and Lenar Hoyt are Catholic priests. Dur\u00e9 is exiled to Hyperion. He researches an isolated civilization known as the Bikura. Dur\u00e9 deduces that the Bikura have been infected with cross-shaped parasites called cruciforms. After death, the cruciform rebuilds the physical body and resurrects them. Dur\u00e9 encounters the Shrike and is infected with a cruciform.\nSevere pain prevents Dur\u00e9 from either cutting out the cruciform or leaving the Bikura; his journal entries end. Hoyt reveals that Dur\u00e9 crucified himself to a tesla tree in a desperate attempt to rid himself of the cruciform. For seven years, Father Dur\u00e9 had been continually electrocuted and resurrected. As Hoyt touches Dur\u00e9, the cruciform falls from his body and allows him finally to die. The Bikura are destroyed with nuclear weapons, but not before Hoyt is infected with both Dur\u00e9's cruciform and one of his own.\nColonel Fedmahn Kassad's tale begins with a flashback to his days training in the FORCE military academy on Mars. During a simulation battle, a mysterious woman saves Kassad and becomes his lover.\nKassad hijacks an Ouster shuttle and crashes it onto Hyperion. There he is reunited with his lover Moneta. Kassad sees the Tree of Pain, a gigantic steel tree on which the Shrike impales its victims. Moneta and the Shrike teach him to use time-altering abilities in combat. Kassad realizes that Moneta and the Shrike have been manipulating him and wish to use him to spark an interstellar war in which billions of people will die. After Kassad is rescued, he becomes an anti-war activist.\nMartin Silenus trained as a poet, but his training was interrupted when a black hole destroyed Earth. Silenus is forced to work as a laborer. During this time, he starts work on his Hyperion Cantos, his magnum opus. His Dying Earth series becomes an enormous hit, making him a multi-millionaire.\nSilenus joins Sad King Billy on Hyperion. Billy is an aristocrat who decides to relocate to Hyperion and establish a kingdom of artists. Silenus resumes work on the Cantos and becomes convinced that the Shrike is his muse. Billy burns the Cantos manuscript and is taken away by the Shrike. In the centuries since, reliant on life-extending treatments, Silenus has been waiting to return to Hyperion to finish the poem.\nSol Weintraub, a Jewish professor, is present on the pilgrimage with his infant daughter Rachel. 20 years ago, Sol's adult daughter became an archaeologist and went to Hyperion. While mapping one of the Tombs, the Shrike appears; Rachel contracts a disease which causes her to age backwards. Sol wrestles for years with dreams in which he is ordered to go to Hyperion and sacrifice Rachel in a replay of the Binding of Isaac. He decides to become a pilgrim and to implore the Shrike for a cure. \nAfter hearing Weintraub's tale, the party retires outside to gaze at the stars. There, they see the Templar treeship which carried them to Hyperion destroyed by Ousters. The ship's captain (who is also on the pilgrimage), Het Masteen, does not react and retires to his room without speaking. In the morning, Masteen is missing and his room is found full of blood, despite a watch that has been kept all night.\nBrawne Lamia is a private investigator.

After a brief meeting between the High Priest Auron Tenebrae, Cleric Vandameer Craven, and Solomon Wreath, it was decided that Valkyrie would be considered as The Death Bringer within the Necromancer community, however, further proof would be needed to be acquired. Wreath was given the task to use the previously captured Remnant to make it inhabit Finbar Wrong\u2019s body to read the future regarding Valkyrie.\nMeanwhile, Skulduggery and Valkyrie were searching after Davina Marr, whom they held responsible for the destruction of the Irish Sanctuary. During their investigation, they realised that they were not the only ones looking for her. Shortly after they realised this, they encountered Tesseract, a highly skilled Russian assassin who was in the middle of a deadly chase after Marr. They were able to rescue her from him. Instead of giving her up to the authorities, they took her to Kenspeckle Grouse, as Skulduggery wanted to question her beforehand. While they had to give time to Kenspeckle to fix her, Valkyrie decided to visit the Echo Stone Gordon Edgley, as her uncertainty about her frightening future grew to drastic measures. After a long discussion with Gordon, he advised her to visit a Banshee, in order to gain information about how to seal her True Name.\nSolomon Wreath captured Finbar in order to force the Remnant into him and receive the information he wanted. While he could gather the information he thought to be valuable for the Necromancer community, the Remnant realised the importance of Valkyrie becoming Darquesse and thus providing a purpose for it to gather the others and gain control over her. Now fuelled with its purpose, the Remnant broke away from Wreath and escaped in search for Anton Shudder's Midnight Hotel.\nWhile Valkyrie is highly in doubt about her true nature as the destroyer of the world, she visits Caelan in order to ask him to taste her blood. If he did, it would mean he could tell Valkyrie what Dusk tasted or if there was anything \"Special\" about it. At first, Caelan refuses to help, stating he would: 'Tear her throat out'. He gives Valkyrie a penknife, instructing to cut herself and give him a small amount of blood. Once tasted, Caelan pretends to lose control, pushing her back against a tree. Instead of biting Valkyrie, he kisses her.\nThe Zombie King Vaurien Scapegrace was on the verge of falling apart, he was restlessly searching for a cure, which would help him to treat the downside of being a zombie. As he searches in vain, he acquires the location of Skulduggery's house, and takes his information to Roarhaven, where he was to sell it to the one who offers the information he needed. Among the auctioneers were Lightning Dave, Hokum Pete, Brobding, Hieronymus Deadfall, and unknown to them, Tesseract. While the former were keen to get the location, Tesseract eliminated each of them and gained the information he needed, and set to capture and kill Davina Marr.\nMeanwhile, Anton Shudder is possessed by a remnant and frees all the remnants from the Midnight Hotel. Tesseract also attacks Skulduggery Pleasant and his friends, who have Davina Marr. After killing Marr, Tesseract returns to the Torment to collect a payment, only to be almost killed and buried alive by his collaborators Graft and Ceryen. Tesseract escapes, killing Graft and infiltrating the Sanctuary. He kills Ceryen but is attacked by the Torment and other Children of the Spider. During the fight, however, remnants attack the Sanctuary, and Tesseract is possessed.\nAt Christmas time, after a Christmas dinner where Valkyrie notices that Carol and Crystal have become nicer people, Valkyrie is taken to Dr Nye, who seals her True name. However, Nye double-crosses her and attempts to perform experiments on her, making Valkyrie threaten it with Necromancy. After explaining to Skulduggery that she is Darquesse, they find Scapegrace and bring him to Grouse to prevent his body from decaying. In Roarhaven, Finbar has been mentally disturbed by remnants and Solomon Wreath is possessed. At Bespoke Tailors, Skulduggery, Ghastly, and the others are attacked by Remnant-possessed Wreath with two other sorcerers, forcing them to retreat.\nValkyrie and Fletcher go dancing, but everyone in the nightclub is possessed by remnants.

Originally published in two volumes in 1797 (Volume 1) and 1799 (Volume 2), respectively, the full title is Hyperion; or, The Hermit in Greece (German: \"Hyperion; oder, Der Eremit in Griechenland\"). Each volume is divided into two books, with each second book including an epigraph from Sophocles. The work is told in the form of letters from the protagonist, Hyperion, to his German friend Bellarmin, alongside a few letters between Hyperion and his love Diotima in the second volume of the novel, and is noted for its philosophical classicism and expressive imagery.",

Trask. H\u00f6lderlin began working on Hyperion in 1792, as a 22-year-old student at the T\u00fcbinger Stift. He further developed it while serving as a Hofmeister on the estate of Charlotte von Kalb, and put finishing touches to the novel while receiving lectures from Johann Gottlieb Fichte at the University of Jena.\nHyperion is set in Greece and deals with invisible forces, conflicts, beauty, and hope. It recounts Hyperion's attempts to overthrow the Turkish rule in Greece (in one of the footnotes H\u00f6lderlin specifically ties events in the novel with the Russians \"bringing a fleet into the Archipelago\" in 1770, framing the novel's events into the Orlov Revolt), his disillusionment with the rebellion, survival in the deadly Battle of Chesma, his devastation when Diotima dies of a broken heart before they can be reunited and his subsequent life as a hermit in the Greek wilderness, where he embraces the beauty of nature and overcomes the tragedy of his solitude. In the same time Hyperion after all these losses understands the limits of his idealized concept of Greece. An impossibility to travel becomes the essence of his travel.\nThe work contains Hyperions Schicksalslied (\"Hyperion's Song of Fate\"), an interpolated poem on which Johannes Brahms composed the Schicksalslied, Op. 54 between 1869 and 1871.\nIn Arnold Fanck's 1926 film Der Heilige Berg, Leni Riefenstahl's character Diotima is named after Hyperion's love.\nBetween 1960-1969 the Italian composer and conductor Bruno Maderna composed the opera Hyperion after H\u00f6lderlin's novel.\nThe Italian composer Luigi Nono included passages from Hyperion in his work Fragmente-Stille, an Diotima for string quartet as part of the score to be \"sung\" silently by the performers while playing the piece.\nIn 1983, the German sculptor Angela Laich created a sculpture named Hyperion, after the main character of the H\u00f6lderlin novel.\nHyperion is included in the 2006 literary reference book 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.\nHyperion or The Hermit in Greece translated by Willard R.

The novel begins just after the main character, Joss Moody, a famous jazz trumpeter, passes away. After his death, it is revealed that his biological sex was female, causing a news rush and attracting paparazzi, leading his widow, Millie, to flee to a vacation home. The truth was unknown to anyone except Millie; the Moodys lived their life as a normal married couple with a normal house and a normal family, and not even Colman, their adopted son, knew the truth. When Joss dies and the truth is revealed, Colman's shock spills into bitterness and he seeks revenge. He vents his rage about his father's lie by uncovering Joss's life to Sophie, an eager tabloid journalist craving to write the next bestseller. After time, and a visit to Joss's mother Edith Moore, Colman eventually finds love for his father muddled together with his rage. With his new-found acceptance of both his father and himself, Colman decides not to follow through with the book deal. All the while, Millie deals with her grief and the scandal in private turmoil at the Moodys' vacation home, and a variety of characters whose paths have crossed with Joss's give accounts of their memories and experiences. Each character aside from Sophie appears to either accept Joss's identity or regard it as irrelevant.\nTrumpet is mostly set in London in 1997. Memories of Joss's life give the book's setting a 70-year span beginning in 1927. Most of these memories are set in Glasgow in the 1960s, referring to locations such as The Barrowlands music venue at the start of Joss and Millie's relationship and their early marriage. Although much of the story takes place in London where the Moodys lived, it jumps back and forth between the city and the Scottish seaside home where Millie goes to escape the scandal and grieve in peace. The novel's end is set entirely in Scotland, where Colman and Sophie go to investigate Joss's birthplace.\nTrumpet is written with an intricate narration, incorporating many characters' points of view. The narration varies by chapter. Most of the story is told from the first-person perspective of Joss's wife Millie, his son Colman, and the journalist Sophie Stones. The narration often takes the form of the inner thoughts of these three characters, including visitations of their memories. Some chapters are Colman responding to Sophie Stones' interview. In addition, chapters told from a third-person omniscient narrator contribute to the story, each focusing on a different minor character, such as the funeral director or Joss's drummer.\nJackie Kay's choice to narrate Joss Moody's life through the voice of the people who he encountered/loved/played music with in life and death captures the function and consequences of trans necropolitics.\nThe central character is Joss Moody, a famous Black jazz musician. The novel begins in the wake of his death. Assigned female at birth and named Josephine Moore, Joss is transgender. He becomes a famous trumpet player and devotes his life to his passion of music. Joss is portrayed as a passionate lover, strict father, energetic friend, and dedicated artist.\nMillie Moody, a white woman, is married to Joss. As a young adult, she falls in love with Joss, and her passion is strong enough to overcome the truth about his original gender. After his death, Millie is devastated.

Millie is a loving, sympathetic character living out the cycles of grief under an unwanted spotlight.\nColman Moody is the adopted son of Millie and Joss. He is of mixed race. As a child, Colman was often difficult and misbehaved. Upon his father's death, Colman, aged 30, discovers that his father was assigned female at birth, and experiences a range of emotions including confusion, anger, embarrassment, and grief, which drives him to cooperate with a journalist, Sophie Stones, in her attempt to write Joss Moody's story.\nEdith Moore is Joss Moody's mother. She enters the novel only at the end.

One evening, while being physically abused by his father, David \"Davy\" Rice unexpectedly teleports (or \"jumps\") and finds himself in the local library, the Stanville Library. This is a place that Davy is familiar with and spends a lot of time in, which is why he was able to easily teleport there. The origin of this power is never explained, but he ends up using this power continually throughout the novel. Vowing never to return to his father's house, Davy makes his way to New York City. After being mugged and discovering that he can't get a job without a birth certificate and/or social security number, Davy robs a local bank by teleporting inside the safe, stealing nearly a million dollars. He then begins a life of reading, attending plays, and dining in fancy restaurants.\nAt a play, he meets a 21-year-old woman named Millie Harrison, and they spend some time touring New York before she returns to college in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Davy later visits her in Oklahoma, and they attend a party, where he accidentally runs into Millie's ex-boyfriend, Mark, who tries to fight him, forcing David to jump Mark away, unnoticed. Feeling bad for Davy, Millie invites him to stay the night at her place. The two officially start a romantic relationship and make love. Millie and Davy continue to see each other and begin to fall in love. Davy also manages to locate and reunite with his long-lost mother, Mary Niles. Mary left the family after being severely beaten by David's father, and all her attempts to contact David over the years were intercepted by his father.\nThe New York police start investigating Davy after he saves a neighbor from an attack by jumping her abusive husband to a park; the husband turns out to be a police officer. The investigation drives Davy to move to Oklahoma, where he gets an apartment near Millie. One night while Davy is out, the police are in his New York City apartment when Millie calls. The police inform her of their investigation of him. Davy confronts Millie and tries to explain, but Millie breaks up with him and tells him to go. Out of anger, Davy jumps in front of her, back to his apartment in Stillwater.\nAfter a few weeks, Davy finds himself missing Millie and starts receiving letters from her, a way of reconciling.\nMary, who was on a business trip, is murdered by terrorists when her plane is hijacked. Davy sets out to find Rashid Matar, the terrorist responsible for his mother's death. Davy starts jumping to Algeria to search for Matar, having to dodge the police almost every time he is there. While at Mary's funeral, Davy meets his father for the first time in years and is interrogated by the police again. While he is searching for the terrorist, he and Millie go out on their first date in months together. Davy tells her everything, even the bank robbery, which she's a little upset about. Despite everything that he has told her, his ability to jump and the money he stole, Millie confesses that she misses him and is deeply in love with him. Davy and Millie officially restart their relationship.\nHowever, the National Security Agency, led by veteran agent Brian Cox, becomes suspicious when it finds out he can get from Algeria to the United States in only a few hours. When he is questioned, Davy jumps out of the NSA office, witnessed by Cox and several other agents. Cox and the NSA then become determined to capture Davy so they can use his powers. David has Millie go stay with her parents, while at the same time they see each other in secret. After numerous failures to grab Davy, Cox takes Millie hostage in order to get to him. Davy strikes back by grabbing Cox, and later captures Matar and his abusive father\u2014thereby putting him in the unique position of controlling the fates of all three of his tormentors.\nThis experience has profound effects on all four of them. Davy finds himself unable to kill his captives despite their crimes against him and ultimately releases them. Davy turns Matar over to the authorities, threatening to come after him again if he isn't found guilty of his crimes. His father is forced to acknowledge his abuse of Davy and Mary and enters alcoholic counseling. Cox is forced to see the similarities between his actions and those of the terrorist and the wife-beating alcoholic, has Millie released, and agrees to stop hunting Davy. Both Davy and Millie go away with each other.\nAfterward, Millie comforts Davy as he realizes that he cannot escape his pain through teleportation or vigilante action, and he enters counseling as well.\nDavid \"Davy\" Rice\u00a0\u2013 The protagonist of the"

Star Light is a science fiction novel by American writer Hal Clement. It is the sequel to one of Clement's earlier books, Mission of Gravity. The novel was serialized in four parts in Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact Magazine from June to September 1970. Star Light was first published as a paperback book by Ballantine Books in September 1971.\nStar Light is set several decades after the events of Mission of Gravity. It takes place mostly on the supergiant planet Dhrawn, which some suspect of being a failed star. The planet has an ammonia/water atmosphere with some oxygen, at temperatures ranging from 70 Kelvins to almost the freezing point of water. The planet rotates extremely slowly, taking around two months for one revolution. It also has a long eccentric orbit around its star, which is a red dwarf, Lalande 21185. Much of the planet's heat seems to come from within. The gravity at the surface is 40 times the Earth's. Almost everything about the planet defies scientific theory, including its size, lack of hydrogen, its temperature, and the presence of free oxygen in its atmosphere.\nThe main theme revolves around hard science, particularly the physics and thermodynamics of mixtures. While water should be in the form of ice at all times on Dhrawn, the effect of ammonia in the atmosphere is to cause it to become a liquid under certain conditions of temperature and pressure, because of the formation of a eutectic mixture which melts and freezes at a much lower temperature than water. Although the scientists on the satellite attempt to supply weather forecasts for the Mesklinites, they are using tools designed for Earth's weather to predict conditions in a two-component water/ammonia system instead of Earth's one-component system. Even local effects, such as liberation of latent heat from mixtures undergoing freezing or condensation, can produce drastic changes in conditions. Seemingly solid surfaces can liquefy under the pressure of the land cruisers, even as individual Mesklinites can walk on them in complete safety.\nThe novel posits that full disclosure is best in a situation where unpredictable changes can occur. Ib Hoffman relates the story of how his son Benj, at the age of thirteen, designed and built SCUBA equipment, carefully calculating all the parameters, only to come close to dying on his first dive because he lacked a crucial piece of information about the physiology of breathing, one which all his knowledge of physics and engineering could not have predicted.\nStar Light title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database"

The Mount is a 2002 science fantasy novel by Carol Emshwiller. It won the Philip K.

The idea fascinated her enough to write a short story which became  The Mount.\nThe Hoots are a race that have evolved from prey. They are herbivores who have developed a set of very keen senses which allowed them to tame and use predators as mounts.

Unable to find employment at home, young Wellingborough Redburn signs on the Highlander, a merchantman out of New York City bound for Liverpool, England. Representing himself as the \"son of a gentleman\" and expecting to be treated as such, he discovers that he is just a green hand, a \"boy\", the lowest rank on the ship, assigned all the duties no other sailor wants, like cleaning out the \"pig-pen\", a longboat that serves as a shipboard sty. The first mate promptly nicknames him \"Buttons\" for the shiny ones on his impractical jacket. Redburn quickly grasps the workings of social relations aboard ship. As a common seaman he can have no contact with those \"behind the mast\" where the officers command the ship. Before the mast, where the common seaman work and live, a bully named Jackson, the best seaman aboard, rules through fear with an iron fist. Uneducated yet cunning, with broken nose and squinting eye, he is described as \"a Cain afloat, branded on his yellow brow with some inscrutable curse and going about corrupting and searing every heart that beat near him.\" Redburn soon experiences all the trials of a greenhorn: seasickness, scrubbing decks, climbing masts in the dead of night to unfurl sails, cramped quarters, and bad food. \nWhen the ship lands in Liverpool he is given liberty ashore. He rents a room and walks the city every day. One day in a street called Launcelott's Hey he hears \"a feeble wail\" from a cellar beneath an old warehouse and looking into it sees \"the figure of what had been a woman. Her blue arms folded to her livid bosom two shrunken things like children, that leaned toward her, one on each side. At first I knew not whether they were alive or dead. They made no sign; they did not move or stir; but from the vault came that soul-sickening wail.\" He runs for help but is met with indifference by a ragpicker, a porter, his landlady, even by a policeman who tells him to mind his own business. He returns with some bread and cheese and drops them into the vault to the mother and children, but they are too weak to lift it to their mouths. The mother whispers \"water\" so he runs and fills his tarpaulin hat at an open hydrant. The girls drink and revive enough to nibble some cheese. He clasps the mother's arms and pulls them aside to see \"a meager babe, the lower part of its body thrust into an old bonnet. Its face was dazzlingly white, even in its squalor; but the closed eyes looked like balls of indigo. It must have been dead for some hours.\" Judging them beyond the point at which medicine could help, he returns to his room. A few days later he revisits the street and finds the vault empty: \"In place of the woman and children, a heap of quick-lime was glistening.\"\nOn the docks he meets Harry Bolton, a dandy who claims to be a sailor looking for a job, and Redburn helps him procure a berth on the Highlander for the return voyage. They become fast friends and make a trip to London where they visit a luxurious private club, Aladdin's Palace, with an exotic environment Redburn struggles to make sense of, concluding it must be  a gambling house. The ship soon departs for New York and Bolton's deficits as sailor become apparent. Redburn suspects that Bolton has never been to sea before and Bolton is tormented by the crew. Jackson, after being ill in bed for four weeks, returns to active duty: he climbs to the topsail yard, then suddenly vomits \"a torrent of blood from his lungs\", and falls headfirst into the sea and disappears. The crew never speak his name again. Reaching port, Redburn heads for his home and Bolton signs on a whaler.

                "description": "Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life is the first book by American writer Herman Melville, published in the early part of 1846, when Melville was 26 years old. Considered a classic in travel and adventure literature, the narrative is based on the author's actual experiences on the island Nuku Hiva in the South Pacific Marquesas Islands in 1842, supplemented with imaginative reconstruction and research from other books. The title comes from the valley of Taipivai, once known as Taipi. Typee was Melville's most popular work during his lifetime; it made him notorious as the \"man who lived among the cannibals\".",

The book delivers quite a wild tale and from the beginning there were questions about whether any of it could possibly be true. Prior to the London edition of the book appearing within the Colonial and Home Library series (nonfiction accounts of foreigners in exotic places), the publisher John Murray required reassurance that Melville's experiences were first-hand.\n \nNot long after the initial publication of the book, many of the events described were corroborated by Melville's fellow castaway, Richard Tobias Greene (\"Toby\"). Additionally, an affidavit was found from the ship's captain that corroborated that both men did indeed desert the ship on the island in the summer of 1842.\nTypee attempts to be something of a work of proto-anthropology. Melville continually admits vast ignorance of the culture and language he is describing while also trying to bolster and supplement his own experiences with a great deal of other reading and research. He also has a tendency to employ a fair amount of hyperbole and attempts at humor. The book includes some dated and cringe-inducing lines and a few recent scholars have dedicated themselves to questioning the basic factuality of Melville's account. For instance, the length of stay on which Typee is based is presented as four months in the narrative and this was likely an extension and exaggeration of Melville's actual stay on the island. There is also not known to have ever been a lake on the island where Melville might have gone canoeing with Fayaway, as described in the book.\nTypee's narrative expresses a great deal of sympathy for the so-called savages, and even interrogates the use of that word, while focusing the most criticism on European marauders and various missionaries' attempts to evangelize:\nIt may be asserted without fear of contradictions that in all the cases of\noutrages committed by Polynesians, Europeans have at some time or\nother been the aggressors, and that the cruel and bloodthirsty\ndisposition of some of the islanders is mainly to be ascribed to\nthe influence of such examples.\n[The] voluptuous Indian, with every desire supplied,\nwhom Providence has bountifully provided with all the sources of\npure and natural enjoyment, and from whom are removed so many of\nthe ills and pains of life\u2014what has he to desire at the hands of\nCivilization?  Will he be the happier?  Let the once smiling and\npopulous Hawaiian islands, with their now diseased, starving, and\ndying natives, answer the question. The missionaries may seek to\ndisguise the matter as they will, but the facts are incontrovertible.\nCH 4\nThe Knickerbocker called Typee \"a piece of M\u00fcnchhausenism.\" New York publisher Evert Augustus Duyckinck wrote to Nathaniel Hawthorne that \"it is a lively and pleasant book, not over philosophical perhaps.\" In 1939, Charles Robert Anderson published Melville in the South Seas in which he elaborated on a number of Melville's likely sources in supplementing his work and also documented the existence of an affidavit from the Captain of the Acushnet. If the date provided by Captain can be considered accurate, Anderson concludes that Melville's stay in the \"Typee Valley\" part of the island would have been merely \"four weeks, or possible eight weeks at the most.\" However, in trying to determine the end date of Melville's stay, Anderson primarily relies on Melville's own internal accounts of various events, for instance that he was rescued from the valley on a \"Monday.\" In summing up his view of Typee, Anderson writes:\n For the general student of Melville, the detailed analysis and verification of these matters... probably reveals an accuracy scarcely to be expected. Without hesitation it can be said that in general this volume presents faithful delineation of the island life and scenery in precivilization Nukahiva, with the exception of numerous embellishments and some minor errors...\nAll of the initial back and forth which Melville experienced regarding the factuality of Typee may have had a chastening effect on him, as Anderson considers his next work, the book's sequel Omoo, \"the most strictly autobiographical of all Melville's works.\" But this second book also seems to have met with some skepticism, so that for his third book Mardi, Melville declares in the preface that he has decided to write a work of fiction under the supposition (half-joking) he might finally be believed: \nNot long ago, having published two narratives of voyages in the Pacific, which, in many quarters, were received with incredulity, the thought occurred to me, of indeed writing a romance of Polynesian adventure, and publishing it as such; to whether, the fiction might not, possibly be"

Italian Hours ends with the phrase, \"the luxury of loving Italy,\" and everything in the book indicates that James enjoyed this luxury to the fullest.  But he was by no means a blind lover.  His opening essay on Venice, for instance, doesn't gloss over the sad conditions of life for the city's people: \"Their habitations are decayed; their taxes heavy; their pockets light; their opportunities few.\"\nStill, James goes on to sketch enough of the beauty of Venice to make it seem a fair compensation.  Throughout the book he constantly comes back to the beauty and amenity of Italian life, despite the all too frequent material shortcomings.  Venice and Rome get the most extended treatment, but James doesn't neglect the rest of the country. His Roman essays, though, show the strongest touch of his own experiences, especially his long rides on horseback through the Campagna and his many walks through various neighborhoods in the city.\n\nFew critics have put up much of a struggle against the charm of Italian Hours, the most loving of all James' travel writings. The book is justly valued for its deep appreciation of Italian people, places and art. Although there are inevitable stylistic variations from the earlier essays to the latest, the unevenness hardly spoils the reader's enjoyment and may even add some welcome variety. Writing in The New York Times, critic Adam Begley writes that \"the spectacle of Henry James morphing into a lazy, contented, 'uninvestigating' tourist... gives [Italian Hours] a very satisfactory narrative arc.\"\nIn The Golden Bowl Maggie relates a pretty image of Amerigo's: \"He called it a 'serenade,' a low music that, outside one of the windows of the sleeping house, disturbed his rest at night... when finally, rising on tiptoe, he had looked out, he had recognised in the figure below with a mandolin, all duskily draped in her grace, the raised appealing eyes and the one irresistible voice of the ever-to-be-loved Italy.\" James could never resist the voice, either.\nBegley 2010.\nBegley, Adam (24 June 2010). \"Henry James Walked Here\".

The book collected various essays James had written on England over a period of more than thirty years, beginning in the 1870s.

England was James' adopted country, so it is not surprising that the essays in English Hours are primarily positive and sometimes downright cheerful. The essay on London which begins the book gives full play to the British capital's definitely non-beautiful impression on James when he arrived in 1869:\n\"It was not lovely - it was in fact rather horrible; but as I move again through dusky, tortuous miles, in the greasy four-wheeler to which my luggage had compelled me to commit myself, I recognize the first step in an initiation of which the subsequent stages were to abound in pleasant things.\"\nSome of the most pleasant things were James' trips to the English countryside, memorably described in essays such as \"North Devon,\" \"In Warwickshire\" and \"Old Suffolk.\" James grew particularly affectionate towards his eventual hometown of Rye, East Sussex and its surrounding area, as he recounts in \"Winchelsea, Rye and 'Denis Duval'.\"\nBut James never loses his love for the metropolis on the Thames, as \"he reflects with elation that the British capital is the particular spot in the world which communicates the greatest sense of life.\" He writes with unfailing enthusiasm of \"the dreadful, delightful city\" he would come to know so well.\n\nThe essays in English Hours were written over a span of some three decades, and differences in style are evident despite James' attempt to revise the book into more of a uniform entity. So the book cannot claim the intensity and unity of The American Scene, or even the more relaxed wholeness of A Little Tour in France.\nBut this poses no real problem for the reader, because James' attitudes toward England did not shift much during his long residence in the country. His knowing affection for \"this decent and dauntless people,\" as he would call the English during World War I, plays through all the essays regardless of their dates.\nJames, Henry (1993) Collected Travel Writings: Great Britain and America; [comprising] English Hours, The American Scene, Other Travels; annotated by Richard Howard.

They settled on a stretch of land and called it Virginia presumably, though by the time of the novel it has been corrupted to Virgenya. Clearly a reference to the first child born in the New World, Virginia Dare, and Virginia Colony.\nA more obscure reference is that of Marcomir of Hansa, who has an heir, presumably his son, named Beremund. Their race is modeled upon the ancient Germanic tribes, quite possibly the Franks. The use of the name Marcomer, a Frankish chieftain of antiquity, and his son Pharamond, serves to reinforce the cultural reference.\n2004, USA, Del Rey Books ISBN\u00a00-345-44067-6, Pub date 17 August 2004, Hardback\n2005, USA, Del Rey Books ISBN\u00a00-345-44071-4, Pub date 25 October 2005, Paperback\nhttp://www.sfsite.com/11a/cp187.htm\nhttp://www.sffworld.com/brevoff/83.html"

The story follows two brothers, Prosper and Boniface (Bo), who run away to Venice. There, they are taken in by a group of street children who live in an abandoned movie theater, the Stella, and are led by a proud orphan named Scipio. He appears to steal valuables and the group sells them to a sly shopkeeper, Ernesto Barbarossa. A customer of Barbarossa's, calling himself the Conte, asks the \"Thief Lord\" to steal a wooden lion's wing for him. The runaway boys' aunt and uncle figure out where they are and hire a detective, Victor Getz, to find them. Victor recognizes the boys on the street and manages to initiate a conversation with Bo, who innocently lets slip that he lives in  old movie theaters. When the other children see Victor, they cause a distraction and run away, taking his wallet with them. Victor visits the home of Dottor Massimo, the owner of the Stella, where he sees Scipio, who is actually the son of the rich Massimo.\nWhen Victor arrives at the Stella, the optic clan ambushes him. Prosper confronts Scipio, and learns he is indeed Dottor Massimo's son. While they are gone, Victor escapes, leaving a note that he will not reveal their location if they do not steal the lion's wing. The children leave that night to steal it from a woman named Ida Spavento. At her house, the children meet Scipio, who is also there to steal the wing. In the ensuing argument, Ida is awakened by the racket and confronts them with an old rifle. When they explain, Ida tells them the story of the wing: it is from a magical merry-go-round, which has the ability to change a person's age. She agrees to let them have the wing if they let her accompany them to the exchange. The next night, all the children except Hornet and Bo go to make the deal. They join Ida and Scipio, meet with the Conte and his sister, Morosina, and make the exchange. Afterwards, they follow the Conte through a maze of islands and arrive at one in particular called Isola Segretta. They watch as the pair unload the wing and go inside. Suddenly Ida drops her binoculars, and the sound travels to the island. Morosina rushes out with a shotgun and two huge dogs, and fires randomly into the night. The group speeds off and regroups at the pier. Returning to the theater, they find Hornet and Bo gone, and a note saying that police were at the door. They angrily confront Victor, who insists he did not direct the police's attention there. Adding to their misery, he tells them that the money they received is fake.\nWhile searching for Hornet and Bo, they find Hornet at an orphanage and manage to get her out. Bo, however, is not there. They spend a restless night at Ida's house. Prosper, sleepless, wanders outside; there he meets Scipio, who says they are going to get the money that is rightfully theirs. They travel back to the island and are caught climbing a wall by the Conte's sister. The two end up locked inside a stinking stable on the island. Meanwhile, Victor gets a phone call from Esther, the aunt, informing him that she had had Bo, but that he had misbehaved and run away. Victor finds Bo at the Stella and takes him back to Ida's, where they discover Prosper is missing.\nOn the island the next morning, Scipio and Prosper meet the Conte and Morosina, who are now both young children. They tell him that the magical merry-go-round worked. Scipio demands a ride and comes off an adult. Just as Scipio gets off the merry-go-round, Barbarossa arrives, and also demands a ride. Barbarossa becomes a seven-year-old boy, but accidentally breaks the merry-go-round. Scipio and Prosper leave after promising the Conte that they will not talk about the merry-go-round; Barbarossa will be forced to give the Conte all the money in his shop safe. The next day, everyone at Ida's home finds Prosper, Scipio, and Barbarossa. They do not recognize Scipio or Barbarossa and Prosper cannot explain. Scipio sets up a meeting between Barbarossa and Esther: Esther adores Barbarossa and his manners and decides to adopt him. Prosper, Bo, and Hornet decide to live with Ida and go to school, while Mosca and Riccio live in an abandoned warehouse. Scipio decides to work for Victor.\nEventually, Scipio and Prosper take another trip to the Isola Segreta, only to find that the Conte and Morosina have disappeared. Esther eventually catches Barbarossa stealing her jewelry and other possessions and sends him off to boarding school, where he becomes a menacing bully: he forces other children to do his homework, encourages them to steal, and makes them call him \"Thief Lord\". The adult Scipio works as Victor's assistant in his detective agency and is free"

Cythera is a science fiction novel by British writer Richard Calder, first published in 1998. While it is not explicitly advertised as a continuation of Calder's previous novels it does appear to be set in the same universe as his \"Dead Girls\" trilogy, as it references some of the background of the earlier novels and features two supporting characters - Kito and Mosquito - who were introduced in Dead Girls, though knowledge of these novels is not required to understand this stand-alone novel. Due to the timeline given the events of Cythera appear to take place before those of Dead Girls, making this a prequel of sorts.\nRichard Calder has said that the inspiration for the novel came from a series of news reports that he heard on the BBC World Service whilst living in Thailand which suggested that England was gripped by hysterical fear that bands of children were committing crime and mayhem and threatening to destroy society as we know it.\nThe reviewer in All Hallows the magazine of the Ghost Story Society treated the book as a modern ghost story. Earth 2 is also called fibrespace. It is the future of the Internet and individuals can be downloaded into this where they become effectively ghosts. Dhalia Chan the B movie actress lives on in fibrespace. However the real actress, called Jaruwan still exists in the real world, or Earth 1:\nIn a very real sense, Jaruwan is haunted by her doppelg\u00e4nger, Dahlia. As Jaruwan explains, 'You left me nothing, Dahlia...I had to tell our people not to head West, not to lose their souls like I had.' This is ultimately resolved in a science fictional way, of course, but we would say that Jaruwan gets her soul soul back.\nHis Own Aesthetic Richard Calder interviewed by Charles Rudkin Interzone #170 August 2001, page 25\nAll Hallows 26 February 2001 page 95 ISSN 1356-5567"

The Thief Lord is a children's novel written by Cornelia Funke. It was published in Germany in 2000 and translated into English by Oliver Latsch in 2002 for The Chicken House, a division of Scholastic publishing company. It was also adapted into a film in 2006.\nScipio Massimo: (pronounced ship-ee-oh) The Thief Lord. Bo alone is allowed to call him 'Scip' (although on one occasion Prosper is allowed to). He is thirteen, has dark brown eyes and raven black hair. He also wears a mask that he found. He is the former son of Dottor Massimo (what the other children first don't know). Scipio is clever and quick-witted, but he is hated and abused by his father and being talked to as if he were \"too stupid to put his own pants on.\" This feeling is so strong that it causes him to ride the magical merry-go-round and become older. Scipio, while having no care for his father, has a kind heart, especially for poor children such as Prosper, Bo, Riccio, Mosca and Hornet. He also seems to have a soft spot for cats. After becoming an adult, he abandons his father and becomes Victor's assistant and new adoptive son in his detective office and changes his name to Scipio Fortunato (\"the fortunate one.\").\nProsper Hartlieb: A 12-year-old orphan and brother of Boniface (Bo). He is very caring to all his friends and especially to his younger brother. Prosper has dark hair. He is described to always have a very serious look on his face. He tends to worry excessively, but is very mature. Prosper is sensitive and does not like stealing; he especially forbids Bo to steal in case Esther uses Bo's behavior against him. Since his mother's death, he has taken care of his brother by himself until taken in by Scipio.  He is also referred by his nickname \"Prop\" throughout the book.\nBoniface Hartlieb: Also known as Bo, Boniface is 5 year old orphan who ran away to Venice along with his brother, Prosper. He is described having \"blond hair and an angelic face.\" He admires Scipio and wants to grow up just like him, much to his brother's dismay.\nCaterina 'Hornet' Grimani: The only girl in the Stella cinema. Hornet used to live with Riccio and Mosca in the basement of an abandoned house. Scipio found them and took them to the Stella. She is described to be \"slender, with a brown plait braided down to her hips\". Her plait resembles a hornet's stinger, which is where she got her nickname, 'Hornet'. Hornet is an avid reader, and on occasion reads to the rest of the orphans. She is the only one of the children who is not afraid to stand up to Scipio. Hornet still has got parents, but she doesn't want to live with them.\nRiccio: (Pronounced Ree-choh) A scrawny boy and smaller than Prosper (but claims not to be much younger). He has brown hair that sticks out everywhere, earning him his nickname, Hedgehog. He has missing teeth, which he lost in a chase. His bed is stuffed with stuffed animals and comics.  He grew up in an orphanage, never knowing his parents.  Scipio found Riccio when Riccio attempted to steal something off of him.\nMosca: A tall, muscular boy of African descent. Riccio says that his skin is so dark that \"he could creep through the shadows\". He loves the water and made his own boat. Mosca loves tinkering with his radio. Although he does not speak of his past, he is said to have a horrible family that he dislikes.\nVictor Getz: A detective looking for Bo and Prosper hired by Esther and Max Hartlieb. He likes collecting disguises, especially false beards, and has lived in Italy for 15 years. He speaks both English (his mother tongue) and Italian. He chases after Prosper and Riccio on their way back from Barbarossa's. He is kidnapped by the children, and later escapes, but gives his word he will not tell where they are. Esther referred to him after going to the police who were no help. He soon befriends the children and lies to Esther, saying the boys left Venice. Victor has two pet tortoises named Lando and Paula.\nIda Spavento: A nice lady who looks after the kids for a while and, at the end of the book, takes in Prosper, Bo, and Hornet. She is an orphan and grew up in an orphanage. She found the Conte's wing during her early life at the orphanage and kept it until she gave it to Scipio's gang to sell to the Conte. She also has a bad smoking habit, but she is trying to quit.\nEsther Hartlieb: Prosper and Bo's rich aunt.  She only wants to keep Bo because he looks like an angel. She is very biased toward Prosper and wanted him to go to a boarding school (where he could hardly see Bo). She hires Victor to find the two boys and ends up adopting Barbarossa (as a child after he had taken a ride"

The novel explores the relationship between a 44-year-old divorced children's book author and artist, Jeremy Walker, and a 16-year-old runaway who attaches herself to him. Unaware of who Belinda really is, Jeremy falls in love with her and paints her portraits nude. When he discovers Belinda's true identity, things unravel quickly as his career and freedom are threatened, as well as the love he feels for Belinda. The novel narrates the sexual union between Jeremy and Belinda, managing to convey their love for one another through physical action, but without spending pages and pages describing each individual sexual encounter.\nThe novel deals with an illegal relationship: the age of consent in California, where most of the novel's events take place, is 18. When Belinda meets Jeremy Walker, she is 16 years old. Her name is Belinda Blanchard, her mother is international movie and television star Bonnie. Belinda is estranged from her mother and on the run from her controlling but generally clueless Uncle Daryl, who is convinced that Belinda is out to ruin Bonnie's career. Jeremy Walker doesn't know any of this until he is in love with Belinda, and they have been together for several months. The novel describes numerous relationships with large age gaps, including one between Belinda's world-famous hairdresser father, G.G. and an actor named Ollie Boon. Although Belinda is the only character who is a minor, and is much younger than any of the other characters, the novel raises the question whether genuine love can exist between two people with a large age difference, and whether or not it is morally right.\nBelinda was published originally in hardcover in October 1986 by Arbor House, as well as published in softcover by Fitzhenry & Whiteside Ltd., at the same time.

In its first (1801) and second (1802) editions, Juba, an Black servant, marries an English farmgirl named Lucy. The third edition of the book, published in 1810, omitted the character Juba, and instead has Lucy betrothed to one James Jackson.

Belinda is a young lady who lives with her aunt, Mrs. Stanhope. Being unwed, Belinda is sent to live with Lady Delacour, whom Belinda considers fascinating and charming. Lady Delacour believes herself to be dying of breast cancer. She hides her emotional distress caused by her impending death and poor relationships with her family from Belinda through wit and charm. The first half of the novel is concerned with the blooming friendship between Belinda and Lady Delacour, which is broken by Lady Delacour's fear that Belinda plans to marry Lord Delacour, as expressed in the line, \"I see...that she [Belinda] who I thought had the noblest of souls has the meanest! I see that she is incapable of feeling.\"\nBelinda subsequently moves to the home of the Percival family, the embodiment of the ideal family. Once Lady Delacour seeks treatment for her illness, Belinda returns to support her. Upon her visit to the doctor, Lady Delacour discovers her disease is not terminal and reconciles herself with Belinda. She eventually makes a full recovery from her illness.\nLady Delacour: A fashionable bel esprit (woman of wit), who Belinda at first considers \"the most agreeable\u2014no, that is too feeble an expression\u2014the most fascinating person she had ever beheld\". Later, however, after Belinda hears her unhappy history, she feels \"astonishment\u2014pity\u2014admiration\u2014and contempt\". She is very kind and considerate to Lady Delacour, who begins to feel affectionate towards her. Through Belinda's gentleness, Lady Delacour begins to be kinder to her husband, and grows warmer towards her daughter Helena. However, Lady Delacour's sudden jealousy towards Belinda makes Belinda part with her and go to the Percivals' house, where Helena had formerly been staying. Later, Lady Delacour finds out that she had absolutely no foundation for her jealousy, and being very ill, begs Belinda to come back to her. Belinda rejoins her, and now contrite and humbled, Lady Delacour takes Belinda's advice and reconciles with her husband \u2013 even telling him about her mysterious history and her fears that she has cancer. Lord Delacour is affectionately concerned. She goes to obtain surgery, and is told that she has not cancer at all! The quack doctor she had been going to in her desperation had given her certain medicines to increase her pain and agitation, to feed her fears. Joyfully, she decides to cast aside her folly and dissipation, and uses her talents energetically to be a good wife, a fervent friend, and a kind mother, and she ends the book by saying laughingly, \"Now, Lady Delacour, to show that she is reformed, comes forward to address the audience with a moral\u2014a moral!\u2014yes,\nOur tale contains a moral, and no doubt,\n\nYou all have wit enough to find it out.\"\nHer strong character and the very important part she plays in the novel make some critics think the book should bear her name instead of Belinda's.\nBelinda Portman: a young lady of about seventeen, \"handsome, graceful, sprightly, and highly accomplished\". She has excellent abilities, but is unused to thinking for herself, for her aunt has chiefly directed her actions (though her thoughts are often very different). Belinda is innocent and loving, and feels affection towards Clarence Hervey, though she hardly admits it even to herself. Mr. Vincent and Sir Philip both wish to marry her. She is generous and warmly forgiving, as seen when she sincerely forgives Lady Delacour, but has great self-control over her emotions \u2013 for example, she keeps her face straight and does not blush later when people talk about Clarence Hervey, and is not shaken by Mrs. Freke's vow to be her \"sworn enemy\". This rationality, however, led some contemporary critics to call her cold, and though in response Edgeworth made some minor changes to her second edition of 1802, she did not change the substance of Belinda.\nClarence Hervey: An eccentric, idealistic young man, who is clever, witty, and gallant, and in Belinda's first impression of him is thus worded: \"a most uncommonly pleasing young man\". He is shown to have a warm heart, for he frankly asks Lady Delacour to make his peace with Belinda after he spoke rashly about her. He admires Lady Delacour, and endeavors to \"reform\" her; and being constantly of her party, he begins to admire Belinda. However, he had been secretly bringing up the innocent Virginia in an attempt to create a perfect wife, and now, thinking that in all honor he must marry Virginia, he struggles vainly to relinquish the lovely and intelligent Belinda. This almost ruins all hope of happiness; but Virginia reveals to him that she loves somebody else (or actually, to be more exact, the \"figure\" of Captain Sunderland \u2013 for she has never actually met him). Thus freed from all restraint, he confesses his love for"

The novel is considered an outstanding work in modern Sinhalese fiction due to the significance of its theme and the sophistication of its technique. The story is based on a virtuous character called Aravinda, a Sinhalese youth raised in a traditional Buddhist family in the South. First published in 1956 in Sinhala, the novel was translated into English language in 1985 by Professor Ashley Halpe, under the title The Way of the Lotus. It was later translated into the Tamil language in 1992 and French in 1995.

The novel starts with Sammy, a common friend of Aravinda Jayasena and Siridasa Jayasena, visiting Siridasa. Siridasa and his wife, Sarojini welcome Sammy and relays him the news of Aravinda's death. Sammy is interested in mysticism and occulticism which compelled him to travel India. He shares Aravinda's passion of metaphysics, ancient lore and alchemy. Sammy is grief stricken to hear the death of Aravinda at a relatively young age. Siridasa tells him of the final days of Aravinda and gives him a book which appeared to be the Aravinda's diary. The narration then shifts to first person and the reader meets Aravinda. Aravinda starts his story with a special introduction of his father who works as a local physician (Veda Mahattaya) to make the ends meet. Commonly known as Jayasena Veda Mahattaya, Aravinda's father is sought after by villagers when someone is ill. He visits them and treat them with traditional ayurvedic medication which he makes a servant produce at his own house. Aravinda then recalls Sarojini, a classmate of Aravinda and a daughter of a wealthy merchant. Sarojini expresses her interest in Aravinda and two enjoy each other's company. Aravinda's elder sister Menaka is married to Dharmadasa. Aravinda is forced to take biology to be a doctor but he declines to be one and becomes a government clerk. Meanwhile Sarojini proposes him to elope and start a family, but Aravainda does not accept the proposal. Grief stricken Sarojini agrees with her parents to marry Siridasa, Aravinda's cousin.Aravinda's father dies and his mother finds out that her husband has mortgaged the house to Dharmadasa for three thousand rupees. Frustrated mother leaves the house despite  her daughter's pleas that she and Aravinda can stay at their home until they die. Aftet the departure of mother, Menaka and Dharamada move house to Aravinda's place. Aravinds pursues his career at the government office. One day, he accidentally makes an explosion in his own room while trying new chemical experiments. Realising that he is a threat to his own nephew, Sirimal, Menaka and Dharmada's son, he decides to leave the house and to rent a place. He employs Gunawathi as housemaid who has a ten year old girl named Bathee with whom Aravinda builds up a father-daughter relationship. Aravinda gives her a school education despite the criticisms of his elder sister Menaka. Kulasuriya,a retired postmaster who wanders in the village aimlessly encourages Aravinda's existentialist ideology and they enjoy each other's company. Now Bathee is grown up and she is in love with a driver named Jinadasa. Aravinda is jealous and worried to see that Bathee'a attention is completely diverted to Jinadasa. Aravinda asks Jinadasa to meet him and buys him a used car and marries him off to Bathee. After their marriage, Aravinda falls ill and Jinadasa and Bathee come to nurse him. Sarojini comes to visit Aravinda and he admits that he had both loved and not loved Sarojini and Bathee. Aravinda's illness worsened and he ponders his own life.  Aravinda makes peace with himself and he is detached from all the worldly relationships drawing the title of the novel Viragaya (detachment). Aravinda passes away and people come in numbers to pay last tribute to Aravinda; the writer alludes that the villagers have intuitively understood Aravinda's good qualities even though he is ridiculed and criticised by the middle class in society.\nGamperaliya\nMadol Doova\nYuganthaya\nKaliyugaya\nDe Silva, K.

It follows the events during eight and a half years, spent behind bars under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi. Cherveniashka, together with six more medics, was accused of being involved in the mass murder of hundreds of Libyan children, by deliberately infecting them with the HIV virus in a hospital in Benghazi. She was sentenced to death several times between 2002 and 2007, and released after political negotiations on 24 July 2007.",

Yordanov met Cherveniashka during filming of the TV show \"Psychic Challenge\" in 2008, and proposed that they write the book together. They met several times in her daughter's apartment in Sofia. The process took one and a half years, and the first edition was published in November 2009.\nIn 1999 seventeen Bulgarian nurses were kidnapped from a hospital in Benghazi, Libya where they worked and were confined in a police station in the capital Tripoli. During the next eight and a half years five of the nurses, including Cherveniashka, were held in different prisons accused of deliberately infecting more than 400 children with HIV. They survived torture, physical and mental abuse, and several death sentences, before their liberation in 2007. Cherveniashka told her story to her co-author one year after her return to Bulgaria.\nAll of the defendants in the case claim that they had been tortured. In the chapters \"The Red Carpet\", \"The Hell in Me\", and \"Death Women Walking\" Cherveniashka describes in details tens of different methods of torture she experienced, including drowning, beating, hanging, dog attacks and many more. She was also subjected to psychological violence, such as simulated infection with the HIV virus, and  executions of other prisoners meters away from her cell.\nThe book was first published in Bulgaria by \"Hermes Books\" as \"\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0430\u0434\u0430: \u0423\u0436\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432 \u043b\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\" (\"Notes from Hell: The Horror of the Libyan Prisons\") on November 20, 2009. On December 2, 2009, it was presented by Bulgaria's ex-foreign Minister of International Affairs - Solomon Passy, who worked active on medics release.\nIn March 2010 \"Notes from Hell\" was published in Southern Africa by \"30\u00b0 South Publishers\" as \"Notes from Hell: A Bulgarian Nurse in Libya\".\n\"Notes From Hell\" was re-issued as e-book by \"30\u00b0 South Publishers\" in 2011. Three years later it was published again in Bulgarian and English by \"NY Creative and Publishing\".[11] It's available on various formats, including epub, mobi, PDF and Kindle on Amazon, iTunes, Barnes and Noble, etc., as well in the major online libraries.\nIn 2017, marking tenth anniversary of the medics liberation, a French language edition was published with different cover and new subtitle as \"Notes from Hell: A True Story\".\nIn 2018 British actress Nano Nagle recorded Cherveniashka's confession in audiobook adaptation of the story.\n\nThe book received positive reviews in Bulgaria, the country Chervinashka is from. A journalist from Standart newspaper called it \"a significant topic of discussion\". Another newspaper, Telegraph praises the title as \"one of the most emotional and revealing confessions\". Television journalist Ani Tzolova described it as \"powerful story\".\nIn South Africa Notes from Hell also received positive reaction from the critics. According to Michelle Bristow-Bovey from Cape Times, \"Notes from Hell\" documents more than a decade of torture, cruelty and despair. This intimate account is relayed with raw honesty and emotion. A cold, sobering look at some of life's injustices.\" Dries Brunt from Citizen claims that \"...This story shows brutality in its most extreme form, a wilful act of cruel injustice for which the Libyan government stands accused.

Along Came a Spider is a crime thriller novel, and the first novel in James Patterson's series about forensic psychologist Alex Cross. First published in 1993, its success has led to twenty six sequels as of 2021. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 2001, starring Morgan Freeman as Cross.\nAlex Cross: An African-American forensic psychologist as well as a detective, described as good-looking and well-built. He is often referred to as \"Doctor Detective\". Despite being very dedicated to his job, he manages to be a devoted father to his two children. His wife, Maria, was killed in a shooting before the novel begins and he is romantically involved with Jezzie Flannagan before he finds out her role in Maggie Rose's disappearance.\nJezzie Flannagan: Before the kidnapping of Maggie Rose and Michael Goldberg, she held an esteemed position in the Secret Service\u2014the first woman ever to hold the position. She is described as very beautiful, though she confides in Alex that she wishes she'd been born plain so she wouldn't have to face as much sexism in her workplace. As a white woman romantically involved with Alex (an African-American man), she faces racism, though she handles it better than Alex does. Both her parents were alcoholics, and her father committed suicide. She names them as \"smart failures\", or brilliant people who never made anything of their lives. When Alex confronts her about her betrayal, she admits that she approached him at first strictly to get information on what the cops knew, but that she later fell in love with him and his children.\nGary Murphy/Soneji: As a boy, he was physically and sexually abused by his father and stepmother, which caused him to develop a split personality. Gary Murphy is a normal, all-American father and husband, while Gary Soneji is a cold-blooded predator who fantasizes about kidnapping and burying a baby alive at twelve and orchestrates the kidnapping of Maggie Rose and Michael Goldberg. He has an obsession with being famous, and wants to be the most feared criminal in America.\n\nA film adaptation of the same name was released on April 6, 2001, starring Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross, Monica Potter as Jezzie Flannagan, and Michael Wincott as Gary Soneji. The adaptation makes substantial changes to the plot, omitting much of Soneji's background and his split personality, as well as changing the identity of the kidnapped children's parents and many characters' eventual fate.\n"

Cowl is a 2004 science fiction novel by British writer Neal Asher. The novel deals with time travel and an epic time war between two factions from the 43rd century. Asher first started working on the novel as a novella named Cowl At The Beginning, which he eventually developed into the full novel Cowl.\nCritical reception to Cowl was mostly positive, with fan reaction being mixed. SFRevu praised the novel, citing it as \"fast moving\". U-T San Diego and the Denver Post both gave positive reviews, with U-T San Diego calling it a \"whopping good story\". SF Site wrote that while the book was \"satisfying simply as an adventure story, Asher's ambition and obvious knowledge of the field suggest that with a little more time for character-development and exploring individual motivations, Cowl could have set new standards for the time-travel novel, instead of settling for being an entertaining up-date of a classic tradition.\" Kirkus Reviews cited that while the \"time-travel rationale holds up ... it\u2019s impossible to understand the motivations of the movers and shakers\", which kept them from caring about what happened next. SF Crowsnest wrote that Cowl was initially hard to get into but that the book had a \"satisfying climax\". January Magazine stated that they were \"breathless\" from Cowl but that there was \"just so much to take in\".\nJarrold, John. \"Neal Asher interviewed by John Jarrold\". Infinity Plus.

Knopf). Sam Spade is a private detective in San Francisco, in partnership with Miles Archer. The beautiful \"Miss Wonderley\" hires them to follow Floyd Thursby, who she claims has run off with her sister. Archer takes the first stint but is found shot dead that night. Thursby is also killed later and Spade is a suspect. The next morning, Spade coolly tells his office secretary, Effie Perine, to have the office door repainted to read simply \"Samuel Spade\".\n\"Miss Wonderley\" is soon revealed to be an acquisitive adventuress named Brigid O'Shaughnessy, who is involved in the search for a black statuette of unknown but substantial value. Others are after this falcon, including Joel Cairo, an effeminate Levantine homosexual, and Casper Gutman, a fat man accompanied by a vicious young gunman, Wilmer Cook. O'Shaughnessy begs for Spade's protection while telling him as little as possible. They meet with Cairo at Spade's apartment, and Spade again presses O'Shaughnessy for details; again she stalls but kisses Spade. The next morning, she is asleep in his bed. Leaving her there, Spade slips out to search her apartment. \nEffie believes O'Shaughnessy \"is all right\" and Spade should help her. Effie agrees to hide her at her own home, but O'Shaughnessy disappears again. When Spade meets Gutman in his hotel room, neither will tell what he knows. Spade implies he is looking out for himself, not O'Shaughnessy. Red herrings abound. The police suspect Spade in the shootings: he was bedding Archer's wife, Iva. The District Attorney ties the shootings to Dixie Monahan, a Chicago gambler who had employed Thursby as a bodyguard in the Far East.\nAt a second meeting, Gutman tells Spade the history of the falcon. It was made of gold and jewels by the 16th-century Knights of Malta as a gift to the King of Spain but was captured by pirates. After passing from owner to owner, at some time it was coated with black enamel to conceal its value. Gutman traced the falcon to General Kemidov, a Russian exile in Constantinople and hired O'Shaughnessy to get it; she brought in Cairo to help. O'Shaughnessy and Thursby fled with the falcon to Hong Kong and from there to San Francisco. During this conversation, Gutman drugs Spade, who passes out on the floor.\nSpade awakens alone and returns to his office where a wounded ship's captain staggers in with a package containing the falcon and dies. O'Shaughnessy calls the office, begs for Spade's help, but sends him on a wild goose chase. When he returns, O'Shaughnessy is waiting in front of Spade's apartment building. Inside Spade's apartment they find Gutman, Wilmer, and Cairo in wait with guns drawn. Gutman presents $10,000 in cash for the falcon, but Spade argues that the police must arrest someone for the murders. During a fight, Spade knocks Wilmer out, and Gutman agrees to give Wilmer to the police.\nSpade has Effie fetch the falcon, but Gutman discovers it is a fake (a decoy made by General Kemidov). During the excitement, Wilmer escapes. Gutman decides to go to Constantinople for the real falcon; Cairo joins him and they leave. Spade then calls the police and tells them the story, adding that he has Wilmer's guns and other evidence. While they are waiting, he bullies O'Shaughnessy into confessing her real role. \nArcher was shot with Thursby's gun, but by her. She has lied to him and double-crossed him. O'Shaughnessy admits all this, but pleads that she is in love with Spade. Maybe he does care for her, Spade admits, but \"I won't play the sap for you\"\u00a0\u2013 for personal as well as professional reasons. If she can get off with a long prison term, he'll wait for her; but if she hangs, so be it. When the police arrive, he turns her in, and the police tell him Wilmer has just shot Gutman dead.\nAlthough Hammett himself worked for a time as a private detective for the Pinkerton Detective Agency in San Francisco (and used his given name, Samuel, for the story's protagonist), Hammett asserted that \"Spade has no original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the private detectives I worked with would like to have been, and, in their cockier moments, thought they approached.\"\nHammett reportedly drew upon his years as a detective in creating many of the other characters for The Maltese Falcon, which reworks elements from some of his stories published in Black Mask magazine in 1925, \"The Whosis Kid\" and \"The Gutting of Couffignal\". The novel was serialized in five parts in Black Mask in 1929 and 1930 before being published in book form in 1930 by Alfred A. Knopf.\nThe novel has been adapted for film four times, twice under its original title: \nThe Maltese Falcon"

Meeting by chance at an art exhibition, the flamboyant collector Mr Shaitana tells Hercule Poirot of his personal crime-related collection and invites him to a dinner party to see it. Scoffing at the idea of collecting mere artefacts, Shaitana explains that he collects only the best exhibits: criminals who have evaded justice.\nPoirot's fellow guests include three other crime professionals: secret serviceman Colonel Race,  mystery writer Mrs Ariadne Oliver, and Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard; along with four people Shaitana believes to be murderers: Dr Roberts, Mrs Lorrimer, Anne Meredith, and Major Despard. Shaitana taunts his suspects with comments that each understands as applying only to them.\nThe guests retire to play bridge, the crime professionals playing in one room while the others play in a second room where Shaitana relaxes by the fire. As the party breaks up, Shaitana is found to be dead  \u2013 stabbed in the chest with a stiletto from his own collection. None of the suspects can be ruled out, as all had left their places at the table during the evening. Leading the police investigation, Superintendent Battle agrees to put his \"cards on the table\" and to allow the other professionals to make their own enquiries. Poirot concentrates on the psychology of the murderer.\nThe investigators look into the suspects' histories: the husband of one of Dr Roberts' patients died of anthrax shortly after accusing the doctor of improper conduct; a botanist that Despard had been guiding through the Amazon was rumoured to have been shot. Anne's housemate Rhoda Dawes tells Mrs Oliver in confidence about an incident that Anne has been concealing, when an elderly woman for whom Anne was acting as companion died after mistaking poison for syrup of figs. Mrs Lorrimer's husband had died twenty years earlier, though little is known about that.\nMrs Lorrimer asks Poirot to visit her, tells him that she has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness and wishes to confess to killing both her husband and Shaitana. Poirot refuses to believe her psychologically capable of spontaneous murder and thinks that she is protecting Anne. Mrs Lorrimer reluctantly discloses that she had actually seen Anne commit the crime, but feels sympathy for a young girl who is just starting out in life. The next day, each of the other suspects receives in the morning's post a confession and suicide note. Battle informs Poirot by telephone that although several people had rushed to her house it was too late, and she had died of an overdose. Poirot is again suspicious, as he knows that Anne had visited the previous night. He discovers that Mrs Lorrimer could not have sent the letters.\nRealising that Rhoda's life may be in danger (she being the only person who might give Anne away), Poirot, Battle, and Despard race to Rhoda's cottage, arriving just as Anne \u2013 out on the river \u2013 attempts to drown her. In the event, Anne herself drowns while Rhoda is rescued by Despard.\nPoirot explains his findings. Although Despard had indeed shot and killed the botanist, that had been not murder but an accident. Anne poisoned her employer by switching two bottles to conceal her petty thieving. Although Mrs Lorrimer thought she had seen Anne kill Shaitana, Anne had in fact just leaned forward to touch him, realising he was already dead.\nPoirot explains that only one person was psychologically capable of carrying out a spur-of-the-moment stabbing, namely Dr Roberts. Believing that Shaitana meant to reveal him as the anthrax killer, Roberts quickly took his chance. He covered his tracks by forging Mrs Lorrimer's letters and killing her with an injection when he was first to arrive at her house the next morning. Although Roberts initially protests, he is forced to confess when Poirot reveals a surprise eye-witness, a window-cleaner. After Roberts is led away, Rhoda notes what amazing luck it was that the window cleaner had been there at the exact moment of the fatal injection. Poirot replies that it had not been luck at all, and introduces them to the actor whose presence had prompted Roberts' confession.\nWith the murder solved, Despard courts Rhoda.\nHercule Poirot \u2013 Belgian private detective. A guest at Shaitana's dinner party.\nAriadne Oliver \u2013 Crime fiction writer, and Poirot's friend. A guest at Shaitana's dinner party.\nSuperintendent Battle \u2013 A top detective from Scotland Yard who likes to project a professional image of stolidity, with a wooden expression.

Henry Lawson has long since earned the right to be heard in both prose and verse; indeed, he is familiar to readers as are many of the verses in this new volume of his; but yet in one way we find a new Lawson, a man who has evidently upon him the spirit of repentance for something done, and a strong desire to make amends. So strong are these evidences, and so directly put, that it is impossible to dissociate them from a personal application.\"\nA reviewer in The Age was less than impressed: \"It is to be feared that even the most ardent of Mr. Lawson's admirers will look upon this book of verse as a disappointment. It represents the results of bis five years' work since he returned from England in 1900 \u2014 years that for various reasons must be considered the blackest of his life \u2014 and the unevenness of that work is almost painful to contemplate now that we have it in bulk. Only occasionally does he display any gleam \u2014 and then only a fleeting one \u2014 which bears any promise of better things in the future.\"\nFull text of the collection at Setis.\n1905 in Australian literature\n1905 in poetry\nAustlit - When I Was King and Other Verses by Henry Lawson\n\"Literature\", The Queenslander, 16 December 1905, p27\n\"New Books\", The Age, 9 December 1905, p6\nWhen I Was King and Other Verses by Henry Lawson"

What distinguishes this variation on Lewis Carroll's classic from others is that the story is told entirely in rhyming verse. It begins the same as Carroll's original, with a languid Alice perking up \"When first she spies the clock of clocks/Within the rabbit's paw\". After following the time-obsessed creature Down the Rabbit-Hole Again, she discovers The Bottle & the Biscuit Box in the \"hall of many doors,\" and after drinking and shrinking and eating and growing (and shrinking again), she is \"swept away upon a pool of tears.\" The first real departure from the original text comes in the 3rd verse, where, after being instructed by the Caterpillar in proper Wonderland speech (The Caterpillar's Lesson on Rhetoric & Rhyme), she is given the chance to impress the imperious insect with her oratory skills in The Mariner's Tale, a dark poem more akin to How Doth the Little Crocodile than the You Are Old, Father William poem she quoted for the Caterpillar in Carroll's original book. The Caterpillar gives his earnest (if somewhat slanted) critique of her recital in the 5th verse (The Subjective Review) before taking flight on mechanical wings (as depicted in the accompanying illustration). The 5th verse finds Alice in familiar company once again with The Cook, the Pig, the Cat & His Duchess, as the Cheshire Cat tells her the tale of the conflict between the Duchess and the Cook, revealing that the pig-babies raised by the Duchess are bred as food for the Queen's banquets.\nThe most pivotal departure from Carroll's original text comes in the 7th verse, \"The Tea Party Resumes\", where it is first hinted at (by a sleep-talking Dormouse) that the Knave of Hearts may not in fact be responsible for the theft of the Queen's tarts. Through rapid wordplay and cunning juxtaposition, both the Mad Hatter and March Hare attempt to muddy the facts and confuse Alice \u2014 though, the astute reader will glean much from the Dormouse's revelation on the matter of the Queen's missing tarts. The 8th verse, offers a brief respite from the main action with A Slight Detour Through the Looking-Glass, which serves not only as a catchall recap of Carroll's follow up book but also as an introduction to the subsequent three verses: Dee & Dum (the 9th verse) and The Battle (the 11th verse) which function as a wraparound for the 10th verse, The Walrus & the Carpenter Head Back (the epic sequel to Carroll's masterpiece The Walrus and the Carpenter), in which the tables are turned on the title characters \"who once dined on the shore\".\nThe 12th verse, In the Garden of Hearts, returns Alice to Wonderland, \"where the trial (of the Knave of Hearts) is about to begin!\" In the 13th verse (The Trial Begins) the King of Hearts presides over the court just as he did in Chapters 11 & 12 of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, with the Queen at his side, and the White Rabbit in the role of the court reporter, reading the now famous single stanza verse the Queen of Hearts (a second stanza has been added that only further accentuates the absurdity of the charge against the accused). The major departure from Carroll's original here is that instead of appearing as jittery witnesses, the Mad Hatter and March Hare are cast as Counsel for the Defense and Prosecutor, respectively. After the charge is read, the Hare addresses the court with an opening statement that more or less vindicates the accused, before turning his accusing eye upon the court itself for failing to serve tea with the evidence (the tarts). The King concurs and calls for a brief recess, during which the bulk of the evidence is consumed by all present. The trial resumes in the 14th verse with The Hatter's Defence, in which the Hatter presents an alternately flattering and damning portrait of the accused. In the 15th verse (The Hare's Rebuttal & the Hatter's Rebuke) the jury is making ready to deliberate when the Hare suddenly chimes in again with a counter argument that is more damning to himself and opposing counsel than it is to the accused, and only after a decisive rebuke from the Hatter does the Hare retract his \"erroneous rebuttal\", at which point the King allows there is \"time for yet one final pleading.\" In the 16th verse The Knave of Hearts Repents with a haunting poetic plea directed specifically at the Queen of Hearts, who offers her own poetic response in the 17th verse The Queen's Sentence. The 18th Verse, The Royal Flush, pandemonium breaks out, much the same as it did in Carroll's original, with Alice challenging the court, while the Hatter and Hare try to trap the Dormouse who has run amok, and the jury takes flight. As the Queen demands"

Saga of Old City is a 1985 fantasy novel by Gary Gygax, set in the world of Greyhawk, which is based on the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game.\nGary Gygax wrote a short story, \"At Moonset Blackcat Comes\", that appeared in the special 100th issue of Dragon in August 1985.  This introduced Gord the Rogue to gamers just before Saga of Old City was scheduled to be released. Saga of the Old City was published in 1985; this and its sequel Artifact of Evil were the only two novels published under TSR's Greyhawk Adventures written by Gygax.\nThis was Gygax's first novel, and it was edited by Kim Mohan. It was the first Greyhawk novel.\nIn 2008 Troll Lord Games released a new hard cover reprinting of Saga of Old City.\nIn the Io9 series revisiting older Dungeons & Dragons novels, Rob Bricken commented that \"I feel very weird about hating a novel written by the father of Dungeons & Dragons, but there's nothing fantastic about the fantasy in Saga of Old City. It's just deeply, deeply unpleasant. So while I might give the technical writing a 4 on a 1d20\u2014he's more competent at scene and actions descriptions than R.A. Salvatore in The Crystal Shard, at least Salvatore's characters were distinct and memorable\u2014but a penalty of -2, along with a -3 for its outright misogyny.

The building is described having a stainless steel facade, with tinted green windows.\nIn the morning mail, Will Giddings, \"Clerk Of The Works,\" or on-site representative of the owner, \"The World Tower Corporation,\" receives an anonymous envelope containing electrical-design change authorizations that no one in the offices of Caldwell Associates, Supervising Architects (represented on-site by Nathan Hale \"Nat\" Wilson) or Bertrand McGraw And Company, General Contractor, has seen before. These changes, as it proves, call for lower-quality material, simplified circuitry, or both; this would reduce costs for the electrical subcontractor, Paul Simmons, son-in-law of Bert McGraw, the general contractor, while eliminating the electrical-safety elements in the wiring of the building and rendering it sub-standard. The various characters start to track things down, involving the electrical engineer's office and the Fire Department, represented by Assistant Fire Commissioner Timothy O'Reilly Brown. (Stern reveals that Simmons's company, having been on the verge of financial ruin because of a poorly-bid electrical contract for the World Tower Building, reversed its fortunes beginning with the first of the change orders. His secretary proves not to have destroyed the originals, enabling her to copy them for Giddings.)\nIn the afternoon, the grand-opening celebration for the building commences and the 125th-floor Tower Room is filled with high-profile guests from Congress, the U.N., Hollywood, and the Mayor's office. During the affair, while various authorities are arguing over the change orders and the possibility of evacuating the Tower Room, a disgruntled sheet-metal worker named John Connors, who has no idea of the thimble-rigging of the electrical system that had made it fall short of minimum safety standards, detonates a stolen bomb in the sub-basement transformer room of the giant building in order to disrupt the event and discredit the building and its owners. (Connors had gone over the edge mentally three years before, when his diabetic wife, in the throes of diabetic ketoacidosis, was thrown into the police station \"drunk tank,\" where she was deprived of medication, killing her. The incident had been poorly investigated, and Connors, who had done sheet-metal work on the Tower months before the day of the grand opening, which work had been his last real job, but had been dismissed from it, had sought revenge. He actually got in by bluffing his way past the two police officers guarding the site, who had not received orders to keep people out of it.)\nWhile he had masqueraded as an electrician to bluff his way inside, and most likely did not actually intend to kill anyone in the \"Tower Room,\" Connors is ignorant of the truly high voltages that power the huge building: 13,800 volts from the Consolidated Edison substation. The explosion his stolen bomb triggers not only electrocutes him \"like a piece of bacon,\" but also cripples the transformers designed to reduce the voltage to usable levels and causes fires to erupt throughout the building, disabling the elevators and trapping the guests in the Tower Room on the top floor of the skyscraper. When the doors to the fire stairs are found to be blocked by heavy crates containing radio and television equipment for the antenna mast, a rescue attempt is made by rigging auxiliary power to an express elevator. But this fails as the elevator's single occupant (who sneaked into it prematurely) is killed by the tremendous heat generated by the \"flue effect\" in the building's central core. A breeches buoy line is then shot from a helicopter and rigged to the adjacent World Trade Center's north tower. But the chair device is only partially successful, rescuing all 49 women and but only 28 of the 54 men still in the Tower Room; in the end, many of the people trapped in the World Tower Building die from the effects of the fires.\nStern does not specify the subsequent fate of the remaining World Tower Building structure."

The novel begins with a phone call between Asahi's husband, Muneaki, and his mother, Tomiko. When Muneaki brings up his job transfer, Tomiko offers to let the couple live in the house adjacent to hers, rent free. After a brief discussion, they both agree that the offer is too good to pass up. A quick flashback recounts a dialogue between Asahi and one of her coworkers from the temporary job she quit due to her husband's transfer in which they discuss how little respect they receive as temporary employees. \n\nOn the day of the move, Asahi notes that even though her new town is not that far away from her old one, it feels like an entirely different continent. Asahi's new life as a housewife is marked with boredom and a lack of mobility. Her husband requires the car for his work commute, and there is not much within walking distance besides the local supermarket. She comments on how time has lost its meaning for her. She opens the windows of her home and is overwhelmed by the sound of the cicadas. \nOne afternoon, Asahi gets a call from her mother-in-law Tomiko asking her to deposit money at a nearby 7-Eleven. On her walk to the 7-Eleven, Asahi sees a large black animal which she follows off the path towards a river. Distracted by the sounds of shouting children, she falls in a hole which she is surprised to realize is exactly her size. Sera, Asahi's neighbor whom she had not met before this point, helps Asahi out of the hole and kills a bug that had latched onto Asahi's hand. When Asahi tries to introduce herself, Sera cuts her off, referring to Asahi as \"the bride.\" They parts ways, and when Asahi finally reaches the 7-Eleven, she turns in the money and deposit slip only to realize Tomiko did not put enough money in the envelope, forcing Asahi to take out money at an ATM which is blocked by children. Later that day, Tomiko comes over to repay Asahi for the money she had to take out, but only gives her a fraction of the amount along with some popsicles. Later, when Asahi tries to talk to Muneaki about her encounter with the strange animal, he brushes her off. \u00a0\nThe next morning, Asahi sees the large black animal again. She chases after it, but it disappears around a corner, leading Asahi to Tomiko's backyard where she meets a man who claims to be Muneaki's brother. Asahi notes that he was never mentioned to her by any of his family members. The brother-in-law, who has apparently been living in the backyard shed for twenty years, gives Asahi new information about the black animal, including the fact that it is the creature responsible for digging the holes such as the one Asahi fell into. He is surprised to hear that Asahi has fallen into one of these holes and wants to see where she fell. Upon arriving at the riverbank, Asahi is surprised to see children playing. After having no luck finding the hole, the brother-in-law begins to play with the children as Asahi heads back home. \u00a0\nAsahi and Muneaki spend the holiday of Obon with Asahi's parents before coming back home. Asahi wakes in the middle of the night to see Grandpa heading down the street. She quickly goes outside to follow him, meeting her brother-in-law along the way. They follow Grandpa to the riverbank where he falls into a hole. Asahi drops into a hole next to him. She finds the black animal at the bottom of her hole.

                "description": "The Doll (Polish: Lalka) is the second of four acclaimed novels by the Polish writer Bolesaw Prus (real name Aleksander Gowacki). It was composed for periodical serialization in 18871889 and appeared in book form in 1890. The Doll has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czesaw Miosz, as the greatest Polish novel. According to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society. While The Doll takes its fortuitous title from a minor episode involving a stolen toy, readers commonly assume that it refers to the principal female character, the young aristocrat Izabela cka. Prus had originally intended to name the book Three Generations. ...",

The Doll, covering one and a half years of present time, comprises two parallel narratives.  One opens with events of 1878 and recounts the career of the protagonist, Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski, a man in early middle age.  The other narrative, in the guise of a diary kept by Wokulski's older friend Ignacy Rzecki, takes the reader back to the 1848-49 \"Spring of Nations.\"\nBoles\u0142aw Prus wrote The Doll with such close attention to the physical detail of Warsaw that it was possible, in the Interbellum, to precisely locate the very buildings where, fictively, Wokulski had lived and his store had been located on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie.   Prus thus did for Warsaw's sense of place in The Doll in 1889 what James Joyce was famously to do for his own capital city, Dublin, in the novel Ulysses a third of a century later, in 1922.\nWokulski begins his career as a waiter at Hopfer's, a Warsaw restaurant.  The scion of an impoverished Polish noble family dreams of a life in science.  After taking part in the failed 1863 Uprising against the Russian Empire, he is sentenced to exile in Siberia.  On eventual return to Warsaw, he becomes a salesman at Mincel's haberdashery.  Marrying the late owner's widow (who eventually dies), he comes into money and uses it to set up a partnership with a Russian merchant he had met while in exile.  The two merchants go to Bulgaria during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878, and Wokulski makes a fortune supplying the Russian Army.\nThe enterprising Wokulski now proves a romantic at heart, falling in love with Izabela, daughter of the vacuous, bankrupt aristocrat, Tomasz \u0141\u0119cki.\nThe manager of Wokulski's Warsaw store, Ignacy Rzecki, is a man of an earlier generation, a modest bachelor who lives on memories of his youth, which was a heroic chapter in his own life and that of Europe.  Through his diary the reader learns about some of Wokulski's adventures, seen through the eyes of an admirer.  Rzecki and his friend Katz had gone to Hungary in 1848 to enlist in the revolutionary army.  For Rzecki, the cause of freedom in Europe is connected with the name of Napoleon Bonaparte, and the Hungarian revolution had sparked new hopes of abolishing the reactionary system that had triumphed at Napoleon's fall.  Later he had reposed his hopes in Napoleon III.  Now, as he writes, he places them in Bonaparte's scion, Napoleon III's son, Prince Loulou.  At novel's end, when Rzecki hears that Loulou has perished in Africa, fighting in British ranks against rebel tribesmen, he will be overcome by the despondence of old age.\nFor now, Rzecki lives in constant excitement, preoccupied by politics, which he refers to in his diary by the code-letter \"P.\"  Everywhere in the press he finds indications that a long-awaited \"it\" is beginning.\nIn addition to the two generations represented by Rzecki and Wokulski, the novel provides glimpses of a third, younger one, exemplified in the scientist Julian Ochocki (modeled on Prus' friend, Julian Ochorowicz), some students, and young salesmen at Wokulski's store.  The half-starving students inhabit the garret of an apartment house and are in constant conflict with the landlord over their arrears of rent; they are rebels, are inclined to macabre pranks, and are probably socialists.  Also of socialist persuasion is a young salesman, whereas some of the latter's colleagues believe first and last in personal gain.\nThe Doll's plot focuses on Wokulski's infatuation with the superficial Izabela, who sees him only as a plebeian intruder into her rarefied world, a brute with huge red hands; for her, persons below the social standing of aristocrats are hardly human.\nWokulski, in his quest to win Izabela, begins frequenting theaters and aristocratic salons; and, to help her financially distressed father, founds a company and sets the aristocrats up as shareholders in the business.\nWokulski's eventual downfall highlights The Doll's overarching theme:  the inertia of Polish society.\nWokulski and Rzecki are in many ways alter egos for the book's author.  The frustrated scientist Wokulski is created in Prus' own image.  During a visit to Paris,  Wokulski  meets an old scientist named Geist (whose name is German for \"Spirit\"), who is trying to discover a metal lighter than air; in the hands of those who would use it to organize mankind, it could bring universal peace and happiness. Wokulski is torn between his misplaced, tragic love for Izabela and the idea of settling in Paris and using his fortune to perfect Geist's invention.\nThe Doll, rich in characters and observations from everyday"

The novel begins with a phone call between Asahi's husband, Muneaki, and his mother, Tomiko. When Muneaki brings up his job transfer, Tomiko offers to let the couple live in the house adjacent to hers, rent free. After a brief discussion, they both agree that the offer is too good to pass up. A quick flashback recounts a dialogue between Asahi and one of her coworkers from the temporary job she quit due to her husband's transfer in which they discuss how little respect they receive as temporary employees. \n\nOn the day of the move, Asahi notes that even though her new town is not that far away from her old one, it feels like an entirely different continent. Asahi's new life as a housewife is marked with boredom and a lack of mobility. Her husband requires the car for his work commute, and there is not much within walking distance besides the local supermarket. She comments on how time has lost its meaning for her. She opens the windows of her home and is overwhelmed by the sound of the cicadas. \nOne afternoon, Asahi gets a call from her mother-in-law Tomiko asking her to deposit money at a nearby 7-Eleven. On her walk to the 7-Eleven, Asahi sees a large black animal which she follows off the path towards a river. Distracted by the sounds of shouting children, she falls in a hole which she is surprised to realize is exactly her size. Sera, Asahi's neighbor whom she had not met before this point, helps Asahi out of the hole and kills a bug that had latched onto Asahi's hand. When Asahi tries to introduce herself, Sera cuts her off, referring to Asahi as \"the bride.\" They parts ways, and when Asahi finally reaches the 7-Eleven, she turns in the money and deposit slip only to realize Tomiko did not put enough money in the envelope, forcing Asahi to take out money at an ATM which is blocked by children. Later that day, Tomiko comes over to repay Asahi for the money she had to take out, but only gives her a fraction of the amount along with some popsicles. Later, when Asahi tries to talk to Muneaki about her encounter with the strange animal, he brushes her off. \u00a0\nThe next morning, Asahi sees the large black animal again. She chases after it, but it disappears around a corner, leading Asahi to Tomiko's backyard where she meets a man who claims to be Muneaki's brother. Asahi notes that he was never mentioned to her by any of his family members. The brother-in-law, who has apparently been living in the backyard shed for twenty years, gives Asahi new information about the black animal, including the fact that it is the creature responsible for digging the holes such as the one Asahi fell into. He is surprised to hear that Asahi has fallen into one of these holes and wants to see where she fell. Upon arriving at the riverbank, Asahi is surprised to see children playing. After having no luck finding the hole, the brother-in-law begins to play with the children as Asahi heads back home. \u00a0\nAsahi and Muneaki spend the holiday of Obon with Asahi's parents before coming back home.

Der Nachsommer (English: Indian Summer; subtitled A Tale; 1857) is a novel in three volumes by Adalbert Stifter. A 19th century Bildungsroman that describes the journey of an idealistic, sheltered young man from childhood to maturity, it combines aspects of Biedermeier thought with elements of German humanism to create what is generally considered to be a great work of German bourgeois realism.\nAccording to the English translator of Der Nachsommer, Wendell Frye, the novel \"presents an ideal world, in contrast to what Adalbert Stifter saw to be a degenerating period.\"  He goes on to explain that in this novel \"the reader finds one of the most complete statements of the 'Humanit\u00e4tsideal' [ideal of humanity]: the young geologist becomes totally immersed in traditional values and culture, thereby becoming a more complete and fulfilled human being.\"\nJames Sheehan writes, \"Heinrich's Bildung is a gradual, indirect process; he does not learn by confronting crises or dramatic events (of which Stifter's plot is totally devoid), nor does he gain much implicit instruction from Risach.  Instead, the hero is slowly absorbed into Rosenhaus and the social and moral order it represents.  Eventually, he sees that, just as Rosenhaus's beauty comes from its integration into its natural setting, so Risach's moral strength comes from his harmonious relationship to the external world.  In art and in life, one must seek to avoid the dislocations that can be caused by unbridled passions and excessive spontaneity.\"\nAs Christine Oertel Sj\u00f6gren notes, in her discussion of the importance of light to the novel, Der Nachsommer is not one-dimensional.  In fact, \"while Heinrich's attainment of full and perfect manhood is the goal of the action, death, the extreme form of solitude, is also woven into the world of Der Nachsommer, for awareness of death is essential to maturity.  The malignant forces in nature and the insignificance of man in the face of the universe are problems not ignored in the novel.  The threat of annihilation has here, however, no final dominion over the man with a capacity for love.\"\nMilan Kundera discusses Der Nachsommer in his non-fiction book The Curtain. He describes it thus: \"I wonder who first discovered the existential significance of bureaucracy. Probably Adalbert Stifter.\" and goes on to describe the section of the novel where Risach explains his office of a civil servant that he had to leave. \"His break with bureaucracy is one of the memorable breaks of mankind from the modern world. A break both radical and peaceable, as befits the idyllic atmosphere of that strange novel from the Biedermeier period.\"\nJames Sheehan also writes that \"Stifter's style seems to replicate the moral lesson he wants his hero\u2014and his readers\u2014to learn; he writes without passion or spontaneity, self-consciously submitting to the material he describes, depicting in painstaking detail the cohesive universe of which he wishes us to be a part.\"\nThe excessive detail, for which Stifter's contemporary Christian Friedrich Hebbel famously derided the novel, is, according to Christine Oertel Sj\u00f6gren, \"precisely a source of fascination for modern scholars, who seize upon the number of objects as the distinguishing characteristic of this novel and accord it high esteem because of the very significance of the 'things' in it.  Far from being extraneous elements, as Hebbel regarded them, the art and nature objects provide a rich setting of beauty and a mirror-background to the human story in the foreground.\"\nOn Friedrich Nietzsche's appreciation for the book, Burkhard Meyer-Sickendiek notes that \"it is only Stifter's novel that Nietzsche will mention again in one breath with Goethe: 'I have,' Nietzsche writes in October 1888, 'absorbed Adalbert Stifter's Der Nachsommer with deep affection: in fact, it is the only German book after Goethe that has any magic for me.'\"\nThe manuscript of the work was acquired by the Bavarian State Library in 1964.\nFrye, Wendell, Indian Summer, New York: Peter Lang, 1985. p. 5\nSheehan, James J.

The story starts with Prince Charles entertaining some bored children at Balmoral. He tells them about an old man who, in search of peace and quiet (and a hot spring bath), has made his way to a remote cave at Lochnagar. He comes across a cave and, dragging a bathtub inside, claims the place as his own. The old man makes a lot of noise and mentions that his neighbours used to complain about the banging and noise coming from his home late at night. He chats to an animal he names Maudie, the original occupant of the cave, while setting up the apparatus for running his long awaited bath.\nFinally, all is ready and the Old Man appears in his tartan dressing gown, ready to step into the bath. But, as he jumps in, he realises that the water is freezing and his squeals echo round the loch. He tells Maudie that he will have to wait for a bath until he has found a way of heating the water, and pulls the plug on his full bath.\nUnknown to the Old Man, his cave is near the underground home of the Gorm, a clan of Scottish pixies, who are responsible for pushing up the spring flowers in Scotland. The Gorm King is an inventor, and has created a curious device (which looks and sounds like a set of bagpipes) which reduces full grown flowers back to seeds. The seed will turn back into a flower when it gets wet and the Gorm Queen and Princess declare that the King has changed the way everyone will work from now on. However, as they are discussing this, a flood pours down unexpectedly from above. When the Old Man emptied his bath, the water followed his complicated arrangements of pipes and into the Gorm's underground workshops, ruining the flowers and flooding out the workers. The Princess and her younger brother end up being washed away from their parents and come out of a tree stump alone and wet. They look up to find a 'giant', tending to a huge pot over a roaring fire and the young Prince fears that they will be made into soup.\nIn fact the 'giant' is the Old Man, who has found a way to heat his bath by lighting a huge fire underneath it. As he waits, still in his tartan dressing gown, he is suddenly hit by the Gorm King's device, which has been picked up by the young Princess. He immediately shrinks to the size of a pixie and is taken away by the Prince and Princess, to see what his bathwater has done to their home. At first, he thinks he is having a strange dream, and so he appears callously unconcerned at the devastation, stating only that \"I've never dreamed in colour before\". This delusion lasts until he falls down a hole, hitting his head. As he exclaims at the pain in his head, it dawns on the Old Man that since you can't feel pain in a dream, what he's seen must be real and the damage is his fault.\nThe Prince and Princess take the Old Man back outside but, to their shock, the whole world seems to be on fire. The fire underneath the Old Man's bath has spread and is threatening the countryside. The Old Man offers to help, but he needs to be bigger before he can do anything. The Princess is reluctant to help the Old Man, but she relents and tells him that he needs to 'get watered'. With the help of Maudie, the Old Man is catapulted into his bath and returns to normal size. He pulls the plug again, flooding the area and putting out the fire, while protecting the pixies' underground home from further damage.\nThe Old Man has learned that his actions affect others and that he must think of the consequences. The story ends with the Gorm sharing a huge bath with the Old Man, complete with water wheels and boats. When he is finished, the Old Man drains his bath using more of his special plumbing skills to reuse the water to reactivate the magic seeds and causing flowers to pop up all around.\nThe story closes on the Old Man of Lochnagar and returns to Balmoral and Prince Charles. The children tell him that it was a good story, but that's all, just a story. Charles replies that you never really know, and lifts a set of bagpipes from his desk and begins to play. After a few notes, the Prince is affected in the same way as the Old Man, shrinking to a tiny size and suggesting that his story was inspired by true events. The children he has been entertaining then race off through the house to find the bathtub, to restore the Prince to his rightful size.\nThe Gorm, meaning \"Blue\", may have been inspired by \"Na Fir Ghorma\", the Blue Men, a tribe of faeries reputed to live in The Minch or similar folklore stories. The same idea of blue-skinned fairy folk is also to be seen in The Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett.\n\"The Old Man of Lochnagar\". AbeBooks. Retrieved 12 August"

The opening chapters of Dirty White Boys articulately sets an impressionable tone for the remainder of the novel, as the story's main antagonist, Lamar Pye, a physically powerful, charismatic, aggressive, and intelligent \"alpha male\" in his late thirties, uses brutal violence to avoid being raped by a giant black inmate in the showers at McAlester State Penitentiary (the Mac). Despite his position as a \"Prince\" (a ranking prisoner) amongst the Dirty White Boys, a white gang element of the prisoner populace, the rape was ordered as revenge for a slight made by Lamar's retarded, behemoth cousin Odell against the white gang chief. After his sale to the black inmate gang, Lamar knows that the revenge is inevitable if he remains in the prison. Richard, Lamar's failed artist cell mate, a timid man imprisoned for the gruesome murder of his own mother, joins Lamar as he uses his quick wit and unrestrained capacity for violence to abscond \"the Mac\" with Odell.\nBud Pewtie, the novel's main protagonist, is a State Trooper called to participate in the search for the escaped criminals. He is initially portrayed as a responsible father with two teenage boys, but it quickly emerges that he is having an affair with the young wife of his partner, Ted, a confused young man with unarticulated doubts about his role as a trooper. The troopers are briefed about the escape by the embittered alcoholic Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation Lieutenant C. D. Henderson, a once star law enforcement officer who once served with Earl Swagger as a detective. A series of tips leads the troopers to the remote farmhouse of an old couple, where the Pyes and Richard have taken refuge, arming themselves with the old man's firearms. An ambush by the Pyes ensues, with Pewtie and Ted ducking for cover. While Pewtie performs distinctly well under fire of the Pyes, Ted caves under the pressure of the assault. As a result, Pewtie is severely wounded and left for dead by Lamar, and watches in horror as Lamar brutally executes his helpless partner.\nThe Pyes escape but Pewtie survives having been unknowingly shot by Lamar with lightweight bird hunting shot. The Pyes flee to the remote house of a mentally ill young woman, Ruta Beth Tull, who has been writing confused letters to Richard about their \"mystic connection\". Tull, it later emerges, murdered her own parents as a juvenile and sees this as her link to Richard. Tull immediately takes to Lamar and the group forms into a twisted family unit as the search for them loses momentum. Pewtie returns to the house where he was ambushed to thank the owner, who also survived being kidnapped by Lamar and raised the alarm about the shootout. While at the house he is given pictures of lions drawn by Richard, and overlooked by investigators, as Richard's value to Lamar rests on his ability to draw pictures as Lamar orders him to; Lamar being amused and intrigued by the artist's ability. Pewtie also returns to his affair with his dead partner's wife Holly and frustrations at the conflicting demands of his newfound romance and his family life continue to build.\nLamar and his \"family\" carry out a bloody robbery of a restaurant in a small Texas town from which Lamar narrowly escapes with his life. The bloodshed of the robbery intensifies the manhunt for Lamar and Pewtie is one of the officers who drops by the scene of the crime. There he finds more pictures of lions drawn by Richard at the restaurant. He is questioned by a suspicious LT Henderson about his find but does not explain it or the earlier pictures. Lamar now reveals to his family that Richard has in fact been working on the design for a tattoo and they begin a search for a top quality tattoo artist to carry out the work and finding Jimmy Ky outside a small town. After discussing the drawings with a local art teacher Bud also begins to suspect that Lamar is working on a tattoo, and obtains information about Jimmy Ky. The stage is now set for the second bloody confrontation between Bud Pewtie and Lamar. Pewtie literally stumbles in as Lamar is being tattooed and watched over by Odell. A gunfight ensues which ends with Pewtie killing Odell in a gun battle that only ends after Bud expends all his ammunition from his 3 handguns into Odell and blasting two fingers off Lamar's left hand. Pewtie himself is once again badly injured and Lamar escapes after the intervention of Richard and Ruta.\nAs Bud struggles with his choices Lamar plots a terrible revenge for the death of his cousin.\nThe stage is set for the final confrontation between Pewtie and Lamar. Pewtie fails at first to shoot Lamar with a rifle, his bullet deflected just enough by an unseen glass door to miss"

Michael Martin Plunkett is a child genius who comes from a broken home: His father is a hustler and his mother is an alcoholic and drug addict who engages in a series of one-night stands. After his parents divorce, Plunkett takes solace in a series of disturbing fantasies in which he re-assembles his classmates' body parts. The fantasies lead Plunkett to becoming a peeping Tom, and from the time he is seven until he turns eleven, he spends all of his free time spying on his neighbors and observing people having intercourse. Before he can graduate junior high, Plunkett's teachers, having noticed his withdrawn nature in class, send him to the school psychologist, who identifies Plunkett as disturbed but nonetheless passes him to high school after Plunkett emotionally manipulates him into a fit of rage.\nIn high school, Plunkett, now realizing that there is something different about himself after his session with the school psychologist, seeks out some means of grounding himself psychologically. He becomes obsessed with a series of comic books and fixates on the main villain, \"Shroud Shifter,\" a jewel thief obsessed with becoming invisible. Plunkett comes to the conclusion that his own goal should become \"invisibility\" in the sense that he can move through life as nondescript as possible.\nPlunkett steals from his mother to finance a series of wardrobes which will allow him to blend in with as diverse a number of people as possible; she punishes him, and in retribution, he switches her muscle relaxers with massive quantities of amphetamines. She suffers a psychotic break and slits her wrists; Plunkett drinks her blood and then calls an ambulance, reporting the suicide. He is placed in the foster care of an LAPD officer, whom Plunkett sets about manipulating in order to gain knowledge of how to become a good criminal. He begins committing a series of fetishistic burglaries in which he breaks into women's homes, kills their pets, and steals from them after watching them engage in intercourse.\nFollowing the Tate/LaBianca Murders, Plunkett attempts to meet Charles Manson, only to improperly identify a generic hippie as Manson and break into an apartment where he is having sex. The hippie apprehends Plunkett, and Plunkett is sentenced to a year in prison.\nIn prison, Plunkett works to perfect his body while studying under other criminals and learning their techniques. Doing janitorial work as a trusty, he encounters the recently incarcerated Manson; furious that the rambling, barely coherent Manson is being held up as a paragon of evil, Plunkett resolves that upon his release he will become the kind of killer truly worthy of that distinction.\nUpon his release from prison, Plunkett delves further into his fantasy life, which begins to spill over into his waking life as Shroud Shifter appears to him in a series of schizophrenic visions, encouraging him to commit more violent crimes. Finally, one night, Plunkett abruptly lashes out and kills a girl and her boyfriend who had invited him to their apartment to smoke marijuana. Plunkett successfully covers up his crime by making the murder appear to be the work of drug dealers; now fully entrenched in a version of his fantasy life that overlaps with reality, Plunkett embarks on a road trip across the western United States, picking up hitch hikers and brutally mutilating and murdering them, then selling their belongings to fences to finance his lifestyle.\nAs time progresses and his body count rises, Plunkett perfects his techniques, outfitting a Dodge van with a series of hidden compartments and living amenities so that it can act as both his mobile home and murder factory.\nAfter hastily killing a man in the snow, Plunkett is apprehended by Wisconsin State Police Sergeant Ross Anderson, who reveals himself to be a serial killer responsible for three (later seven) brutal rape/murders of young coeds. Anderson and Plunkett become romantically involved and Anderson uses his influence to protect Plunkett as his own murders increase in number and brutality.\nFBI agent Thomas Dusenberg is tasked with identifying and apprehending Anderson and Plunkett. He eventually captures Anderson, who gives up Plunkett in exchange for immunity from the death penalty. After Plunkett sees his own photo on wanted posters, he reasons\u2014using a chain of paranoid logic\u2014that Anderson's family identified him as a serial killer. Plunkett goes to Anderson's house, where he violently mutilates and murders his entire family. In the course of killing the last"

The Sons of Avalon Saga is a series of Arthurian Legend novels, by American novelist, Dee Marie. The first book in the series, Sons of Avalon, Merlin\u2019s Prophecy, begins with the birth of Merlin, and ends with the conception of King Arthur. Future books in the series explore the birth and life of King Arthur and his court.\nMerlin: Son of the Lady of the Lake (his father unknown). He was fostered by Sir Arden and Lady Enid in a small village in Wales. As a boy prophet, he advised four High Kings: Vortigern, Ambrosius, Uther, and later Arthur. He was the sworn protector of Britain and manipulated the birth of Arthur, and became infatuated with the nymph, Nimue.\nSir Lot: Prince, and later king, of the Isles of Orkney. He was the leader of the Young Royal Guard. Sir Lot was an ally to Uther, and adversary to Merlin. He served three High Kings: Vortigern, Ambrosius, and Uther.\nAmbrosius: Son of High King Constantine, and middle brother of Constans and Uther. At the age of five, Ambrosius and his younger brother, Uther, were raised, in Brittany, by their cousin, King Budic I. When the brothers reached their early twenties, they regained their rightful place on the throne of Britain. Ambrosius became High King of Britain after Vortigern\u2019s reign. Merlin was Ambrosius\u2019 prophet, advisor, and prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nUther: Son of High King Constantine, and youngest brother of Constans and Ambrosius. At the age of four, he and his brother, Ambrosius, were raised, in Brittany by their cousin, King Budic I, until they reached their early twenties. He followed his younger brother Ambrosius, as Britain\u2019s High King. Merlin was Uther\u2019s prophet of war, and rival for his brother\u2019s attentions. Uther was infatuated with Igraine, the wife of Duke Gorlois, and later father a child, Arthur, with Igraine.\n\u201cI greatly enjoyed Sons of Avalon, Merlin's Prophecy, by Dee Marie, an Arthurian novel concerning the early days of Merlin,\u201d Martin Millar, (author of \u201cThe Good Fairies of New York\u201d and \u201cThe Werewolf Girl\u201d) Oct. 2008.\n\u201cDee Marie knows her history and her legends well. Her novel, Sons of Avalon, Merlin's Prophecy, is a fresh, new interruption of the Arthurian Story.\u201d Michael J. Sullivan, (author of \"The Riyria Revelations\") March, 2009\n\u201cIn Sons of Avalon, Merlin\u2019s Prophecy, Dee Marie creates the beginnings of an epic series. Marie\u2019s writing is reminiscent in voice and style to Ken Follett\u2019s World Without End and Pillars of the Earth.\u201d Todd A. Fonseca (author of \u201cThe Time Cavern\u201d) May, 2009\n\u201cStunningly beautiful prose, breathtaking descriptions and investable heroes. It doesn't get much better than this.

It tells the tragic story of two young people in love. Mem, a young Kurdish boy of the \"Alan\" clan and heir to the City of the West, who falls in love with Zin, of the \"Botan\" clan and the daughter of the governor of Botan. Their union is blocked by Bakr of the Bakran clan, who is Mem\u2019s antagonist throughout the story and is jealous of the two star-crossed lovers. Mem eventually dies during a complicated conspiracy by Bakr. When Zin receives the news, she collapses and dies while mourning the death of Mem at his grave. The immense grief leads to her death and she is buried next to Mem in Cizre. The news of the death of Mem and Zin spreads quickly among the people of Jazira Botan. When Bakr's (Beko) role in the tragedy is revealed, Tacd\u00een, the best friend of Mem, kills him. Bakr (Beko) will be buried next to Mem and Zin's graves. Because before dying, Z\u00een gives his testimony and says that \"It was because of Beko that we could not come together, so I want him to witness our love, If he dies, bury him next to me and Mem\". However, a thorn bush, nourished by the blood of Bakr, grows out of his grave: the roots of malice penetrate deep into the earth among the lovers\u2019 graves, thus separating the two even in death.\nOf all variations, the work of Ahmad Khani is the best known.

Julie of the Wolves is a children's novel by Jean Craighead George, published by Harper in 1972 with illustrations by John Schoenherr. Set on the Alaska North Slope, it features a young Inuk girl experiencing the changes forced upon her culture from outside. George wrote two sequels that were originally illustrated by Wendell Minor: Julie (1994), which starts 10 minutes after the first book ends, and Julie's Wolf Pack (1997), which is told from the viewpoint of the wolves.\nIn 1971, Jean Craighead George and her son Luke went on a trip to Barrow, Alaska, to do research on wolves for an article for Reader's Digest. As they flew into the Barrow airport, she and her son spotted a young Inuk girl on the tundra, whom her son said \"looked awfully little to be out there by herself\".\nAt the Barrow Arctic Research Lab, George observed scientists who were studying wolves and attempting to break their communication code. She allegedly witnessed a man bite the wolf on the top of its nose and communicate with it in soft whimpers, and \"the incident stayed with George\". George herself successfully communicated with a female wolf. Upon remembering the Inuk girl walking by herself on the tundra that she and her son Luke saw on their way to Barrow, she decided to write a book about a young girl surviving on her own in the tundra by communicating with wolves. The character of Miyax/Julie is based on an Inuk woman named Julia Sebevan, who taught George \"about the old ways of the Inuits [sic]\".\nIn the process of writing the novel, George went through three drafts, and used numerous titles including \"The Voice of the Wolf\"; \"Wolf! Wolf?\"; \"Wolf Girl\"; \"The Cry of the Wolf\"; and \"Wolf Song\".\nReaders and students communicated to George their desire to read more about Julie \"several years ago\", but George felt that she \"did not know enough about the Eskimo culture\". It was only after her son, Craig, moved to Alaska that George \"felt ready\" to write the sequel Julie. Julie's Wolf Pack was written only after George had learned more about the relationships of wolves in a pack.\nThe story has three parts: first her present situation (Amaroq, the Wolf), then a flashback (Miyax, the Girl), and finally a return to the present (Kapugen, the Hunter).\nThe book was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1973, and was a nominee under the Children's Books category in the 1973 National Book Awards. Mary Ellen Halvorson describes the book as \"uniquely sensitive\" and \"wonderfully educational\" in a review for The Prescott Courier. The book also won the 1975 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis.In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1966 to 1975, children's author John Rowe Townsend wrote, \"The details of the girl's relationship with the wolves are totally absorbing, but as a story the book seems to me to be slightly deficient.\"\nThe inclusion of Julie of the Wolves in elementary school reading lists has been challenged several times due to parental concerns regarding the attempted rape of the main character. One of these incidents occurred in March 1996, when the book was removed from the sixth grade reading list in Pulaski Township, Pennsylvania, at the behest of parents who \"complained of a graphic marital rape scene in the book\". It is number 32 on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990\u20131999. The book has additionally been criticized for its stereotypical depiction of Inuit culture.\n1972, USA, Harper and Row, ISBN\u00a00-06-021943-2, Pub date 1972, Hardcover\n1974, USA, HarperCollins, ISBN\u00a00-06-440058-1, Pub date February 10, 1974, Paperback\n1985, USA, HarperTrophy ISBN\u00a00-06-021943-2, Pub date 1985, Paperback\n1977, Canada, Fitzhenry & Whiteside, 0-88-902374-3, Pub date 1977, Paperback\n1997, USA, HarperTrophy ISBN\u00a00-06-440058-1, Pub date June 6, 1997, Paperback\n2003, USA, HarperTeen ISBN\u00a00-06-054095-8, Pub date September 16, 2003, Paperback\nSince its first publication, Julie of the Wolves has also been published in at least thirteen other languages, including Spanish, French, Arabic, Turkish, Chinese, and Japanese.\nJulie of the Wolves has been adapted into a musical play, directed by Peter Dalto and written by Barbara Dana, with music by Chris Kubie and choreography by Fay Simpson.

It is based on his experience as a Parisian expatriate in the early 1930s, when he and Alfred Perls shared a small apartment in suburban Clichy as struggling writers (at 4 Avenue Anatole-France). It takes place around the time Miller was writing Black Spring. According to his photographer friend George Brassa, Miller admitted the title is completely misleading.",

The plot follows Joey, an American expatriate in and around Place Clichy. The book is divided in two parts. In the first, Joey and his equally destitute roommate Carl search for food and navigate relationships with various women. Chiefly, Joey with Nys, a prostitute he meets at the Caf\u00e9 Wepler near Montmartre, and Carl with Colette, a fifteen-year-old runaway who moves in with them before eventually being retrieved by her parents.\nThe second half, \u201cMara-Marignon,\u201d describes Carl's volatile love affair with the married Eliane, and Joey's relationship with Mara, a prostitute he meets on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Mara reminds Joey of a previous lover, the married Christine, whom he regrets not marrying himself. This leads to a recollection of an evening he and Carl spent at their home with an acrobat named Corinne and a Danish woman named Christine. The four of them have a spontaneous orgy, which upsets Christine, who is laughed at by the other three.\nThe thin volume was initially written in New York shortly after Miller's return from Paris in 1940, and revised in Big Sur in 1956, while he was working on Nexus. The book was first published in France by Olympia Press in 1956. Following Miller's victory in the obscenity trial for Tropic of Cancer, Quiet Days in Clichy was finally published in the United States by Grove Press in 1965.\nThe novella has twice been made into a feature film. The 1970 version was a Danish production, written and directed by Jens J\u00f8rgen Thorsen, and featuring a soundtrack by Country Joe McDonald.\nThe second film, Quiet Days in Clichy (1990 film), mostly in English with some bits of French, was released in 1990. It was directed by Claude Chabrol and starred Andrew McCarthy as Miller. McCarthy was 26 years old when he played Miller, who is in his early 40s in the book. Chabrol deemed the film a not-too-faithful rendering of the novella.\nIn an HBO anthology series based on American literature, Women & Men 2: In Love There Are No Rules (1991), one of the shorts is \u201cMara,\u201d based on the second half of Quiet Days in Clichy. The 30-minute film was directed by Mike Figgis.

The ten short stories in the book are:\nThe Fourteenth Ward\nA Saturday Afternoon\nThird or Fourth Day of Spring\nThe Angel is My Watermark!\nThe Tailor Shop\nJabberwhorl Cronstadt\nInto the Night Life\nWalking Up and Down\nBurlesk\nMegalopolitan Maniac\nBlack Spring was published by Obelisk Press in Paris in 1936 but not published in the United States until 1963 due to obscenity laws.  When the Grove Press \u201cBlack Cat\u201d edition was released, several of the stories not considered obscene had already been published in other Miller volumes such as The Cosmological Eye, published by New Directions. Several other stories had been published in New Directions\u2019 annual, New Directions in Prose and Poetry.\nMiller, like his critics, had a high opinion of the book. In a 1949 recording, Miller says:\nDuring the ten years I spent in Paris, I must have written seven or eight books. This one, Black Spring, I like the best of all I wrote during that period. It was a wonderful period of my life. The years 1932 and \u20193, living outside Paris in the town of Clichy, where I wrote the book, I guess were the very best years of my whole life. \nIn The Books in My Life, after quoting the epigraph to Black Spring taken from Miguel de Unamuno, which reads\nCan I be as I believe myself or as others believe me to be? Here is where these lines become confession in the presence of my unknown and unknowable me, unknown and unknowable for myself. Here is where I create the legend wherein I must bury myself,\nMiller goes on to write, \u201cThese lines appear in the fly-leaf to Black Spring, a book which came nearer to being myself, I believe, than any book I have written before or since.\u201d\nThe book Henry Miller on Writing includes a handwritten list of \u201ccommandments\u201d (labeled \u201cWork Schedule, 1932-33\u201d) which hung above Miller\u2019s desk with the second commandment being \u201cStart no more new books, add no more new material to \u2018Black Spring.\u2019\u201d\nOne of the notable aspects of the book is that each story (with the exception of \u201cThe Angel is My Watermark!\u201d) begins with an epigraph taken from the respective story which to varying degrees sums up a major theme of the story.  The epigraph for \u201cThe Tailor Shop\" contains the phrase \u201calways merry and bright,\u201d which would become the title of Jay Martin's unauthorized biography of Miller.  The epigraph for \u201cInto the Night Life\u2026\u201d \u2014being \u201cA Coney Island of the Mind\u201d\u2014became the title of a volume of poetry by Lawrence Ferlinghetti.\nMiller, Henry (1963).

In reality, the Inca King (Ataulpa) at one time was held for ransom by the Spaniards. However, llamas were not a part of the ransom, and the form of the gold was primarily solid, not gold dust.\nThemes of Secret of the Andes include racial identity, preservation of historical cultures, adoption, animal guides, royal lineage, and the Spanish conquest and betrayal of the Incan Empire.\nE.

Secret of the Andes is a children's novel by Ann Nolan Clark. It won the 1953 Newbery Medal.\nSecret of the Andes is historical fiction. Some events were inspired by real events in history. In reality, the Inca King (Ataulpa) at one time was held for ransom by the Spaniards. However, llamas were not a part of the ransom, and the form of the gold was primarily solid, not gold dust.\nThemes of Secret of the Andes include racial identity, preservation of historical cultures, adoption, animal guides, royal lineage, and the Spanish conquest and betrayal of the Incan Empire.\nE. B. White's Charlotte's Web was a runner-up for the Newbery Medal the year Secret of the Andes won the award.  According to a 2008 article by children's literature expert Anita Silvey in the School Library Journal, one member of the Newbery committee stated that she voted for Secret of the Andes rather than Charlotte's Web \"because she hadn't seen any good books about South America.\"  Silvey further commented, \"The Secret of the Andes is a good book; Charlotte's Web, the best.\"\nNewbery Award & Honor Winners: 1953 Winner & Honorees\nClark, Ann (1976).

Scarecrow and the Army of Thieves is an action thriller novel released on 12 October 2011 by Australian author Matthew Reilly. It is the latest installment in the Shane Schofield series.\nOn 24 December 2010, Reilly announced his fifth Scarecrow novel stating: \nThe first draft is finished, done, dusted. And I can confidently say that this is easily the fastest Scarecrow book yet. It is also considerably more violent than any of my previous books. This sort of crept up on me (and I was the guy writing the book!), but as my readers will know, in my books, death has to be something to be feared. It has to be horrible, grisly, and, well, violent. And the Army of Thieves aren't a very nice bunch of guys, so death at their hands will be very nasty indeed...\nOne month before the official release, Reilly's publisher released a video trailer for the book.\nShane \"Scarecrow\" Schofield\nA brilliant Marine Captain who is considered broken from the bounty hunt in the book Scarecrow after his girlfriend, Elizabeth \"Fox\" Gant, was killed. He is still recovering and has a USA $2,000,000 bounty on him from the French Government. He is working up in the North Pole with a DARPA team testing out new inventions along with his trusted friend Mother and two other Marines. He is constantly tormented by Marius Calderon over the death of Gant and a side story is him trying to cope with the loss.\nGena \"Mother\" Newman\nA friend of Schofield's who knows him better than most people as she has been with him since before the events in Ice Station. She tries to help Schofield get through Gant's death, which is also causing a strain in her marriage. Mother meets her perfect match and the two grow close.\nDavid Fairfax\nA geeky  cryptanalyst working with the DIA who helps Schofield by obtaining information to help with the mission. Schofield and Fairfax are good friends who Schofield stays in contact with for most of the book. Fairfax saves a woman from being kidnapped by several members of the Army of Thieves and they work on trying to find out why the Army of Thieves is on Dragon Island.\nVeronique \"Renard\" Champion\nChampion, the cousin of Luc Champion who was killed during the events in Ice Station, is a French woman Schofield meets during a failed assassination attempt, is trying to avenge her cousin's, which she blames on Schofield. During the novel's events, Schofield and Champion grow close and by the end, it is possible they have started a relationship together. It is revealed that Renard is French for fox (Libby Gant, Schofield's girlfriend killed in Scarecrow, has the callsign \"Fox\").\nJean-Claude Francois Michel \"Le Barbarian/Baba\" Huguenot\nMother's perfect match who is part of the French assassination attempt on Schofield due to the bounty on him. Mother and Baba share many similarities and they work closely together during the mission. Mother is offered the chance to be with Baba but in the end, she decides to stay with her husband.\nMarius Calderon\nA CIA agent who theorised that China will become more powerful than the U.S. almost three decades before it did. He is the leader of the Army of Thieves who uses Psychological warfare against Schofield, going as far as to taunt Schofield over the loss of Gant. Calderon even makes Schofield watch as he presumably kills Mother and Baba for no reason than for him to just see it happen. Schofield was informed that Calderon died, which is later found to be false when he leaves Schofield's anti-flash glasses that he took earlier and left them on his bed.\nAdamski, Kat (14 April 2011). \"Time travelling car takes Matt back to the 80s\".

A murder occurs under embarrassing circumstances, and Leonidas forms a motley crew of assistants together in order to track down clues, chase around the town, and solve the mystery.  There is a strong vein of humor and the plot is fast-moving.\nThe adventures of Leonidas Witherall were a short-lived radio series at about the time of this novel.  In the novels, Witherall is also the author of a radio series about the adventures of stalwart Lieutenant Hazeltine.  Some supporting characters, such as Margie and Cuff from this novel, are found in others as well."

The book deal was announced in May 2009 when Palin was still Governor of Alaska. She said that she wanted the public to hear her true story, \"unrestrained and unfiltered\". She reportedly received an advance of $1.25 million from publisher Harper Collins, with two projected additional payouts of between $2.5 million and $5 million each.\nPalin announced that although she would have a ghostwriter to help, she would be doing a lot of the writing herself, employing her journalism skills and the personal diaries and notes that she had kept throughout her life. Critics questioned whether Palin could write a book.\nResponding to concerns that writing and promoting the book would interfere with her duties as governor, Palin said she would only work on the book after hours and would promote the book \"schedule permitting\". The Alaska law department issued a legal opinion which okayed the project, stating: \"A book publication project is compatible with your position as governor so long as it does not interfere with your official duties\".\nConservative journalist and author Lynn Vincent worked on the book with Palin for several weeks shortly after she resigned the governorship in the summer of 2009. Palin met with HarperCollins editors for intensive editing sessions in New York City. HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham said that Palin had been \"unbelievably conscientious and hands-on at every stage\", adding that the book was \"her words, her life ... in full and fascinating detail\". HarperCollins had planned publication for spring 2010, but later moved the date to November 17, 2009, as the book was completed earlier than expected. The publisher attributed completion of the memoir early to Palin's devoting full-time to the writing process after she left office. A paperback version of the book, with new material, released on August 24, 2010.\nThe first part of the book is devoted to Palin's life before the 2008 campaign; the second part details her life as a candidate for national office. The book is written in a personal tone similar to Palin's manner of speaking. Palin discusses the disagreements she had with campaign advisers of her running mate John McCain, criticizes the national media, and talks about the importance of religion and family life.\nThe \"Going Rogue\" part of the title refers to criticism leveled at Palin by McCain campaign advisers that she was straying from their carefully crafted message and publicly disagreeing with McCain on several issues. The subtitle, \"An American Life\", mirrors the title of President Ronald Reagan's 1990 autobiography.\nPalin ends the book by quoting her own father saying, \"Sarah's not retreating, she's reloading.\", suggesting she would return to public life.\nThe book was available for pre-order between $9 and $10 during a price war among online retailers Amazon, Target.com, and Walmart.com. Dan Calabrese, writing in the North Star National, called the sales \"an absolutely unprecedented performance for a non-fiction book so far in advance of its release date\".\nLess than two weeks after its release, sales of the book exceeded the one million mark, putting it in a class with memoirs by Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The print run was extended to 2.8 million copies from 1.5 million. Going Rogue attained sales of over 2.7 million by December 1, 2009, and was number one on The New York Times Best Seller list for six consecutive weeks. As of January 21, 2010, it was #4 on the New York Times best seller list after 9 weeks in the Top 10.\nAccording to campaign records, late in 2009, Palin used $63,000 of donations from SarahPAC, her political action committee, to purchase copies of her book, \"Going Rogue\". The expenditures were listed as, \"books for fundraising donor fulfillment\". Meghan Stapleton, Palin's spokeswoman, stated the purchased books were autographed and awarded to donors contributing more than $100 to Palin's PAC.\nA team of eleven reporters for the Associated Press challenged some of Palin's statements as factually incorrect, such as her assertions that she traveled frugally, avoided large campaign donors, was against the Wall Street bailouts of 2008, and entered politics for purely altruistic reasons. Their analysis concluded by speculating that the book was \"a pre-campaign manifesto\"."

The book, released by OR Books, a start-up founded by veteran publishers John G. H. Oakes and Colin Robinson, was published on November 17, 2009, the same day that Palin's own hardback Going Rogue: An American Life was released. According to their site, Oakes is the former publisher of the independent publishing house Four Walls Eight Windows, and Robinson a former publisher of The New Press.\nOther contributing writers include Max Blumenthal, Joe Conason, Eve Ensler, Michelle Goldberg, Jane Hamsher, Christopher Hayes, Jim Hightower, Linda Hirshman, Dahlia Lithwick, Amanda Marcotte, Shannyn Moore, Jeanne Devon, John Nichols, Hanna Rosin, Matt Taibbi, Michael Tomasky, Rebecca Traister, Naomi Klein, Jessica Valenti, Patricia Williams, JoAnn Wypijewski, and Gary Younge.\nSalon magazine also announced that several of their original articles will be included: \"The Sarah Palin Pity Party,\" by Rebecca Traister; \"The Losers Who Gave Us Sarah Palin,\" by Joe Conason; and two pieces by Juan Cole, \"What's the Difference Between Sarah Palin and Muslim Fundamentalists? Lipstick\" and \"Sarah Palin, meet Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\" Some of the other more than 50 short essays, includes \"Wrong Woman, Wrong Message,\" by Gloria Steinem, \"Our Polar Bears, Ourselves,\" by Mark Hertsgaard, and \"Sarah Palin's Death Panels\" by Robert Reich. Max Blumenthal, author of Republican Gomorrah (2009), includes an account of his meeting with Palin's \"witch-hunting pastor\" from Kenya, Thomas Muthee, \"who urges his parishioners to crush 'the python spirit' of the unbeliever enemies by stomping on their necks.\"\nAn additional component in Going Rouge is how \"feminist considerations\" were \"magnified and distorted\" by Palin's candidacy. The varied and \"complex nuances of gender and feminist constructions raised by the Palin phenomenon\" are addressed by Katha Pollitt, Amy Alexander, Amanda Fortini and Emily Bazelon, among others.\nThe cover is a parody of hers and it certainly takes some shots and mocks Sarah Palin, but it is a very serious book and the book itself is not a parody. It is not at all intended as a joke or a parody.\n\u2014\u2009Richard Kim, senior editor at The Nation\nOR Books cofounder Colin Robinson announced that they intended to promote the book with a web video by documentary filmmaker Robert Greenwald, which they planned to \"send around virally\" leading up to the November 17 release date. Customers wanting the book would initially only have two choices, to order the book as an ebook download for $10 or order a print-on-demand paperback for $16. Such low production costs Robinson believed would allow OR to promote the book heavily on the Internet, with perhaps some print advertising as well. Afterwards, OR Books hoped to entertain offers from reprint houses looking to buy the paperback rights. The book was eventually released on Amazon, achieving a sales rank of #825 in books for the week of December 14, 2009 and dropping to #7,309 for the week of January 29, 2010 (Going Rogue, in contrast, was #58 that same week).\nVarious news sources, including CNN and Fox News, have confused Going Rouge and Going Rogue in articles intended to discuss Palin's memoir.\nWriter Geoffrey Dunn, author of The Lies of Sarah Palin: The Untold Story Behind Her Relentless Quest for Power, gave the book a favorable review, describing it as \"full of golden nuggets.\" Dunn concluded his remarks by stating \"One thing is certain: You will read far more about the real Sarah Palin in Going Rouge than you ever will in her own memoirs, being published by who else? Rupert Murdoch.\"\nA reviewer writing in the San Francisco Chronicle said that the book contains \"articles by some of the most thought provoking writers in America who have chronicled the foibles and pratfalls of Sarah Palin.\"\nGeier, Thom (October 21, 2009). \"Attention, Sarah Palin Bashers: Lookalike Book 'Going Rouge' Is Coming\".

Manticore recalls all of its merchant vessels from Solarian space, and takes control of several wormholes, denying access to Solarian traffic. As the repercussions of these actions begin to reverberate throughout the League, its unelected controlling bureaucrats, known derisively as \"the five Mandarins\", start feeling the pressure from the transstellar corporations and criticism from the media. While it is clear that Manticore is in a position to inflict tremendous damage to the League economy, the Mandarins are not willing to pay the political and diplomatic price of taking responsibility for the actions of the League Navy, and continue to believe in the League Navy's technological superiority over the mere \"neobarbs\" of the Star Empire. They support Admiral Rajampet's planned invasion of the Manticore System, despite the risk that failure would make them look even weaker.\nIn the meantime, Captain Anton Zilwicki and Agent Victor Cachat arrive on Haven and present to President Eloise Pritchart their evidence of Mesan involvement in the assassinations that triggered the resumption of hostilities between Haven and Manticore. Upon hearing this and supporting information from a Mesan defector, Dr. Herlander Sim\u00f5es, Pritchart sets out on an unprecedented state visit to Manticore. The evidence is presented to a reluctant Empress Elizabeth, who is finally convinced that Haven is no longer the enemy and agrees not only to negotiate a peace treaty but to accept Pritchart's offer of military alliance against the upcoming League attack (a \"re-run\" of the same scene from Mission of Honor). Hearing about this visit and the intelligence Zilwicki and Cachat brought with them regarding Mesa's plans, the Beowulf government joins the new \"Grand Alliance\". Shortly afterward, Protector Benjamin Mayhew arrives from Grayson to participate in the peace talks and to represent the other members of the Manticoran Alliance. The Sphinxian treecats, of whom Honor's companion Nimitz is one, communicate to Honor their ability to detect the instant when a Mesan nanotech victim is triggered and offer to help defend the humans against it.\nAt Beowulf, a fleet meant to reinforce the League's 11th Fleet attempts to transition through the wormhole junction but is forced to retreat by the combined forces of the Beowulf System Defense Force and a Manticoran task force under the command of Admiral Alice Truman. Meanwhile, Solarian Admiral Filareta arrives at Manticore at the head of 11th Fleet, 427 superdreadnoughts strong, to find Honor with only 40 Manticoran SDs to her name. He confidently ignores her warnings that the Alliance is more than ready to deal with his attack. Harrington's trap involves another 150 Grayson SDs lying in stealth in front of 11th Fleet, while Haven's 250 SDs drop out of hyperspace behind it. (The Second Battle of Manticore, like the first, sets a record as the largest space battle in history.) Filareta realizes that his position is hopeless and orders a surrender, but his operations officer, a victim of the Mesan nanotech, instead triggers a wild launch of unarmed missiles and then a hidden bomb, destroying the flagship's bridge and killing everyone therein including himself. The resulting \"battle\" ends with nearly 300 Solarian ships destroyed at the cost of only a few LACs, and 1.2 million Solarians KIA, another 1.4 million captured, to a mere 2,000 Alliance casualties.\nUpon news of 11th Fleet's destruction, the Mandarins find themselves having to deal with the resulting blow to the League's prestige. They accuse Manticore of perfidy and Beowulf of treason for its discordance with League policy towards Manticore. Their efforts to sway the public are successful. Meanwhile, Queen Elizabeth helps organize the marriage of the heir apparent, Prince Roger, to which much of Haven's political leaders are invited.  President Pritchart announces that their peace treaty has been ratified by the Haven senate and that the Second Havenite-Manticoran War is officially over.\nAdmiral Rajampet is forced to kill himself by Mesan nanotech control. His deputy, Admiral Winston Kingsford, becomes the acting head of the Solarian League Navy. He informs Kolokoltsov that Manticore's technological advantage is so overwhelming that any further military"

The Grand Alliance of the Star Empire of Manticore, the Republic of Haven, the Protectorate of Grayson, and the newly independent Republic of Beowulf, among others, are at war with the Solarian League. \nThe Mesan Alignment, having worked for centuries in the background to establish a new galactic order under which it can impose genetic modification of the human race, has suffered several setbacks in recent years at the hands of the Alliance, especially the Manticore of Admiral Honor Harrington. In response, the Alignment's leaders arrange an escalating series of atrocities.  \nWhile the League has an elected government, executive power is dominated by the Quintet, senior bureaucrats who hold permanent tenure in \"Old Chicago,\" Planet Earth. The Alignment has extensively infiltrated the League's political and military institutions, but the \"Mandarins,\" as they are commonly known, refuse to believe they are being played as they wage war on the Alliance. \nThe Mandarins are forced to grapple with the Alliance's massive technological and tactical advantages; the Solarian League Navy cannot hope to fight a pitched battle and survive, even with vastly superior numbers. Alignment agents convince them to authorize \"Operation Buccaneer,\" the complete destruction of all space-borne infrastructure in every star system that continues to trade with their enemies. League commanders are given discretion to arrange for the evacuation of civilians first, but the \"Parthian Shot\" contingency authorizes mass-casualty hit-and-run raids as needed.  \nThe Royal Manticoran Navy annihilates one League raiding force in the Prime and Ajay systems; a Manticoran detachment later beats back a raid on the Hypatia System, at the cost of 90 percent casualties. Later on, the Alignment accelerates \"Operation Houdini\" on the planet Mesa itself, which has been occupied by the Alliance; dozens of nuclear charges are detonated across the planet to erase evidence of the Alignment's existence and frame the Alliance for the deaths of millions of civilians. \nEvents come to a head when the League invades Beowulf. Though Alliance defenses are sabotaged by a secret Alignment weapon, the defenders still manage to defeat the League force. However, the Alignment has smuggled nuclear weapons aboard Beowulf's orbital habitats. The detonations kill more than 43 million people, mostly civilians, but also large numbers of Alliance officials. (Harrington's husband, Admiral Alexander, barely escapes with his life.) The bombings occur well after the total defeat of the League force, showing who is responsible.\nIn response, the Alliance decides to bring a swift end to its conflict with the League. In \"Operation Nemesis,\" Admiral Harrington and her Grand Fleet enter the solar system and demonstrate their overwhelming technological superiority, forcing the surrender of the Solarian League Navy without suffering a single casualty. To punish the League for its aggression and atrocities, Harrington has 2,000 years of built-up orbital infrastructure throughout the solar system destroyed, although no civilians are killed. Harrington threatens to repeat this action in the next four most wealthy systems, and then the next four, and so on, unless the League accepts the surrender terms. The Mandarins refuse to give up, but military and political leaders on Earth, having uncovered the Alignment's infiltration of the League, depose them and promulgate reforms.\nUncompromising Honor debuted at #9 on the New York Times Bestseller List.\n\"Uncompromising Honor\".

A Rising Thunder is a science fiction novel by American writer by David Weber, released on March 6, 2012 by Baen Books. It is the thirteenth novel set in the Honorverse in the main Honor Harrington series. The novel was originally split into two books due to its size, leading in a delay of publication.\nA Rising Thunder debuted at #3 on the New York Times Bestseller List. It dropped to #15 in the second week, #25 in the third week, #27 in the fourth week, and dropped off the list on April 22, 2012.\nReaders on the Baen Ebooks site have offered mixed opinions on the book, some criticizing it for being too long without enough action, and others praising it for being \"more focused\" and containing less \"meaningless rambling dialog\", and \"still very good\".\nLiz Bourke, in her review on Tor.com, expressed disappointment in the \"continuing...lack of focus\" in the recent Honor Harrington books, which lack the \"enthusiasm and vibrancy\" of the earlier books. She also found \"the spiraling profusion of names\" caused problems in the political discussions and battle sequences, allowing for \"little unity\". Despite the problems she found, Bourke says there are \"flashes\" of the \"solid character[s] and solid action and a relatively entertaining flow of techsposition\", just less than is usually found in Weber's work.\n\"A Rising Thunder\".

Composed over a year's time in 189495, serialized in 189596, and published in book form in 1897, it was the sole historical novel by an author who had earlier disapproved of historical novels on the ground that they inevitably distort history. Pharaoh has been described by Czesaw Miosz as a \"novel on... mechanism[s] of state power and, as such, ... probably unique in world literature of the nineteenth century.... Prus, [in] selecting the reign of 'Pharaoh Ramses XIII' in the eleventh century BCE, sought a perspective that was detached from... pressures of [topicality] and censorship. ...",

Pharaoh comprises a compact, substantial introduction; sixty-seven chapters; and an evocative epilogue (the latter omitted at the book's original publication, and restored in the 1950s). Like Prus' previous novels, Pharaoh debuted (1895\u201396) in newspaper serialization\u2014in the Warsaw Tygodnik Ilustrowany (Illustrated Weekly). It was dedicated \"To my wife, Oktawia G\u0142owacka, n\u00e9e Trembi\u0144ska, as a small token of esteem and affection.\"\nUnlike the author's earlier novels, Pharaoh had first been composed in its entirety, rather than being written in chapters from issue to issue. This may account for its often being described as Prus' \"best-composed novel\"\u2014indeed, \"one of the best-composed Polish novels.\"\nThe original 1897 book edition and some subsequent ones divided the novel into three volumes. Later editions have presented it in two volumes or in a single one. Except in wartime, the book has never been out of print in Poland.\nPharaoh begins with one of the more memorable openings in a novel \u2014 an opening written in the style of an ancient chronicle:\nIn the thirty-third year of the happy reign of Ramses XII, Egypt celebrated two events that filled her loyal inhabitants with pride and joy.\nIn the month of Mechir, in December, there returned to Thebes laden with sumptuous gifts the god Khonsu, who had traveled three years and nine months in the land of Bukhten, restoring to health the local king's daughter named Bent-res and exorcising the evil spirit not only from the king's family but even from the fortress of Bukhten.\nAnd in the month of Pharmouthi, in February, the Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt, the ruler of Phoenicia and of the nine nations, Mer-amen-Ramses XII, after consulting the gods, to whom he is equal, named as his Successor to the Throne his twenty-two-year-old son Ham-sem-merer-amen-Ramses.\nThis choice delighted the pious priests, eminent nomarchs, valiant army, faithful people and all creatures living on Egyptian soil. For the Pharaoh's elder sons, born of the Hittite princess, had, due to spells that could not be investigated, been visited by an evil spirit. One, twenty-seven years old, had been unable to walk from his majority; another had cut his veins and died; and the third, after drinking tainted wine that he had been unwilling to give up, had gone mad and, fancying himself an ape, spent days on end in the trees.\n\nThe fourth son Ramses, however, born of Queen Nikotris, daughter of High Priest Amenhotep, was strong as the Apis bull, brave as a lion and wise as the priests....\nPharaoh combines features of several literary genres:  the historical novel, the political novel, the Bildungsroman, the utopian novel, the sensation novel. It also comprises a number of interbraided strands \u2014 including the plot line, Egypt's cycle of seasons, the country's geography and monuments, and ancient Egyptian practices (e.g. mummification rituals and techniques) \u2014 each of which rises to prominence at appropriate moments.\nMuch as in an ancient Greek tragedy, the fate of the novel's protagonist, the future \"Ramses XIII,\" is known from the beginning. Prus closes his introduction with the statement that the narrative \"relates to the eleventh century before Christ, when the Twentieth Dynasty fell and when, after the demise of the Son of the Sun the eternally living Ramses XIII, the throne was seized by, and the uraeus came to adorn the brow of, the eternally living Son of the Sun Sem-amen-Herhor, High Priest of Amon.\" What the novel will subsequently reveal is the elements that lead to this denouement\u2014the character traits of the principals, the social forces in play.\nAncient Egypt at the end of its New Kingdom period is experiencing adversities. The deserts are eroding Egypt's arable land. The country's population has declined from eight to six million. Foreign peoples are entering Egypt in ever-growing numbers, undermining its unity. The chasm between the peasants and craftsmen on one hand, and the ruling classes on the other, is growing, exacerbated by the ruling elites' fondness for luxury and idleness. The country is becoming ever more deeply indebted to Phoenician merchants, as imported goods destroy native industries.\nThe Egyptian priesthood, backbone of the bureaucracy and virtual monopolists of knowledge, have grown immensely wealthy at the expense of the pharaoh and the country. At the same time, Egypt is facing prospective peril at the hands of rising powers to the north \u2014 Assyria and Persia.\nThe 22-year-old Egyptian crown prince and viceroy Ramses, having made a careful study of his country and of the"

A girl from a Yoruba village is engaged to a hunter from another village. Having been seduced by a man returning to the village from his life in a Nigerian city, she nervously awaits her wedding night.\nAdebowale is considered a member of the \"third generation\" of Nigerian authors, whose works generally deal with more cosmopolitan themes than earlier generations of Nigerian writers. However, unlike other members of the \"third generation\", Adebowale's work deals with rural life in Nigeria, particularly life in small villages. The Virgin is an example of one such work; Adebowale believes that Nigerian writers and artists have a duty to examine and reflect on traditional Nigerian life.\nTunde Kelani wrote the screenplay and directed a 95-minute film version, titled The Narrow Path, filmed and released on May 12, 2006. The film starred Sola Asedeko, Ayo Badmus and Khabirat Kafidipe while the sound track was written and produced by Beautiful Nubia.\nThe film was edited by Mumin Wale Kelani and Frank Efe Patrick and the costume was designed by Abiola Atanda \nMuch of the dialogue and narration is taken directly from the novel.

It describes the life of a cowboy on a cattle ranch and is considered the first true fictional western ever written, aside from short stories and pulp dime novels, though modern scholars debate this. The Virginian paved the way for many more westerns by such authors as Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour and several others.

The Virginian is a ranch hand at the Sunk Creek Ranch, located outside of Medicine Bow, Wyoming. His friend Steve calls him \"Jeff\" presumably after Jefferson Davis, but he is always referred to as the Virginian, and no name is mentioned throughout the story. He is described as a tall, dark, slim young giant, with a deep personality. At first, he is only a cowboy, but halfway through the book, he is signed on as the full-time foreman. He is the Judge's most trusted worker. Several times throughout the book, he is offered the chance to run down his enemy, Trampas, behind his back, but each time he refuses the temptation, until Trampas challenges the Virginian to a duel. It is made clear that he will not use his official position as foreman to crush any of his employees.  One of the main plots is the Virginian's ongoing romance with the newly appointed \"schoolmarm\" of Bear Creek School, Miss Molly Stark Wood. Being from the East, she is not used to the wild West, and the Virginian is a perfect gentleman to her, intending to make her \"love him before we get through.\"\nThe novel begins with an unnamed narrator's arrival in Medicine Bow, Wyoming, from \"back East\" and his encounter with an impressively tall and handsome stranger. The stranger proves adept at roping horses, as well as facing down a gambler, Trampas, who calls him a \"son of a bitch.\" (At the time, the word was an unacceptable insult in any society, except between joking friends.) The stranger lays a pistol on the table and gently threatens, \"When you call me that, smile!\"  Known only as the Virginian, the stranger turns out to be the narrator's escort to Judge Henry's ranch in Sunk Creek, Wyoming. As the two travel the 263 miles to the ranch, the narrator, who is nicknamed the Tenderfoot, and the Virginian come to know one another as the Tenderfoot slowly begins to understand the nature of life in the West, which is very different from what he expected. This meeting is the beginning of a lifelong friendship and the starting point of the narrator's recounting of key episodes in the life of the Virginian.\nThe novel revolves around the Virginian and the life he lives. As well as describing the Virginian's conflict with his enemy, Trampas, and his romance with the pretty schoolteacher, Molly Stark Wood, Wister weaves a tale of action, violence, hate, revenge, love, and friendship. In one scene, the Virginian is forced to participate in the hanging of Steve, an admitted cattle thief who had been his close friend. The hanging is represented as a necessary response to the government's corruption and lack of action, but the Virginian feels it to be a horrible duty. He is especially stricken by the bravery with which the thief faces his fate, and the heavy burden that the act places on his heart forms the emotional core of the story.\nA fatal shootout resolves the ongoing conflict with Trampas after five years of hate. After Trampas shoots first in a duel, the Virginian shoots Trampas in self defense and leaves to marry his young bride. The Virginian and Molly ride off together to spend a month in the mountains and then journey back East to Vermont to meet her family. They are received a bit stiffly by the immediate Wood family, but warmly by Molly's great-aunt. The new couple returns to Wyoming, and the Virginian is made a partner of Judge Henry's ranch. The book ends noting that the Virginian became an important man in the territory with a happy family.\nThe 1902 novel had an enormous influence on publishing, and later movies and television, establishing the Western genre and especially the cowboy ideal as an American icon.  Its climactic gun duel is the first \"showdown\" in fiction.\nThe novel is also the first known use of the phrase: \"When you call me that, smile!\"  This line, in many versions, became common in later Western works, from movies to music.\nTwenty-first century scholars of Western fiction debate whether The Virginian should be considered as the first cowboy novel outside the dime novel tradition. Victoria Lamont, for example, argues that this distinction belongs to The Administratrix by Emma Ghent Curtis (John B. Alden Publishing, 1889), which was published thirteen years earlier.\n\nWister and Kirke La Shelle adapted the novel for a stage production. The Virginian opened at the Manhattan Theatre on January 5, 1904, and ran until May 1904. It was reprised in October 1905 for 16 performances at the Academy of Music in New York City.\nThe Virginian (1914 film) directed by Cecil B. DeMille, with Dustin Farnum\nThe Virginian (1923 film) with Kenneth Harlan and Florence Vidor\nThe Virginian (1929 film) with Gary Cooper and Walter Huston\nThe"

                "description": "The Virgin is the 1985 debut novel by Nigerian writer Bayo Adebowale. The novel, published in 1985, narrated the dilemma of a village young girl who must choose between three suitors, who is deflowered  and agonizes about her secret being discovered on her wedding night. Scholar Wendy Griswold classifies The Virgin as a \"village novel\", a book that deals with the mores of a traditional Nigerian village, in the same vein as some works by Chinua Achebe.",

A girl from a Yoruba village is engaged to a hunter from another village. Having been seduced by a man returning to the village from his life in a Nigerian city, she nervously awaits her wedding night.\nAdebowale is considered a member of the \"third generation\" of Nigerian authors, whose works generally deal with more cosmopolitan themes than earlier generations of Nigerian writers. However, unlike other members of the \"third generation\", Adebowale's work deals with rural life in Nigeria, particularly life in small villages. The Virgin is an example of one such work; Adebowale believes that Nigerian writers and artists have a duty to examine and reflect on traditional Nigerian life.\nTunde Kelani wrote the screenplay and directed a 95-minute film version, titled The Narrow Path, filmed and released on May 12, 2006. The film starred Sola Asedeko, Ayo Badmus and Khabirat Kafidipe while the sound track was written and produced by Beautiful Nubia.\nThe film was edited by Mumin Wale Kelani and Frank Efe Patrick and the costume was designed by Abiola Atanda \nMuch of the dialogue and narration is taken directly from the novel. The film is considered faithful to the book in spite of the latter's non-traditional narrative.\nGriswold, Wendy (19 June 2000).

In modern times, it is often published with the title The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in order to distinguish it from Saint Augustine's Confessions. Covering the first fifty-three years of Rousseau's life, up to 1765, it was completed in 1769, but not published until 1782, four years after Rousseau's death, even though Rousseau did read excerpts of his manuscript publicly at various salons and other meeting places.",

The Confessions was two distinct works, each part consisting of six books. Books I to VI were written between 1765 and 1767 and published in 1782, while books VII to XII were written in 1769\u20131770 and published in 1789. Rousseau alludes to a planned third part, but it was never completed. Though the book contains factual inaccuracies\u2014in particular, Rousseau's dates are frequently off, some events are out of order, and others are misrepresented, incomplete, or incorrect\u2014Rousseau provides an account of the experiences that shaped his personality and ideas. For instance, some parts of his own education are clearly present in his account of ideal education, Emile, or On Education.\nRousseau's work is notable as one of the first major autobiographies. Prior to the Confessions, the two great autobiographies were Augustine's own Confessions and Saint Teresa's Life of Herself. However, both of these works focused on the religious experiences of their authors; the Confessions was one of the first autobiographies in which an individual wrote of his own life mainly in terms of his worldly experiences and personal feelings. Rousseau recognized the unique nature of his work; it opens with the famous words: \"I have resolved on an enterprise which has no precedent and which, once complete, will have no imitator. My purpose is to display to my kind a portrait in every way true to nature, and the man I shall portray will be myself.\" His example was soon followed: not long after publication, many other writers (such as Goethe, Wordsworth, Stendhal, De Quincey, Casanova and Alfieri) wrote their own autobiographies in a similar fashion.\nThe Confessions is also noted for its detailed account of Rousseau's more humiliating and shameful moments. For instance, Rousseau recounts an incident when, while a servant, he covered up his theft of a ribbon by framing a young girl\u2014who was working in the house\u2014for the crime. In addition, Rousseau explains the manner in which he disposes of the five children he had with Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Levasseur.\nAccording to historian Paul Johnson, Rousseau's autobiography contains many inaccuracies. Will and Ariel Durant have written that the debate regarding the truthfulness of the book hinges on Rousseau's allegation that Grimm and Diderot had connived to give a mendacious description of his relationship with Mme. d'\u00c9pinay, Mme. d'Houdetot, and themselves. As stated by Durant, most scholarly opinion prior to 1900 was against Rousseau, but subsequently several scholars including Frederika Macdonald, Pierre-Maurice Masson, Mathew Johnson, \u00c9mile Faguet, Jules Lema\u00eetre and C. E. Vaughn have reached judgments in favor of Rousseau's veracity.\nLet them eat cake, a saying deriving from this book\nThe New Confessions, a novel by William Boyd (1987)\nFor instance, the biography of his mother; see Damrosch 9.\nJohnson 17.\nWill Durant (1967).

Born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Edwidge Danticat visited the Dajab\u00f3n River, across the Haitian border in the Dominican Republic, in 1995 and was surprised to find the people there seemingly unaware of the brutal killings that had taken place there during the Parsley massacre (1937), when tens of thousands of Haitian workers were murdered. Danticat set out to memorialize the victims and their suffering, by telling their stories and spreading knowledge.\n\nSet in 1937, the story starts out in the rural town of Alegr\u00eda, which consists of many sugarcane mills and plantations that require the cheap and plentiful labor the Haitians supply. There is a huge gap between the Haitian workers and the rich Dominicans who they work for. As Amabelle tries to escape the government's intentions to \"cleanse the country\" by removing Haitians from the Dominican Republic, she travels as far as the Massacre River that borders the Dominican Republic and Haiti.\nSugar cane dominates the economy described in the novel; the title, The Farming of Bones, is explained in Chapter 10 when Amabelle refers to process of growing, burning, and cutting cane as \"travay te pou zo\", or \"the farming of bones\".\nPrior to the tensions ramping up to a peak in 1937, there was a time in which the borderlands between Haiti and the Dominican Republic were a more peaceful place. Dominicans and Haitians had worked together, socialized together, and even inter-married before the conflict. However, after the death of Ramon Caceres in 1911, a lot of political instability was brought to the forefront of the country, resulting in U.S. occupation for eight years. The occupation was received very negatively, inciting even more political instability and violence in the Dominican Republic. When Rafael Trujillo took over the government in 1930, there was an intense poverty in the country and Trujillo worked to end the financial crisis at the cost of taking away many rights from the citizens, especially the Haitian migrant workers.\nOrphaned by the age of 8, young Haitian Amabelle works for Don Ignacio and his daughter, in hopes of marrying her lover, Sebastien Onius. After the accidental death of one of Sebastien's fellow cane workers, the Haitian's distrust of the Dominican government grows, and this distrust is warranted. With news of the Generalissimo's intentions to \u201ccleanse the country,\u201d Haitian workers attempt to return to their home country.\nWhen complications separate Amabelle and Sebastien during their attempt to flee, Amabelle is desperate to find what has become of Sebastien.  Accompanied by Sebastien's friend, Yves, Amabelle makes her journey with the help of fellow survivors she encounters along the way.  While escaping, the group must divide for their own safety. Upon reaching the town of Dajabon, Amabelle is disappointed to find that Sebastien is not there. While in Dajabon, Dominicans beat and torture Amabelle, Yves, and a fellow Haitian, Tibon, after recognizing their inability to pronounce \u201cperejil\u201d correctly, one of the most prevalent ways that the Dominicans determine the segregation of Haitians. On the verge of death, two remaining members of their group rescue Amabelle and Yves and bring them to the river that they must cross. Unfortunately, only Amabelle and Yves survive the dangerous crossing, where they are met at the other side by nuns who nurse them back to health. During the recovery process, Amabelle learns of the other survivors\u2019 story of \u201ckout kouto,\u201d what the Haitians call the massacre.\nOnce Amabelle and Yves have healed, Yves offers to take Amabelle to his home. Upon arrival of the city, Amabelle and Yves settle in his home and try to rebuild their lives. While Yves finds solace in working in his father's fields and becomes a successful landowner, Amabelle continues her search for Sebastien. After finding Sebastien's mother and learning of the truth about Sebastien's fate, Amabelle returns to her life with Yves. Although Yves and Amabelle try to find comfort in one another, they are unable to fulfill each other's needs. Twenty years after her escape from Alegr\u00eda, Amabelle decides to search for a connection to Sebastien by reliving old memories in places of the past. Despite reuniting with Senora Valencia, Amabelle is dissatisfied with the results of her search. In the final scene of the novel, Amabelle enters and rests in the Massacre River, winnowing through a handful of memories. Although distressed by loss, Amabelle finds the spiritual resilience to search for a new beginning.\nThe Farming of Bones is told in first person narrative through the"

This is the story of the four Mirabal sisters during the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. At school, one of the sisters, Minerva, meets a girl, Sinita, who later became one of her best friends. Sinita eventually confided in Minerva the truth about Trujillo - that their \"glorious\" leader was a killer. The sisters make a political commitment to overthrow the Trujillo regime. They are harassed, persecuted, and imprisoned, all while their family suffers retaliation from the Military Intelligence Service (SIM).\nAs vengeance for their political activities, Trujillo orders three of the sisters be killed on Puerto Plata Road, with their driver Rufino, while returning from visiting their husbands in jail. The women and driver are beaten to death and later their vehicle and bodies are dumped off a cliff in order to make their deaths look like an accident.\nMinerva: The third Mirabal sister, and certainly the most headstrong. She is focused on law school, and succeeds in completing it as an adult, although Trujillo withholds law license as revenge. She has a brief romance with the revolutionary leader \"Lio\" before she meets Manolo in law school (also a revolutionary) and marries him. She has two children, a daughter Minou and a son Manolito.\nDed\u00e9: Dede is the second Mirabal sister. She is not as certain about the revolution as her sisters and feels weaker because of that fact. She doesn't want to join the revolution because she believes that it will lead to death , so she doesn't. She uses her husband, Jaimito, as the reason she doesn't officially join. He doesn't want her involved in the revolution, and the conflict almost destroys their marriage. She is constantly worrying about her sisters, telling them they'll be killed. She has children, all boys, Enrique, Rafael, and David. In the end, she is the only survivor of her four sisters. \nMar\u00eda Teresa: The youngest of the four Mirabal sisters, she is very materialistic. She marries Leandro and has one daughter, named Jacqueline. She joined the revolution while she is living with her sister Minerva. She joined because she wanted to feel worthy of Leandro. \nPatria:  The oldest of the Mirabal sisters, she is very religious. While looking for her calling from God, she instead finds her husband, Pedrito, whom she marries at age 16. Her faith wavers intensely as a young woman. She takes the miscarriage of her third child as God's punishment towards her, which drives her further into a religious depression. She later regains her faith on a pilgrimage to Higuey that she takes with her mother and sisters. She has three children: Nelson, Noris, and Raul Ernesto. She is also a revolutionary, starting a Christian revolutionary group and merging it with her sister Minerva's revolutionary group. Also her tone went from being a little confusing in the beginning and losing her relationship with her family to becoming more connected to her family.\nTrujillo: Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, also known as \"El Jefe\" (\"the Chief\"), the main antagonist of the novel. He is the self-appointed dictator of the Dominican Republic. A harsh ruler, he demands complete obedience of everyone and commits many cruel and unjust acts against his people, such as imprisonment without trial, confiscating land, possessions, and torture. Though married, he has many affairs with young girls who he keeps in houses around the country.  He is also identified as a rapist.  As his regime falls apart, he becomes even more vicious and cruel, and eventually has the Mirabal sisters (all except for Dede) killed when they become too much of an opposition to his decaying power.\nMam\u00e1: Mother to the Mirabal girls, and married to Papa. She takes care of the girls and is always worried about them. Despite being matriarch of a plantation with servants, she is described as illiterate.\nPap\u00e1: Father to the Mirabal girls, and married to Mama. He heads the family store.\nPedrito Gonz\u00e1lez: A farmer. He married Patria Mirabal when she was 16, on February 24, 1947. He and his wife eventually join the revolution, along with their son, Nelson. He is later imprisoned, along with his brothers-in-law, Leandro and Manolo, for participating in the revolution. He and Patria have three children: Nelson, Noris, and Raulito.\nManolo: A law student when he first arrives in the novel, Manolo is Minerva's husband."

The book describes in words the basic message of Werner Erhard's Erhard Seminars Training (est) theatrical experience. Erhard/est sued in federal court in the United States to stop the book from publication, but the suit failed. The book takes a 'trainer's' approach to the est experience, in that it essentially duplicates the est training, citing examples and using jargon from the actual experience. The title became a New York Times #2 best-seller, with more than a million copies in print, but overall critical reception was negative. ...",

Frederick graduated from Penn State University with a Bachelor of Science. degree in Psychology. He also received an MBA degree from the University of Chicago, and gained professional experience in advertising and marketing. He worked for Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, Ohio as a product manager in the company's Advertising Department. Subsequently, he went to Heublein in Hartford, Connecticut, where he held the position of Director of New Products. Finally, Frederick became VP/Director of Marketing for Hot Wheels at MattelToys in Los Angeles.\nA graduate and devotee of est, Carl wrote the book while working to become a Seminar Leader for the est training. After the book became a best-seller, Frederick traveled to Hawaii, then traversed the globe in a sailboat. Along the way, he held management positions on various consulting projects in marketing and advertising, consulting, and also worked in journalism at a newspaper in New Zealand. In 1985, Carl started a U.S. business which distributed Harley Davidson accessories. The company carried out operations in the South Pacific, Hawaii, and California. Frederick eventually settled Costa Rica. where he constructed and managed a tourist resort in 1997.\nIn 2012, Frederick published a revised edition of the est book, and also released a new title: What To Do When The Earth Splits In Two.  Both titles are available on Amazon ~ Kindle for the e-books and Create Space for the paperbacks.\nWerner Erhard/est sued Frederick, reportedly in an attempt to prevent publication of the book. In an article \"30 Years After the 'EST' Experience\" which appeared in the 2003 Collectors Edition of his book, Frederick discussed the litigation initiated against him by Werner Erhard. Frederick wrote that his 200-plus page manuscript for the book was initially titled The Game of Life and How To Win It. According to Frederick, he sent a copy of the book to about 12 publishers, and also sent a personal copy to Erhard. Frederick wrote that Erhard responded by suing him in U.S. Federal Court, claiming \"I had infringed his copyrighted material - BUT, he didn't attach any material to his complaint. Moreover, I never saw anything printed in est, it was all live theater\", and I was never asked to sign anything that said what I could (or couldn't) do as a result of taking the est training\"\nFrederick described his account of the litigation: \"Erhard sent seven lawyers to the courtroom; I had one. They argued I was taking illegal liberty with the most incredible educational system in existence, and that I must be stopped immediately. The judge must have thought that we were arguing over some might trivial scribblings, because he just looked up quizzingly over his Franklin specs and threw the whole case right out the door.\" Erhard filed three lawsuits against Frederick, claiming copyright infringement. All of est/Erhard's suits were ruled 'nuisance claims'and summarily \"thrown out of court\" in 1976.\nAfter the lawsuits concluded, Frederick signed a book deal with Dell/Delacorte Press, New York, receiving \"more money in advance than any unknown author in the history of the United States.\" Frederick's agent, Ron Bernstein of Candida Donadio & Associates, commented on the book's successful publication in the face of the multiple lawsuits by Erhard/est: \"... we feel this book's publication is a major victory against est's attempts to control the media.\" Originally copyrighted in 1974 by Delacorte Press, the book was first published in 1976, and republished in 1981. A Collector's Edition was published in 2003 by Synergy International of the Americas, and the author issued a revised Edition in 2012, which is now being sold on Amazon's Kindle and a paperback is available from Amazon Create Space.\nThe book essentially duplicates the est training in words. It is dedicated \"To Werner .. the ultimate experience in beingness\". Frederick takes the reader through the experience of the est training by providing vivid episodes which present the est perspective. He uses language to incite the reader in an attempt to reproduce this experience. Frederick utilizes stylistic techniques in the book such as text in all capital letters, instructing the reader, \"THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS NO INHERENT SIGNIFICANCE TO ANYTHING YOU ARE, YOU DO, OR YOU HAVE.\"\nFrederick incorporates jargon from the est training in the work. He alternates between referring to the reader as \"an ass\" or \"baby\". The book contains short segments on various themes titled: \"Total Acceptance and Responsibility\", \"Winners and Losers\", and \"The Game of Life\". Chapter headings include: \"How to Get All the Cheese in Life\" and \"How to"

                "description": "Inside, Outside is a 1985 Herman Wouk novel telling the story of four generations of a Russian Jewish family and its travails in Russia and America. The book is a first person (and somewhat autobiographical) narrative told from the viewpoint of Israel David Goodkind, the third of the four generations in the book. Goodkind works in a minor bureaucratic post in the White House between March and October 1973; his insignificance gives him time to write his memoirs (the book itself, told as though Goodkind wrote it) while his position gives him opportunities to come face to face with the harried president Richard Nixon. Nixon never is named in the book, but there can be no doubt as to his identity. ...",

The story alternates between Goodkind's telling his family history and early years (specifically, his first 26 years (1915\u20131941)) and his account of current events in 1973, leading up to the Yom Kippur War. The tales of Goodkind's early years describe his family \u2013 his mother and father, his sister, his mother's father and father's mother, his mother's half sister, and a tribe of more distant uncles, aunts and cousins (the 'Mishpokha', Yiddish for 'family'). After college, Goodkind works for Harry Goldhandler, a gag writer for radio comedies (very loosely based on David Freedman), and has a romance with showgirl Bobbie Webb. The tales of his present day in 1973 are centered on his wife, his daughter, their friends, and Peter Quat, a college friend who also worked for Goldhandler, and who had become a famous novelist for his sexually explicit characters and unflattering depictions of American Jewish life. Quat's books seem similar to the work of Philip Roth, but Roth did not attend Columbia nor work for Freedman.\nAs a young man, Goodkind becomes less observant, but his adult self has returned to the Orthodox practices of his father and grandfather. Goodkind as a child and young man is embarrassed by his first name Israel, mockingly shortened by several other characters to Izzy. In the last scene of the novel when Goodkind returns to the U.S. after the Yom Kippur War, he tells an El Al flight attendant to call him Israel.\nAmong the famous people Goodkind comes face to face with in the course of the book besides Nixon are Golda Meir, Zero Mostel, Bert Lahr, Marlene Dietrich, John Barrymore, Ernest Hemingway, Leslie Howard, and the brothers George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin. Goodkind visits Israel during the Yom Kippur War, carries a secret letter from Golda Meir to Richard Nixon, and rides back to Israel with the U.S. Air Force airlift of supplies."

Exit Ghost is a 2007 novel by Philip Roth. It is the ninth, and last, novel featuring Nathan Zuckerman.\nThe stage direction, \"exit ghost\" appears in three of William Shakespeare's plays: Hamlet, Macbeth and Julius Caesar. In a BBC interview, Roth stated that using this direction as a title \"came to me because of Macbeth. Last year in the summer I was going to see a production of Macbeth here in America, and I re-read the script that afternoon, and I came upon the Banquo scene, ghost scene, and it just leaped out \u2014 'exit ghost' \u2014 and that's the title of my book, so I just lifted it.\" In the novel Jamie and Billy read Macbeth aloud to each other, marveling grimly at its relevance to George W. Bush's first administration.\nThe title also refers to that of the first Zuckerman book, The Ghost Writer. At one point, Bellette says to Zuckerman that Lonoff (whom she imagines talking to her from beyond the grave) told her, \"Reading/writing people, we are finished, we are ghosts witnessing the end of a literary era.\"\nCritic Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times called the novel \"elegiac\" and \"a kind of valedictory bookend to The Ghost Writer, adding \"Mr. Roth has created a melancholy, if occasionally funny, meditation on aging, mortality, loneliness and the losses that come with the passage of time.\"\nJordan, Justine (2006-12-30). \"New voices and extra helpings\".

Lirael (called Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr in some regions) is a fantasy novel by Garth Nix, first published in 2001. Named for its central female character, Lirael is the second in his Old Kingdom trilogy, preceded by Sabriel and continued in Abhorsen.\nThe book is split into three parts, the first of which is set 14 years after the events in Sabriel; the last two parts are set five years after part one. Sabriel and Touchstone have married since Sabriel and assumed a measure of control over the Old Kingdom. Their children Ellimere and Sameth were going to school in Ancelstierre (similarly to Sabriel) before being expected to take up their duties in the Old Kingdom.\nLirael - title character, raised as an orphan Clayr, half-sister of Sabriel.\nDisreputable Dog - a Free Magic creature also infused with Charter Magic, she was only supposed to be a puppy sending to comfort Lirael; however, while creating the sending, Lirael touched on some ancient magic in the dog statuette she found in the Clayr library and awoke the Dog\nPrince Sameth - the son of King Touchstone and the Abhorsen Sabriel; enjoys making toys and is one, if not the last, of the Wallmakers who made the Wall which divides the two Kingdoms; he has been into Death and was Abhorsen-in-Waiting before Lirael's ascent into the title and role, but his encounter with Hedge has left him with an almost mortal fear of Death\nMogget - an ancient Free Magic construct of unknown origin; appears in the form of a white cat and is bound by a red Charter magic collar to serve the Abhorsen\nNicholas Sayre - a friend of Sameth from Ancelstierre, a sceptic who does not believe in magic and is always looking for a scientific reason for magical phenomena.\nEllimere - Sameth's older sister, destined to be Queen\nSabriel - the current Abhorsen, who destroyed Kerrigor many years before with the King, the former Abhorsen, and Mogget; is also wed to Touchstone and is Queen\nTouchstone - the King, a bastard son of a Queen and a nobleman who was trapped as a wooden figurehead of a funeral ship for 200 or so years before Sabriel saved him\nHedge - an ancient necromancer serving a greater power; he attempts to capture Prince Sameth but obtains Nicholas Sayre instead\nChlorr of the Mask - an ancient necromancer who Sabriel defeats early in Lirael, later raised by Hedge to become one of the Greater Dead\nSanar and Ryelle - Clayr twins who have the strongest Sight and aid both the Royal family and Lirael\nThe novel is more soul-searching than its predecessor Sabriel, and the major theme is that society does not have to dictate the outcome of one's future. Lirael comes to terms with her lack of the Sight by becoming busy in the Library, going nearer and nearer to her birthright as the Remembrancer, and, eventually, the Abhorsen-in-Waiting. This is also echoed in Sameth's story, as he struggles to accept (or avoid) his role as Abhorsen-in-Waiting.\nFrench, Emma (April 27, 2017). \"Best librarian characters in fantasy fiction\". OUPblog.

Dolphin loves Marigold and thinks she is wonderful and unique, while Star is embarrassed by Marigold's tattoos and erratic behavior. Dolphin feels like an outsider at school; she is bullied by some classmates and feels her teacher is unkind to her. She also struggles with her dyslexia. Star appears to be more popular, and Dolphin dislikes the fact that Star has an older boyfriend. Dolphin later befriends Oliver, a shy and studious boy who spends the lunch period in the library to avoid being teased.\nMarigold buys tickets to see her favorite band Emerald City, with the intention of finding Micky, Star's father, who Marigold is still in love with. Both girls are surprised when she returns that night with Micky. He was unaware he had a daughter and is thrilled to meet Star, and she adores him in turn. Dolphin however dislikes him because she feels that he abandoned Marigold and neglected Star. Micky takes them all to London for the day and they do number of fun activities and shopping. Despite it all, Dolphin feels ignored the entire day by all of them. Marigold is completely convinced they will all live together now as a family, but Micky drops them all home and returns to his place in Brighton. \nIn the days which follow Micky sends them presents, and Star goes to spend a weekend with him. Marigold who had hoped to reconcile romantically with Micky and is upset to hear that he has a girlfriend living with him. Micky who has no feelings for Marigold due to her mental behavior invites both Star and Dolphin to come live with him.

After Star leaves, Marigold has a mental breakdown and paints herself white all over using toxic paint to hide her tattoos. Dolphin phones for an ambulance despite knowing Marigold's fear of hospitals. Later Dolphin finds out that due to her mental illness Marigold may be in hospital for some time.\nWith her mum in hospital ill and with nowhere else to go, Oliver encourages Dolphin to contact her father, who she knows nothing about, except that his name is also Micky and he works as a swimming instructor. Together they manage to track him down and he's pleased to meet her. Dolphin hopes he will look after her, but learns he has a wife and daughters already and decides to do things properly, getting in touch with child services so Dolphin can be in foster care for a while. Dolphin is initially terrified of going into a foster home having heard Marigold's horror stories from her own childhood in foster homes, but she stays with a kind older woman and three babies. Her father takes her to visit Marigold, who is on medication for bipolar disorder. And the two slowly begin to develop a father-daughter relationship.\nStar appears at the foster home after returning to the flat to find both Marigold and Dolphin gone. Star stays in foster care with Dolphin and they argue at first, Star blaming everything on Dolphin for ruining her time with Micky and refuses to believe what Dolphin tells her. But then they reconcile and go to visit Marigold together. The story ends with Dolphin deciding that even though Marigold is in hospital and she and Star in foster care, they are still a family.\nThe television drama stars Michelle Collins as Marigold Westward, and Alice Connor and Holly Grainger as her daughters Dolphin and Star respectively.

A recurring theme throughout the stories is the conflict of the cold mechanics of technology and the psychology of people. It was nominated for the International Fantasy Award in 1952. The unrelated stories are tied together by the frame story of \"The Illustrated Man\", a vagrant former member of a carnival freak show with an extensively tattooed body whom the unnamed narrator meets. The man's tattoos, allegedly created by a time-traveling woman, are individually animated, and each tells a different tale. ...",

A child psychologist suggests that the automated house is not good for the children's development, nor the parents', and insists they disable the automation and take a vacation to become more self-sufficient. \nThe children are not pleased with this decision but later coolly agree to it. The children trap their parents in the nursery, where they become prey to the lions. They later have lunch on the veldt with the child psychologist. They then see the lions feasting but do not recognize what has happened.\nThe crew of a space ship drift helplessly through space after their craft malfunctions. The story describes the final thoughts and conversations of the crew members as they face their death. The narrator bitterly reflects on his life and feels he has accomplished nothing worthwhile. His final thought is a wish that his life would at least be worth something to someone else. As he falls through Earth's atmosphere and is incinerated, he appears as a shooting star to a child in Illinois.\nMars has been colonized solely by black people. When they learn that a rocket is coming from Earth with white travellers, they institute a Jim Crow system of racial segregation in retaliation for how the whites once treated them. When the rocket lands, the travelers tell them that the entire Earth has been destroyed by war, including all of the horrific mementos of racism (such as trees used for lynching black people), leaving few survivors. The black people take pity on the white travelers and accept them into their new society.\nA husband and wife living by a highway in rural Mexico live their simple, regimented lives while the highway fills with refugees of a nuclear war. They give assistance to some young travellers, who tell them that the nuclear war means the end of the world. After the travellers leave, the husband wonders what they meant by \"the world\", before returning to his work as normal.\nSpace explorers find a planet where the population is in a state of bliss. Upon investigation, they discover that an enigmatic visitor came to them, whom the spacemen come to believe is Jesus. One decides to spend his life rejoicing in the man's glory. Another uses the spaceship to try to catch up to the mysterious traveller, but at each planet he finds that \"He\" has just left after spreading his message. Other members of the crew remain on the planet to learn from the contented citizens, and are rewarded by the discovery that \"He\" is still on the planet.\nA group of astronauts is stranded on Venus, where it rains continually and heavily. The travellers make their way across the Venusian landscape to find a \"sun dome\", a shelter with a large artificial light source. The first sun dome they find has been destroyed by the native Venusians. Searching for another sun dome, the characters, one by one, are driven to madness and suicide by the unrelenting rhythm of the rain. At the end of the story, only one astronaut, his sanity in question, remains to find a functional sun dome.\nAstronauts are few in numbers because they all start to get really sick. One day when and astronaut lands he finds out that he has contracted this disease. The disease then rapidly spreads and causes people to get incredibly sick and become dead living creatures. This then leads to a group of people who must save the world from these living dead creatures.\nA group of priests travels to Mars to act as missionaries to the Martians. They discover that the natives are entities of pure energy. Since they lack corporeal form, they are unable to commit sin, and thus do not need redemption.\nA married couple awaken to the knowledge that the world is going to end that very evening. Nonetheless, they go through their normal routines, knowing and accepting the fact that there is no tomorrow.\nNumerous works of literature are banned and burned on Earth. The deceased authors of these books live in a kind of afterlife on Mars. Though dead, they are still vulnerable in the sense that when all of an author's works are destroyed, the author vanishes permanently. The authors learn that people are coming from Earth, and they stage their retribution. Their efforts are foiled when the astronauts burn the last remaining books, annihilating the entire colony.\nTwo friends in a spaceship, Clemens and Hitchcock, discuss the emptiness and cold of space.

The Higher Power of Lucky is a children's novel written by Susan Patron and illustrated by Matt Phelan.  Released in 2006 by Simon & Schuster, it was awarded the 2007 Newbery Medal.\nControversy has arisen over the book due to the use of the word \"scrotum\" on its first page. A number of school libraries have decided to ban or otherwise censor the book according to a New York Times article. While some accuse the author of attempting \"Howard Stern-type shock treatment\", author Susan Patron described the passage in question as being based on her personal knowledge of a rattlesnake biting a dog's scrotum, as well as an explanation of anatomy for readers 9 to 12 years old.  She appeared on NPR's Talk of the Nation to defend her choice of words.\nThe American Library Association responded to the Times article with a statement regarding the value of the book. The authors of the three Newbery Honor books, Cynthia Lord, Jennifer Holm, and Kirby Larson also supported the \"scrotum\" usage.  The story gained further exposure when the blogosphere chimed in.  Kristen McLean, executive director of the Association of Booksellers for Children, provided the industry's response.\nSimon & Schuster have posted a video on their website where Patron discusses the book and her influences in an interview by fellow Newbery Medalist Cynthia Kadohata. In this video Rick Richter, President and Publisher of the Simon & Schuster Children's Publishing Division, states \"Simon & Schuster ultimately hopes that readers will recognize this wonderful book as a whole, and the charm and innocence of its main character Lucky, and will see beyond one word and the controversy surrounding the book. Susan Patron has written a masterful novel celebrating small town values and we can only hope that her deserved Newbery winner is recognized for the treasure that it truly is.\"\nThe sequel to The Higher Power of Lucky was published on March 10, 2009 by Simon & Schuster. Lucky Breaks includes Lucky's eleventh birthday, and the introduction of another friend in her world.\nThe third and final book in Lucky's Hard Pan Trilogy is Lucky For Good.

Ticktock (1996) is a novel by Dean Koontz.  It is significantly out-of-genre for Koontz: after a typical horror opening, the tone of the plot changes to screwball comedy and the humour increases steadily to the end. The subplot of protagonist Tommy Phan's struggle to reconcile his family's tenacious hold on their Vietnamese roots with his personal desire to be purely American is essential to the plot development.\nUnlike most of Koontz's work, this is a screwball comedy/horror story, in which the comedy gradually outweighs the horror. Serious themes of pagan magic and family conflicts between the ancestral Vietnamese culture and the \"American Dream\" are counterpoised with the crazy comedy reminiscent of the classic comedy movies of the 1930s such as \"Bringing Up Baby\".\nCritical comment is generally positive. Koontz has stated in the Afterword that he wrote the novel partly as a relief from the darker aspects of his work, especially \"Dark Rivers of the Heart\", and partly for the challenge of writing a good screwball comedy.\nKoontz, Dean. \"Ticktock\".

Sharpe's Rifles is chronologically the sixth, but the ninth published, historical novel in the Richard Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell, first published in 1988.\nLieutenant Richard Sharpe is caught up in the French invasion of Galicia, Spain in January 1809.\nRichard Sharpe \u2013 Lieutenant in the 95th Rifles\nPatrick Harper \u2013 One of Sharpe's new riflemen\nCaptain Michael Hogan \u2013 An engineer and one of Wellesley's exploring officers.\nDaniel Hagman\u2013 A rifleman and ex-poacher\nMajor Blas Vivar \u2013 A Spanish officer on a mission\nCount of Mouromorto \u2013 Ally of the French and brother of Blas Vivar\nMajor Warren Dunnett \u2013 Sharpe's commanding officer who is captured by the French\nCaptain Murray \u2013 Sharpe's superior who dies, leaving Sharpe his own sword\nLouisa Parker \u2013 A young Englishwoman whom Sharpe takes a fancy to. She ends up marrying Major Blas Vivar.\nSharpe's Rifles was adapted as the first episode of the Sharpe television series starring Sean Bean as Sharpe, Brian Cox as Hogan and Daragh O'Malley as Harper and guest starring Simon Andreu as Vivar, Julian Fellowes as Major Dunnett and Tim Bentinck as Captain Murray. The adaptation also introduced the character of Teresa Moreno (played by Assumpta Serna), Sharpe's future wife, prior to her introduction in the novels in Sharpe's Gold, as a colleague of Vivar and replaced the company of men from the novels with five key characters: three of these, Hagman (John Tams), Cooper (Michael Mears) and Tongue (Paul Trussell), came from the novel, the other two, Harris (Jason Salkey) and Perkins (Lyndon Davies), were invented. It added an opening sequence of Sharpe saving the life of Sir Arthur Wellesley (David Troughton) and earning a battlefield commission (an event that happened during the Second Mahratta War in the novels). Major Dunnett, who is merely captured in the book, is killed in the opening ambush, as is Sergeant Williams who survives until halfway through in the book. The backdrop of the retreat to Corunna was dropped and instead Sharpe is searching for an army banker, James Rothschild (Kerry Shale). Louisa, the primary love interest from the novel, is reduced to a minor character whose uncle turns out to be a colleague of Hogan and whose \"aunt\" is Rothschild in disguise (in the book she travels with her actual aunt and uncle). Hogan is given a larger role, manipulating Sharpe into assisting Vivar. The death of the primary villain Colonel De L'Eclin is altered slightly: In the book, he hides in Santiago with an army, in the television version, he returns alone to confront Sharpe and is killed by Perkins when he pulls a gun on him.\n1988, UK, HarperCollins ISBN\u00a00-00-223233-2, Pub date\u00a0?

The Higher Power of Lucky is a children's novel written by Susan Patron and illustrated by Matt Phelan.  Released in 2006 by Simon & Schuster, it was awarded the 2007 Newbery Medal.\nControversy has arisen over the book due to the use of the word \"scrotum\" on its first page. A number of school libraries have decided to ban or otherwise censor the book according to a New York Times article. While some accuse the author of attempting \"Howard Stern-type shock treatment\", author Susan Patron described the passage in question as being based on her personal knowledge of a rattlesnake biting a dog's scrotum, as well as an explanation of anatomy for readers 9 to 12 years old.  She appeared on NPR's Talk of the Nation to defend her choice of words.\nThe American Library Association responded to the Times article with a statement regarding the value of the book. The authors of the three Newbery Honor books, Cynthia Lord, Jennifer Holm, and Kirby Larson also supported the \"scrotum\" usage.  The story gained further exposure when the blogosphere chimed in.  Kristen McLean, executive director of the Association of Booksellers for Children, provided the industry's response.\nSimon & Schuster have posted a video on their website where Patron discusses the book and her influences in an interview by fellow Newbery Medalist Cynthia Kadohata. In this video Rick Richter, President and Publisher of the Simon & Schuster Children's Publishing Division, states \"Simon & Schuster ultimately hopes that readers will recognize this wonderful book as a whole, and the charm and innocence of its main character Lucky, and will see beyond one word and the controversy surrounding the book. Susan Patron has written a masterful novel celebrating small town values and we can only hope that her deserved Newbery winner is recognized for the treasure that it truly is.\"\nThe sequel to The Higher Power of Lucky was published on March 10, 2009 by Simon & Schuster. Lucky Breaks includes Lucky's eleventh birthday, and the introduction of another friend in her world.\nThe third and final book in Lucky's Hard Pan Trilogy is Lucky For Good.

The book cover depicts Sune and \"Svarta Mannen\", standing on each side behind an outhouse.\nSune is a 3rd grader at S\u00f6derskolan, and the book opens with depicting the Andersson family. The opening chapter closes with Sune thinking back on what happened during the summer that past behind, when he was to a summer camp. The book then jumps backwards, depicting Sune and Joakim going to camp, for Sune it's the first time and he has been to a hike before and thinks it'll be fun, but Joakim has been to hikes before. The camp lasts for six days, and is split up in different hikes with circa 60 children aged 6\u201314. Sune and Joakim are to canoeing, and Joakim says there are crocodiles in the water, who have to be hit with the paddle, and when Sune says no crocodiles exist in Sweden Joakim insists. Joakim's mother Siw drives Sune and Joakim in a car to \"Byholmen\", a place in the woodlands where the camp will occur. Rumors say \"Svarta Mannen\" (\"Dark Man\") is there, pulls up tent pegs, frightens children with \"heml\u00e4ngtanbaciller\" (\"homesickness bacilli\") and poisons the food. Sune thinks maybe camp leader Ulrik Bengtsson is Svarta Mannen. At the camp are also Simon, Jannika and Mirriam. During the first evening, twilight falls och Sune means he has seen Svarta Mannen in the woods, but camp manager Britt-Marie R\u00e4vberg says he doesn't exist, that it's just imagination and that homesickness can affect anyone. Sune now realizes that Joakim has made up the Svarta Mannen to avoid confessing his own homesickness. During the rest of the weak everything is fun, nobody talks of Svarta Mannen and not even when the canoe turns over hand his hair is filled with seagrass, Sune longs home.\nThe book then continues with depicting Sune and Sophie kissing each other alone, when H\u00e5kan and P\u00e4r try to spy. They start a club, with the only ambition to reveal what Sunes and Sophie do. When Sune and Sophie are gone, H\u00e5kan and P\u00e4r hide in the wardrobe with a camera and a tape recorder. Sune and Sophie hear snoring from the wardrobe, and Sune think it's Svarta Mannen, but instead it's H\u00e5kan and P\u00e4r who have fallen asleep, and since that day, Sune and Sophie always check out the wardrobe first.\nIn the autumn, the Andersson family go on a trip to an old castle to learn more history. Anna is not allowed to bring her boyfriend Lars-Olof. A bus appears and drops off schoolchildren next to a petrol station where the Andersson family stop, and Sune shows interest for \u00c5sa Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sa, who gives Sune a blown kiss. Sune offers Svenne (in the bus) two ice cream to change place, and Sune jumps into the bus, and Svenne goes into the Andersson family's car. Everything is revealed, Karin and Rudolf signal to the bus driver, who stops the bus. The trip continues, but is never depicted.\nWhen it's Sophie's birthday, Sune goes by bus into town to buy a present. After first believing he has ended up at the concert hall instead, as a man plays the accordion, he soon learns he is at the right place, the department store. Sune goes to a toy store where two guys check a cap gun that Sune purchases, and forgets the money for Sophie's present, a pink cloth cat. Sune steals the cloth cat and puts it in his inner jacket pocket, when discovering the store using camera surveillance. Sune is ashamed, but pays for the cap gun and nobody notices him stealing the cloth cat. Sune takes the bus home, and rings on Sophie' s doorbell and says he stole the cloth cat, while Sophie means he's a criminal, is ashamed and believes he will end up in prison. Sophie declares that's not the case, but stealing is outlawed in Sweden and that Sophie tells him to return the cloth chat, that she doesn't want. She also wants him to never do it again, or else she'll not be his best friend anymore. Sophie goes with him, and gives the table cloth and the cap gun to the store manager, so he can buy the cloth cat. The store manager pays he difference, five kronor, for Sune being \"honest and brave\", and having \"such a kind and clever girlfriend .\nWhen Saint Lucy's Day approaches, Sune puts a boot as a star boy hat, and sings \"Sankta Lucia, sk\u00e4nk mig en tia. Tian var trasig, lucian var knasig\" (\"Saint Lucy, give me 10 crowns. The 10 crown bill was broken, Saint Lucy was scatty \"). The music teacher runs towards Sune and tells him to take the boot off, he doesn't need to wear a star boy hat. But when singing \"Staffan var en stolledr\u00e4ng\" (\"Stephen was a fooly farmworker boy\") he is sent to the classroom to draw, and soon the other students arrive to do Christmas decoration.

Necropolis is a fantasy novel by British writer Anthony Horowitz. It is the fourth novel in his The Power of Five series. The book is set in London, Peru, Miami, Ukraine, Macau and Hong Kong. The book was released in the United Kingdom and Australia on 30 October 2008. It is a rewrite of the corresponding Day of the Dragon, released in 1989 as part of Horowitz's Pentagram series. A noteworthy difference from the original novel is the change of the lead character Will Tyler to a female counterpart called Scarlett Adams, Horowitz's first female hero. According to Horowitz, this change resulted a complete rewrite of the original. Before Christmas 2008, the book had sold 190,000 copies worldwide.\nNecropolis signifies a change in the structure of the narrative of The Power of Five series, with two characters' tales being told side by side. It also sees the Gatekeepers actively seeking each other for the first time.\nAll five children have turned fifteen between Nightrise and Necropolis but, although Matt mentions his own birthday occurred while he was in Nazca, it is not explicitly mentioned if the Five were born on the same day.\nThis novel displays how the Nightrise Corporation underestimate the Gatekeepers; they presumed that Scarlett would still be living in China. But she turns out to be in London, England.\nThis is also the first novel in the series which prominently features a somewhat divine opposition against the Old Ones, with the introduction of the Librarian. The Librarian's role is brief and never elaborated upon, but it is made clear the Librarian has vast power. It is obvious he is there to combat the Old Ones. This marks a significant change because in the first three novels the Old Ones had seemingly invincible power and the Five had to face them themselves with no help.\nThe final chapter of Nightrise, which introduced modern-day Scarlett, is significantly revised in this novel, her disappearance having occurred beforehand.\nPedro, who could not speak a word of English previously in the series, has apparently learned a sufficient amount of the language for communication purposes in the four months since the events of Evil Star. Again, this is not explicitly referred to in the narrative.\nIn Raven's Gate, Matt claimed he never smoked when Claire Deverill came over for dinner. However, in Necropolis, when he introduces himself in his diary, he claims that he had smoked with Kelvin Johnson but withdrew after his arrest. Matt hated and feared Deverill, and so may simply have lied to her. It is unlikely he would have felt any compunction about doing so.\nNecropolis is a re-write of the 1989 novel Day of the Dragon, which is part of Horowitz\u2019s unfinished Pentagram series. Apart from the gender-swapping of Will Tyler to Scarlet Adams, the main differences between Day of the Dragon and Necropolis are seen through the extended introductions in both Matt and Scarlett's strands of narrative and the ending in the latter novel. In Day of the Dragon, only two of the five Gatekeepers, Martin and Will (the equivalents of Matt and Scarlett respectively), had met up and escaped but, in contrast to Necropolis, without being scattered across the world, and without one of them being shot. \nIn a reference to the earlier Pentagram novels, Matt and Jamie travel under the names Martin Hopkins and Nicholas Helsey respectively, their names from the Pentagram series. Conversely, Richard Cole does not use the false name Abram Stitchkins.\nIn the second book, Evil Star, when Matt visits Nexus, the member Dravid has been replaced, so there are twelve members again. However, in Necropolis, neither he nor Fabian has been replaced and there are only ten members.\nIt is revealed that the motto of the Nightrise Corporation is: Ja sakkath, Jak sakkakh, Ja sha xul.\nOne of the epithets for the Old Ones was Anasazi. That is a Native American tribe.\nJ. Naish,Anthony Horowitz: why I'm writing about girls, 28 November 2008.\nThe Power of Five official website"

Necropolis is a fantasy novel by British writer Anthony Horowitz. It is the fourth novel in his The Power of Five series. The book is set in London, Peru, Miami, Ukraine, Macau and Hong Kong. The book was released in the United Kingdom and Australia on 30 October 2008. It is a rewrite of the corresponding Day of the Dragon, released in 1989 as part of Horowitz's Pentagram series. A noteworthy difference from the original novel is the change of the lead character Will Tyler to a female counterpart called Scarlett Adams, Horowitz's first female hero. According to Horowitz, this change resulted a complete rewrite of the original. Before Christmas 2008, the book had sold 190,000 copies worldwide.\nNecropolis signifies a change in the structure of the narrative of The Power of Five series, with two characters' tales being told side by side. It also sees the Gatekeepers actively seeking each other for the first time.\nAll five children have turned fifteen between Nightrise and Necropolis but, although Matt mentions his own birthday occurred while he was in Nazca, it is not explicitly mentioned if the Five were born on the same day.\nThis novel displays how the Nightrise Corporation underestimate the Gatekeepers; they presumed that Scarlett would still be living in China. But she turns out to be in London, England.\nThis is also the first novel in the series which prominently features a somewhat divine opposition against the Old Ones, with the introduction of the Librarian. The Librarian's role is brief and never elaborated upon, but it is made clear the Librarian has vast power. It is obvious he is there to combat the Old Ones. This marks a significant change because in the first three novels the Old Ones had seemingly invincible power and the Five had to face them themselves with no help.\nThe final chapter of Nightrise, which introduced modern-day Scarlett, is significantly revised in this novel, her disappearance having occurred beforehand.\nPedro, who could not speak a word of English previously in the series, has apparently learned a sufficient amount of the language for communication purposes in the four months since the events of Evil Star. Again, this is not explicitly referred to in the narrative.\nIn Raven's Gate, Matt claimed he never smoked when Claire Deverill came over for dinner. However, in Necropolis, when he introduces himself in his diary, he claims that he had smoked with Kelvin Johnson but withdrew after his arrest. Matt hated and feared Deverill, and so may simply have lied to her. It is unlikely he would have felt any compunction about doing so.\nNecropolis is a re-write of the 1989 novel Day of the Dragon, which is part of Horowitz\u2019s unfinished Pentagram series. Apart from the gender-swapping of Will Tyler to Scarlet Adams, the main differences between Day of the Dragon and Necropolis are seen through the extended introductions in both Matt and Scarlett's strands of narrative and the ending in the latter novel. In Day of the Dragon, only two of the five Gatekeepers, Martin and Will (the equivalents of Matt and Scarlett respectively), had met up and escaped but, in contrast to Necropolis, without being scattered across the world, and without one of them being shot. \nIn a reference to the earlier Pentagram novels, Matt and Jamie travel under the names Martin Hopkins and Nicholas Helsey respectively, their names from the Pentagram series. Conversely, Richard Cole does not use the false name Abram Stitchkins.\nIn the second book, Evil Star, when Matt visits Nexus, the member Dravid has been replaced, so there are twelve members again. However, in Necropolis, neither he nor Fabian has been replaced and there are only ten members.\nIt is revealed that the motto of the Nightrise Corporation is: Ja sakkath, Jak sakkakh, Ja sha xul.\nOne of the epithets for the Old Ones was Anasazi. That is a Native American tribe.\nJ. Naish,Anthony Horowitz: why I'm writing about girls, 28 November 2008.\nThe Power of Five official website"

The plot revolves around the Melekhov family of Tatarsk, who are descendants of a cossack who, to the horror of many, took a Turkish captive as a wife during the Crimean War. She is accused of witchcraft by Melekhov's superstitious neighbors, who attempt to kill her but are fought off by her husband. Their descendants, the son and grandsons, who are the protagonists of the story, are therefore often nicknamed \"Turks\". Nevertheless, they command a high level of respect among people in Tatarsk. ...",

And Quiet Flows the Don (Quiet Flows the Don or  The Silent Don, Russian: \u0422\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u043e\u043d, literally The Quiet Don) is a novel in four volumes by Russian writer Mikhail Sholokhov. The first three volumes were written from 1925 to 1932 and published in the Soviet magazine Oktyabr in 1928\u20131932, and the fourth volume was finished in 1940. The English translation by Stephen Garry of the first two volumes appeared under the title And Quiet Flows the Don in 1934, while other two were published in 1940 as The Don Flows Home to the Sea. The whole work was published as a set of two books under the title The Silent Don. Garry's traslation lacks about 25 percent of the novel text. In 1950 Garry's translation was \"revised and completed\" by Robert Daglish. In 1984 Daglish published his own translation of the novel as Quiet Flows the Don.\nThe novel is considered one of the most significant works of world and Russian literature in the 20th century. It depicts the lives and struggles of Don Cossacks during the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and Russian Civil War. In 1965, Sholokhov was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for this novel.\nThe novel has been compared to War and Peace (1869), written by Leo Tolstoy, notably by Maxim Gorky.  Like the Tolstoy novel, And Quiet Flows the Don is an epic picture of Russian life during a time of crisis and examines it through political, military, romantic, and civilian lenses. Sholokhov was accused by Solzhenitsyn and others, amongst them Svetlana Alliluyeva (the daughter of Stalin) and Natalia Belinkova, wife of Arkadiy Belinkov, of plagiarizing the novel. An investigation in the late 1920s had upheld Sholokhov's authorship of \"Silent Don\" and the allegations were denounced as malicious slander in Pravda.\nDuring the Second World War, Sholokhov's archive was destroyed in a bomb raid, and only the fourth volume survived. Sholokhov had his friend Vassily Kudashov, who was killed in the war, look after it. Following Kudashov's death, his widow took possession of the manuscript, but she never disclosed the fact of owning it. The manuscript was finally found by the Institute of World Literature of Russian Academy of Sciences in 1999 with assistance from the Russian Government. The writing paper dates back to the 1920s: 605 pages are in Sholokhov's own hand, evidencing considerable re-drafting and re-organising of the material by Sholokhov, and 285 are transcribed by his wife Maria and sisters.\nStatistical analysis of sentence lengths in And Quiet Flows the Don gives full support to Sholokhov.\nThe novel won the Stalin Prize in 1941 and its author won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1965.\nThe novel has been adapted for the screen four times: a 1931 film by Ivan Pravov and Olga Preobrazhenskaya; a second, 1958 adaption was directed by Sergei Gerasimov and starred Elina Bystritskaya and Pyotr Glebov. In 1992\u20131993 a remake was directed by Sergei Bondarchuk (starring Rupert Everett); the film was not finished until 2006, when Fyodor Bondarchuk completed the editing, and was shown on Russian television as a seven-part miniseries. A shorter, 3-hours version of Bondarchuk's And Quiet Flows the Don was released on DVD in several countries. In 2015 the novel has been adapted again more comprehensively as a 14-part TV-series, directed by Sergey Ursulyak.\nIvan Dzerzhinsky based his opera Quiet Flows the Don (Tikhiy Don) on the novel, with the libretto adapted by his brother Leonid. Premiered in October 1935, it became wildly popular after Stalin saw and praised it a few months later. The opera was proclaimed a model of socialist realism in music and won Dzerzhinsky a Stalin Prize.\nThe lyrics for the folk song \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\" by Pete Seeger and Joe Hickerson were adapted from the cossack folk \"Koloda duda\" (Ukrainian: \"\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u0434\u0430\") song sung by Daria in And Quiet Flows the Don Part 1, Chapter 3 (page 17 Knopf edition).\nAnd Quiet Flows the Don.

Doomed Queen Anne is a young-adult historical novel about Anne Boleyn by Carolyn Meyer. It is the third book in the Young Royals series. Other books are Mary, Bloody Mary, Beware, Princess Elizabeth and Patience, Princess Catherine. The book was originally published in the U.S. in 2002 by Harcourt/Gulliver Books (now Houghton Mifflin Harcourt).\nIn this novel the birthdates of the Boleyn children are 1502 (Mary), 1507 (Anne), and 1509 (George). Historians now believe the years of birth to be 1499 for Mary, 1504 for George, and either 1501 or 1507 for Anne.\nIn the novel, Mary becomes the king's mistress around 1520, sometime prior to the \"Field of the Cloth of Gold\". She is also presented as being married after the affair begins. In reality, Mary was married in February 1520, and embarked on her affair around 1521/1522. There is no evidence of her ever being sexually active with Henry VIII before her marriage to William Carey.\nThe book presents Anne as having \"deformities\" (sixth finger, mole on her neck). These \"defects\" were not ever mentioned by anyone who knew her throughout her lifetime. The first report of Anne Boleyn having any kind of deformity was brought up by Nicholas Sanders, long after her death. Sanders never met or saw her, being a young child when she died. His claim that Anne had the extra finger and mole was certainly just a false claim designed to slander her after her death.\nThe novel displays Mary as being a great beauty, the family favorite. This is untrue. Mary was sent to France in 1514. During her stay, she became known for her promiscuity. She had a number of affairs with King Francis and his courtiers. The French king himself referred to her as \"a great prostitute, infamous above all,\" \"the English mare,\" and \"my hackney.\" Mary was sent away from the French court in 1519 for her promiscuous behavior, in disgrace. (Said affairs go unmentioned in the novel.) Her family was horrified. Thomas Boleyn managed to marry her off to a minor courtier a year later. There is no evidence that Mary was extraordinarily beautiful since there are no contemporary descriptions or paintings of her. In fact, there are descriptions of Anne Boleyn as a great beauty with captivating eyes.\nAnne's parents would not have considered sending her to a nunnery because of her \"defects\"; as mentioned before, she had none. When she was sent abroad, it was for special education. The position Anne's parents secured for her in the Netherlands and France were greatly sought after.\nMary did marry a commoner in 1534. Her family was furious, and the king had her banished from court. Mary's statement \"I would rather beg my bread with him than be the finest queen ever christened\", was not something she told her sister. It was written in a letter to Thomas Cromwell. When Mary was having financial trouble, Anne assisted her by sending a golden cup and some money. These actions are never mentioned in the book.\nSome time in November 1532, Anne and Henry were married in Calais. Anne did not sleep with Henry before she was wed. They were later remarried on English soil on January 25 when she was found to be pregnant.\nHistorically, Anne was an affectionate mother to Elizabeth, while in the novel, she simply wants a son to please Henry and hardly ever sees her daughter.\nThe book depicts Henry's daughter Mary by Catherine of Aragon as having been summoned to Greenwich Palace to witness the birth of Elizabeth because tradition requires it. She is then subsequently forced to perform several tedious and indignant tasks for Anne, which is merely \"a means of passing the time.\" However, none of this happened in reality because Mary Tudor was living at Richmond at the time.\nAnne did not seduce the king into marrying her. When she attracted the king it was unintentional. She was not jealous of her sister's affair. In fact, she was rather horrified by Mary's actions.\nAt the end, while Anne is awaiting execution, she narrates that while Catherine of Aragon had many supporters during her time of trouble, she had none. Actually, she did have friends at court, among them Thomas Wyatt, Margaret Wyatt, Francis Weston, and others. She was supported by other leading Reformers, including Martin Luther and Marguerite of France. While Anne was largely unpopular with the English common folk during most of her reign, the sympathy of the people shifted to her when the accusations were formed as they were so outrageous that even her enemy Eustace Chapuys was incredulous.\nAnne's charity works also goes unmentioned.

The Boleyn Inheritance is a novel by British author Philippa Gregory which was first published in 2006. It is a direct sequel to her previous novel The Other Boleyn Girl, and one of the additions to her six-part series on the Tudor royals. (The other titles in the series are The Constant Princess, The Queen's Fool, The Virgin's Lover, and The Other Queen.)* The novel is told through the first-person narratives of \u2013 Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Jane Boleyn, who was mentioned in The Other Boleyn Girl. It covers a period from 1539 until 1542 and chronicles the fourth and fifth marriages of King Henry VIII of England.\nIn reviewing the book, Publishers Weekly wrote \"Gregory's accounts of events are accurate enough to be persuasive, her characterizations modern enough to be convincing. Rich in intrigue and irony, this is a tale where readers will already know who was divorced, beheaded or survived, but will savor Gregory's sharp staging of how and why.\" The Historical Novel Society review summarized the book as \"Beautifully drawn characters, glorious storytelling \u2013 a tour de force from Philippa Gregory and a must read.\"\nIn a 2006 book review in Kirkus Reviews the review summarized; \"Royal history spoon-fed in a highly digestible form.\"\nMary Boleyn's daughter, Catherine, is referred to as Catherine Carey throughout the book. However, she married Francis Knollys in 1539 and would have been called Lady Catherine Knollys.\nThere is no evidence that Jane faked insanity to save her life. She was, however, insane when she was executed, and King Henry VIII repealed a law that said that insane people could not be executed.\nJane and George Boleyn did not have a son. There is no contemporary mention of them having children. That rumour comes from the later prominence of George Boleyn, the dean of Lichfield, who was probably a distant cousin. If they had had a son, he would have inherited the titles of Earl of Ormonde and Earl of Wiltshire. Instead, the inheritance went to the crown since there were no male heirs left from Thomas and Elizabeth Boleyn, and Henry passed the funds along to Mary Boleyn.\nIn the book, when Jane Boleyn returns to the Queen's service she mentions being at Greenwich Palace and the last occasion she was there was when she nursed the dying Jane Seymour. Jane Seymour, in fact, died at Hampton Court. Her son, the future Edward VI, died at Greenwich fifteen years later.\nIn the novel, once Katherine Howard is told by her uncle that she is to be sent to court, she promptly ends her affair with Francis Dereham and finds her desire to go is apparently stronger than her love for him. When he comes to her that night, she orders him away. Francis Dereham was not really in the same place as Katherine Howard when she was given the opportunity to go to court. He was away travelling and was not informed of her absence at the home of the dowager duchess until after his return.\nIn the book, Jane and the Duke of Norfolk plot to put Katherine on the throne. However, there is no evidence that they even talked after the fall of Anne Boleyn. The Duke of Norfolk, after the tragedy of his niece, Anne Boleyn, is highly unlikely to have played such a dangerous game.\nAnne of Cleves's mother was not cruel to her. On the contrary, Anne was said to be her favourite.\nIn the novel, Jane is said to be 30 in 1539, meaning she would have to have been born sometime in 1509. However, it is more likely that she was born in 1505 and so was 34 in 1539.\nIn the book, Katherine Howard was said to be extremely beautiful, and as she herself says, that she \"was the most beautiful girl in England\"). In reality, Katherine Howard was said to be only \"moderately beautiful\" but youthful looking.\nIn the book, Katherine Howard is 14 when she comes to court. Although her exact date of birth is not known, the most common date given is 1521, and she would actually have been in her late teens when she came to court.\nIn the book, Anne of Cleves is elated to be free from her marriage and is horrified at the idea of remarrying the King. In reality, she agreed to the annulment, but she had hopes of becoming Queen again after the execution of Katherine Howard and was said to be quite unhappy on learning that the King was marrying Katherine Parr. Years after the King died, she attempted to have their marriage declared valid so that she could enjoy the advantages of being Queen Dowager.\nIn the book, Henry's eldest daughter Mary I of England is openly referred to as Princess Mary, but in reality, she was then legally"

The book's main character is Kevin Lewis, an MIT graduate who was invited to join the MIT Blackjack Team in 1993. Lewis was recruited by two of the team's top players, Jason Fisher and Andre Martinez. The team was financed by a colorful character named Micky Rosa, who had organized at least one other team to play the Vegas strip. This new team was the most profitable yet. Personality conflicts and card counting deterrent efforts at the casinos eventually ended this incarnation of the MIT Blackjack Team.\n\nAlthough not revealed in the book, Kevin Lewis's real name is Jeff Ma, an MIT student who graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1994. Ma has since gone on to found a fantasy sports company called Citizen Sports (a stock market simulation game).\nMezrich acknowledges that Lewis is the sole major character based on a single, real-life individual; other characters are composites. Nonetheless, Lewis does things in the book that Ma himself says did not occur.\nOne of the leaders of the team, Jason Fisher, is modeled in part after Mike Aponte. After his professional card counting career, Aponte went on to win the 2004 World Series of Blackjack, and started a company called the Blackjack Institute. Mike also has his own blog.\nThe team's principal leader, Micky Rosa is a composite character based primarily on Bill Kaplan, JP Massar, and John Chang. Bill Kaplan founded and led the MIT Blackjack Team in the 1980s and co-managed the team with Massar and Chang from 1992 to 1993, during which time Jeff Ma joined the then nearly 80 person team. Chang has questioned the book's veracity, telling The Boston Globe, \"I don't even know if you want to call the things in there exaggerations, because they're so exaggerated they're basically untrue.\" Whether the MIT Blackjack Team was \"founded ... in the 1980s\" is in dispute. An article in The Tech, January 16, 1980, suggests that Roger Demaree and JP Massar were already running the team and teaching a hundred MIT students to play blackjack by the third week of the 1980s, implying that the team had been founded in the late 1970s, before Kaplan joined, although Demaree and Massar have mostly avoided publicity.\n\nIn its March 2008 edition, Boston magazine ran an article investigating long-lingering claims that the book was substantially fictional.The Boston Globe followed up with a more detailed story on April 6, 2008.\nThough published as a factual account and originally categorized under \"Current Events\" in the hardcover Free Press edition, Bringing Down the House \"is not a work of 'nonfiction' in any meaningful sense of the word,\" according to Globe reporter Drake Bennett. Mezrich not only exaggerated freely, according to sources for both articles, but invented whole parts of the story, including some pivotal events in the book that never happened to anyone.\nThe book contains the following disclaimer:\nThe names of many of the characters and locations in this book have been changed, as have certain physical characteristics and other descriptive details. Some of the events and characters are also composites of several individual events or persons.\nThis disclaimer allows broad leeway to take real events and real people and alter them in any way the author sees fit. But Mezrich went further, both articles say.\nThe following events described in Bringing Down the House did not occur:\nUnderground Chinatown Casino. The underground casino used for Kevin's final test (pp.\u00a055\u201359) is entirely imaginary, according to Mike Aponte and Dave Irvine.\nUse of Strippers to Cash Out Chips. Also according to Aponte and Irvine, strippers were never recruited to cash out the team's chips, as described on pp.\u00a0149\u2013153.\nShadowy Investors. The \"shadowy investors\" first referenced on p.\u00a03 are a major source of intrigue for Mezrich's story, but did not exist, according to Aponte and Irvine. The investors in the team included the players, one of Kaplan's college roommates, a few of Kaplan's Harvard Business School section mates, and Kaplan's friends and family members.\nPhysical Assault. The scene in which Fisher is beaten up (pp.\u00a0221\u2013225) is imaginary. \"No one was ever beaten up,\" according to Aponte and Irvine. Moreover, Jeff Ma claims they have never been roughed up by the casinos they played in. Still there were times when casino employees had tried to intimidate the members of the team.\nPlayer Forced to Swallow Chip. In a scene on pp.\u00a0215\u2013218, Micky Rosa recounts a story in which Vincent Cole\u2014a private investigator for Plymouth Investigations\u2014forces a member of a count team to swallow a purple casino chip while detaining the player in a back room.

He explains that the rationale for this theoretical enterprise is rooted in the human desire to understand the \u201cmeaning of life,\u201d specifically, the nature of the bond between the self and the world. Unger contends that the contemporary human moral experience is one of division, between a side of the self that maintains allegiance to the dominant theoretical and political regimes of society, and another side that is drawn to ideals that current modes of thought reject. Under this experience of division, Unger contends, human experience demands \u201ctotal criticism\u201d of the kind he intends to apply to the doctrine of liberalism.\nUnger describes classical liberal doctrine as both a ruling consciousness of society and a metaphysical system, a system of ideas which involves a particular organization of moral sentiments. In human moral experience, liberalism's failure to satisfy the ideal of the self (which Unger later describes as the fullest expression of man's species nature) is experienced as the twin evils of resignation and disintegration. The early liberal thinkers and the classic social theorists understood the radical separations that mark human life, between self and nature, self and others, self and its own roles and works. By undertaking a total criticism of liberal doctrine, particularly by repudiating its distinction between reason and desire, and Unger intends to lay the groundwork for his positive program, the nonliberal social theory that would help to overcome these divisions and give full expression to a range of human feelings and ideas.\n\nThe liberal doctrines of mind and society rejected the medieval view of knowledge which held that all things in nature have intelligible essences. Under the doctrine of intelligible essences, everything can be classified under the word that names its category. Liberal thinkers, in rejecting the doctrine of intelligible essences, realized that there is an infinite number of ways objects and events can be classified, infinite ways the world can be divided up by the mind. Liberalism's rejection of the doctrine of intelligible essences had far-reaching consequences for moral and political views. The rejection of intelligible essences also led to the antinomy of theory and fact, a seemingly insoluble conflict between two ideas that seemed equally plausible but led to equally absurd consequences. The antinomy of theory and fact is the conflict between, on the one hand, the realization that all understanding of facts is mediated by theory, and on the other hand, the belief in an independent comparison of theory and fact. Faced with the antinomy of theory and fact, we ask: how can we assess the power of competing theories, if there is no appeal to facts independently of theories? Kant's metaphysics offered a promising and ingenious solution\u2014namely, locating the source of the antinomy in the division of universal and particular, form and substance, in human thought. The division between the universal and particular is at the heart of the contradictions of liberal thought.\nUnger describes the \u201cunreflective view of mind\u201d that characterizes liberal psychology. According to this unreflective view of mind, the mind is a machine that perceives and understands facts (object-events) through sensations. These sensations can be combined, or split until they are indivisible. Combining sensations does not change them. Facts that have been combined can be analyzed back into their constituent sensations. Hobbes explained that desire is what impels the \u201cmind-machine\u201d to its operations of combination and analysis. What leads desire to choose one course of action over another is the desire to seek pleasure and avoid pain. This account of liberal doctrine's unreflective view of the mind can be reduced to three principles:\nThe principle of reason and desire. The principle that the self is divided between desire, which is the active, desiring, moving part of the self, and understanding, which is the knowing part of the self. The understanding wants nothing; desire can see nothing. What distinguishes human beings is that they desire different things, not that they understand the world differently.\nThe principle of arbitrary desire. This principle holds that desires are arbitrary from the perspective of the understanding. We cannot determine what we should want simply by learning more about the world."

In False Necessity, Unger presents both an explanatory theory of society and a program for the reform of society as a radical democracy that respects the ability of human beings continually to outreach, subvert, and remake their contexts. Unger proposes an \"empowered democracy\" that is structured so that it is maximally open to revision, a form of organization Unger calls \"structure-revising structure.\" As Unger explains, \"[a]s an explanatory theory of society, False Necessity seeks to free social explanation from dependence upon the denial of our freedom to resist and to remake  our forms of social life. It carries to extremes the thesis that everything in society is politics, mere politics....\" Unger argues that \"the best hope for the advancement of the radical cause\u2014the cause that leftists share with liberals\u2014lies in a series of revolutionary reforms in the organization of governments and economies and in the character of our personal relations.\"\nThe explanatory theory in False Necessity focuses on cycles of reform and retrenchment in the West after World War II\u2014particularly the repetitive nature of ordinary social conflict\u2014in which there seem to be few options for major social change. Radical reform movements seem inevitably to fail even when they manage to achieve control of the government, due to a combination of business disinvestment and the bickering and jockeying for advantage among different groups of workers. Unger advances a hypothesis and analysis of a formative contexts that explains these stubborn cycles of reform and retrenchment. Formative contexts include the institutional arrangements and imaginative presuppositions that shape people\u2019s routines, and give certain groups mastery over the wealth, power, and knowledge in society. Unger lays a groundwork for the programmatic argument by analyzing certain possibilities in the state and in the microstructure of society\u2014the extension of rights to guarantee the inviolability of the individual against government oppression and to meet basic material needs; the patron-client relationship as an example of a replacement of the impersonal by the personal; and a flexible variant of rationalized collective labor as a mode of work organization that breaks down the barrier between task-definers and task-executors in the workplace. Unger employs the concept of negative capability to describe the quality of freedom that emerges from liberating ourselves from rigid roles and hierarchies that compose part of society's formative contexts, and notes that one limitation on remaking contexts is the difficulty of combining institutions embodying different levels of negative cability into a single context. Unger concludes the explanatory section by setting forth an institutional genealogy of contemporary formative contexts and a theory of context making, both of which offer insight that can be used in remaking society.\nIn the programmatic section of False Necessity, Unger seeks to merge the modernist visionary's criticism of personal relations with the leftist's critique of collective institutions, in a program for empowered democracy. Despite the natural affinity between modernism and leftism, according to Unger, these two movements have been separated for too long, to the detriment of transformative politics. Unger justifies empowered democracy as the system that will embody the \"superliberalism\" that Unger sees as the surest way to bring about human empowerment, in a state that is not hostage to faction and where society is an artifact of will, not a product of institutional fetishism adhering to past compromises and outmoded institutions. Unger describes the \"transformative movement\" in its quest for empowered democracy, and sketches the principles that would inform the empowered democracy as he envisions it: institutions that are less plagued by deadlock, that decentralize the exercise of power, that represent overlapping functions, and are designed to lead to swift resolution of impasse. The institutions that embody these principles include a rotating capital fund giving broad access to society's investment capital to teams of workers, a series of innovative rights (such as market rights, immunity rights, destabilization rights, and solidarity rights) that guarantee the individual's dignity, security, and right to participate fully in the economy and government of society and would be enforced by government departments charged with intervening to destabilize unjust accumulations of wealth and"

Sir Percy is then captured and imprisoned by Chauvelin and Heron in the cell that was home to Marie Antoinette in her last days.\nChauvelin insists that Percy is to be deprived of sleep in the hope that he will be weakened and disclose where young Capet, the uncrowned King of France, is being held following his rescue.\nAfter 17 days in prison, Percy is sure that the dauphin has been transported safely into Holland. He then contrives, by pretending to crack and confess the dauphin's whereabouts, to make his escape. He tells Chauvelin and Heron that the dauphin is being held in an area in the north, near the coast of France, but that he has to show them, rather than tell them, because the paths are nameless and too small for them to find without him.\nChauvelin and Heron, skeptical, bring along Armand and Marguerite as hostages. Once in the north, Percy takes advantage of a chance when Chauvelin and Heron are separated, and darkness, to subdue Heron, bind and truss him, put on his clothes, and direct the guileless French soldiers (who think that the bound Heron is Percy) to put him in the gated yard of a church. Percy, still thought to be Heron, drives a carriage with Marguerite and Armand inside to the coast, where his ship is waiting for them.\nEldorado at Standard Ebooks\n El Dorado public domain audiobook at LibriVox"

T. J. Miedema wrote in an overview article of the myth in the 1950s that Slauerhoff is \"less of a po\u00e8te maudit fighting against God\" than some of his contemporaries who used the theme. The theme was familiar to Slauerhoff, who had written a Flying Dutchman poem already before 1922. Whereas other Dutch poets were inspired more by German Romanticism (particularly Richard Wagner's Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder, based on a short story by Heinrich Heine), Slauerhoff arrived by way of French poets who treated the related themes of the eternal ghost ship and the dead albatross. For instance, his Rimbaud-inspired \"Het eeuwige schip\" had been published in 1925 already, and before 1922 he had translated Charles Baudelaire's \"L'Albatros\". Literary critic S. P. Uri considers \"Spookschip\", which makes no overt reference to the theme, a better poem than \"The vliegende Hollander\"; like his other poems that treat the theme implicitly, it is a \"strong visionary and symbolic poem, filled with typical Romantic feelings of demise, death, and decomposition\". By contrast, he treats the theme in the overt \"Flying Dutchman\" almost satirically, in \"forced language and sloppy rhymes\". Uri surmises that perhaps Slauerhoff, who was never interested in \"typical Dutch fare\", chose to focus on the French Romantic aspects of the myth rather than the Dutch, Calvinist ones.\nCorbi\u00e8re is cited as one of Slauerhoff's influences and in his early years he had identified with the French po\u00e8te maudit.\nFirst published in 1928 by C. A. J. van Dishoeck in Bussum, it was printed twice more by the same publisher (1942, 1946). It was published (unchanged) in 1982 by Nijgh & Van Ditmar as part of Slauerhoff's collected poetic works.\nJ. C. Bloem (in De Gids, 1929) compared the poem \"Afrikaansche elegy\" (\"African elegy\"), which opens the second section, with the work of Charles Baudelaire (esp. \"Parfum Exotique\"); Bloem made his comparison in an overview of new Dutch poets whose \"raw, jarring, and purposely unpolished\" poetry had its flaws but was a welcome change from over-stylized predecessors. Raymond Herreman (Den Gulden Winckel, 1929) praised Slauerhoff for being a young Dutch poets who reacts strongly against two different tendencies he saw in contemporary poetry\u2014a \"verbose and hollow romanticism\" that attempted to ingest the entire cosmos and was ready to explode, and a school that childishly inflated the tiniest psychological imbalance to inner drama. Eldorado, according to Herreman, was a breath of fresh air with verses full of violence and warmth, and on the whole expressed a deep desire to grasp life at its fullest. Poet and critic Nico Donkersloot noted that the glory days of Dutch lyric poetry seemed to have passed, and while praising Slauerhoff as the greatest poet of his generation said Eldorado was disappointing, possibly because of high expectations.\nHendrik Marsman, a fellow poet and critic, wrote a highly favorable review; in 1931, he wrote that of all contemporary poets Slauerhoff most closely exhibited the \"original life force of the formative beginning, of the poetic force\". He admired the apparent struggle between the formal, poetic power, whose desire is to express itself using the highest human faculty (language), a poetic power that is at the same time \"thwarted,"

Onitsha is a novel by French Nobel laureate writer J. M. G. Le Cl\u00e9zio. It was originally published in French in 1991 and an English translation was released in 1997.\nThe book is a critique on racism and the vestiges of colonialism as seen from the youthful perspective of the main character\nThroughout the book, Fintan's rejection of colonialism is symbolized by the attacks of his mother Maou, who increasingly speaks out against the way the colonials treat the indigenous people. The book seemingly mimics Le Cl\u00e9zio's own life, especially when the character travels back to Africa in an attempt to fill in the sense of loss he had suffered, to renew it in his mind, a task that ends in a dead end.\nAlison Anderson is the author of Darwin's Wink and the translator of seventeen books, including The Elegance of the Hedgehog, by Muriel Barbery.  Anderson wrote about how it was for her to have translated Onitsha for the fall 1997 edition of World Literature Today\nOnitsha was, as I may have already implied by now, a translator's dream. The language is fluid and evocative, not too difficult, clear and classical. This may seem obvious to readers of the original, but if I just cite some other examples of literature I have translated or looked at, I realize just how fortunate I have been to translate Le Clezio. I have done excerpts from Sylvie Germain's work, and it is extremely difficult \u2013 challenging, no doubt, but often near-impossible, leading to a kind of rapturous frustration for the translator, because the language is so baroque and rich, so very idiomatically French as well, that if one is not careful it quickly becomes unpalatable to the English reader. Either the poetry is lost, or one must betray the original: I found myself walking a real tightrope in working with her text.\nAlison Anderson published her own  synopsis of Onitsha\n\"Onitsha\" is remarkable for its \"almost mythological evocation of local history and beliefs.\" It is full of atmosphere \u2013 sights, sounds, smells \u2013 and at times the author's sentences seem to flow with the dreamy languor of the river itself. But J. M. G. Le Clezio \"never lets us forget the harsh realities of life nor the subsequent tragedy of war.\" A startling account \u2013 and indictment \u2013 of colonialism, \"Onitsha\" is also a work of clear, forthright prose that ably portrays both colonial Nigeria and a young boy's growing outrage\n\nLe Cl\u00e9zio, J.M.G.

The Moon and the Sun is a novel by American writer Vonda N. McIntyre, published in 1997. The book combines two major genres: science fiction (specifically the alternate history subgenre) and historical romance. It won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1997, beating out A Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin. The novel was inspired by the short story (written in the form of a faux-encyclopedia article) \"The Natural History and Extinction of the People of the Sea\", also by McIntyre, which was illustrated by fellow author Ursula K. Le Guin.\nMarie-Jos\u00e8phe de la Croix - Lady-in-waiting to King Louis XIV's niece and the younger sister of Father Yves de la Croix. She is an amateur composer and lover of mathematics who was Convent-raised and, at first, na\u00efve. As assistant to her brother in his scientific endeavors (mainly as a sketcher of specimens), she also shares her brother's interests in natural philosophy. She befriends the sea monster, later called Sherzad, and being the only one able to understand the sea monster, becomes her translator.\nFather Yves de la Croix  - Marie-Jos\u00e8phe's older brother. A Jesuit priest and King Louis's natural philosopher, he recently returned from an expedition commissioned by the King to find the legendary sea monster \u2013 the possible key to immortality.

The epitome of etiquette, he is Marie-Jos\u00e8phe's love interest. He is stuck between his kindling feelings for Marie-Jos\u00e8phe and his duty to his beloved King.\nSherzad (the sea creature/sea woman) - One of the last sea monsters in the world, she is captured by Father Yves de la Croix and caged in the Apollo fountain in the Versailles for King Louis XIV. Her flesh is rumored to make the eater immortal. Her saliva is able to heal wounds, though this fact is not realized by the other characters. She has two tails, tangled hair, and a gargoyle face, as well as an enchanting voice, the music of which is her way of communicating. However, she can only communicate with Marie-Jos\u00e8phe.

London brought the project to Jim Henson Pictures, who said he was drawn to \"the weird juxtaposition (of) a completely imagined creature in this very specific historical world.\" The film was set to be directed by Christopher Renshaw, which would've been his feature film debut, and written by Laura Harrington with McIntyre's involvement. Stephanie Allain and Kristine Belson would executive producer from Jim Henson Pictures. Film producer Bill Mechanic later joined production and brought the film to Walt Disney Pictures after signing a five-year deal with the company in December 2001. Mechanic planned for the film to start pre-production in early 2002, with Natalie Portman to star and James Schamus to revise the script, with Gregory Hoblit to possibly direct. Following Sony breaking from the joint venture of Jim Henson Pictures in 1999, the film would be produced by The Jim Henson Company instead.\nIn August 2013, it was announced that Sean McNamara would direct the film, and that casting included Pierce Brosnan as King Louis XIV, Fan Bingbing as the mermaid, and Bill Nighy as Pere de Chaise, a character created for the movie. Nighy pulled out of the film due to a scheduling conflict and was replaced by William Hurt weeks before filming. The film began production on April 23, 2014, at Victoria, Australia, along with Docklands Studios Melbourne. Additional filming also took place in Versailles, France. Mechanic had also revised the script with Barry Berman and Ronald Bass. Chinese film company Kylin Films invested $20.5 million into the movie, making it China's biggest financial contribution to a non-studio film produced outside China.\nParamount Pictures acquired US distribution rights and set the movie for wide release on April 10, 2015, with international sales being handled by Good Universe. However, three weeks before the film's release, the film was pulled from its schedule. A source close to the film claimed that the film needed more time to complete the special effects work.\n\"The Natural History & Extinction of the People of the Sea\". BookView Cafe.

The basic premise is that the two books written by Lewis Carroll are a distortion of the 'true story'. It features twists and turns on the original story, such as the white rabbit really being Alyss's (Alice's) tutor, Bibwit Harte, and the Mad Hatter is really a very agile, somber bodyguard called Hatter Madigan. The Looking Glass Wars is the first book in a trilogy by the same name. It was first released in the United Kingdom in 2004, and released in the United States in 2006. ...",

In interviews, Beddor claims he wrote the first book after seeing an incomplete deck of cards as part of a display of ancient playing cards at the British Museum. The images on these cards resembled Wonderland characters, while the cards themselves seemed to be illuminated by an unusual glow. He later went to a playing card collector who claimed to have the cards missing from the deck and told him the story of the Looking Glass Wars. The Looking Glass Wars is thus supposedly a faithful recording of this story.\nThe premise of the book is that Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice in Wonderland was fiction, but that the character Alice is real, as, indeed, is the world of Wonderland. Carroll's novel is said to have been inspired by the images, ideas, and names related by Alice to the author, whom she had requested to make a book of her personal history. The theme of the 2004 book The Looking Glass Wars is loss of innocence.\nThe book's prologue tells of Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson showing Alice Liddell (who claims her name to be spelled \"Alyss\") his manuscript for Alice's Adventures Under Ground. Alyss is shocked by the book's contents and refuses to speak to Dodgson ever again.\nThe story then begins many years earlier, on Alyss' seventh birthday in the Wonderland of Alyss' memory, which is ruled by imagination and is the source of all imagination for all other worlds. Wonderland features a class system similar to that seen in England during the 17th century, though on a far more minimalist scale. The government is a Queendom with an advising Parliament dominated by a playing card based hierarchy, with the Heart family at the top of the proverbial stack (i.e. the Wonderland Queen is a member of the Heart family, and the parliament is composed of reigning members of the Spades, Clubs, and Diamonds). Females are the dominant sex in Wonderland, as the ruling families are matriarchies.\nWonderland, ruled by Queen Genevieve Heart, is still recovering from a bloody civil war between \"White\" and \"Black\" Imagination which ended twelve years prior to the beginning of the story. Enough time has passed for those in the middle echelons of government to forget the day-to-day horrors of war and focus once more on the petty intrigues of a land at peace. Alyss' companions in her final hours in Wonderland include tutor Bibwit Harte (whose name is noted by Dodgson as being an anagram of \"White Rabbit\"), the Queen's bodyguard Hatter Madigan, Alyss' best friend Dodge Anders, childhood troublemaker Jack of Diamonds, and military commander General Doppelganger. \nDuring a bloody coup d'\u00e9tat led by Alyss' murderous Aunt Redd, the enemy of White Imagination, Alyss is forced to flee Wonderland in the company of Hatter Madigan, with Redd's top feline assassin (called only \"The Cat\") in pursuit. Queen Genevieve and Redd clash against one another in a final battle as Alyss barely manages to escape from the palace; Genevieve is killed by Redd. During this bloody battle, Dodge's father, Sir Justice Anders, is murdered by The Cat.\nThe two fugitives, Hatter and Alyss, enter an inter-dimensional gateway called the Pool of Tears, from which they emerge into Earth through an exit portal: a puddle. Alyss is separated from Hatter during the journey and she arrives in London, England, and Hatter in Paris, France. Lost and alone, Alyss spends some time with street orphans, then finds herself adopted by the Liddell family, whereby she is given the name \"Odd Alice\" for her tales about Wonderland and the way she insists her name be spelled. When Dodgson plagiarizes her stories for his own imagination rather than write them verbatim, she shuns her imagination and resolves to believe Wonderland false and lost to her forever.\nMeanwhile, Hatter is searching every corner of the world to find the lost princess. Believing that men dealing in headwear are men to be trusted above all others, he stops in every hat shop he can, inquiring the whereabouts of Princess Alyss Heart. Along his search he also trails people alight with the glow of White Imagination, knowing that Alyss would most likely glow the brightest. In the process, he becomes a mystery to people on Earth, who catch glimpses of him and create legends of a blade-wielding man on a strange quest leading him to headwear merchants around the world. After thirteen years of searching for the lost princess, Hatter finds Dodgson's book; he uses this to track down the author, and in turn, find Alyss, who is now twenty years of age. Upon arrival in Oxford, Hatter discovers that the princess is to marry to Prince Leopold. Before"

During the early 1960s, the formerly renowned British military intelligence organisation known colloquially as \"The Department\" is floundering. Surviving on long past memories of its aerial reconnaissance missions during the Second World War the organisation has been reduced to a skeleton crew consisting of Leclerc, a nostalgic former air commander who now languishes in bureaucracy as Director, John Avery, his 32 year old aide who took the job after failing as a publisher, Taylor, an elderly man who views the job as his last chance at glory, and Haldane, a pompous intellectual in ailing health whose research on the Soviet Union and East Germany has been the sole reason for departmental funding from Whitehall. Languishing in the mundanity of bureaucratic battles and inconsequential desk work, the organisation desperately desire the opportunity to regain their standing in the intelligence community, as well as to gain a one up against their now superior rivals in the Circus, headed by chief \"Control\" and his second-in-command, George Smiley. \nRather abruptly, The Department gets its wish when a defector passes information to the organisation regarding a build up Soviet missiles in Rostock along the West German border. They quickly manufacture a plan to act, and bribe a commercial pilot to accidentally stray off course and photograph the site in the hopes of verification. Taylor is then dispatched to Finland to rendezvous with the pilot. After collecting the film, Taylor is killed in a hit-and-run incident, which Leclerc interprets as an attempt to recapture the film by the Stasi. Further setbacks occur when Avery is dispatched to recover Taylor and his effects from the Finns when his documentation doesn't match Finnish information.\nDespite the setbacks and their lack of any recent field action, Leclerc persuades the Minister to allow them to send an agent over the wall into East Germany. Fearing the Circus will take the operation over, The Department are deliberately vague, and present the entire operation as a training exercise in order to obtain  old radio transmitters from Smiley. The Department then tracks down one of its old agents, a middle-aged naturalised Pole called Fred Leiser. Now a mechanic, Leiser has been out of the game a long time and knows little about the current circumstances of the intelligence community. Hoping to stave off any apprehension from Leiser, Haldane and Avery lie to him and tell him The Department is still the dominant espionage unit and is operating at the size it was at its wartime peak. Avery and Leiser become fast friends, with each feeling that the other is mutually beneficial. Avery believes that if Leiser's operation is successful, he will finally have accomplished something in his life that he can be proud of, whilst Leiser, currently in the midst of a mid-life crisis feels the operation is his chance to feel useful again and relive his wartime glory.\nIn order to train Leiser, The Department obtain a house in Oxford. Leiser is restricted to a precise daily training routine, and is allowed specific recreational activities on the condition he is accompanied one of the handlers on the training crew. Over the course of their time in Oxford, it becomes increasingly apparent that Leiser has lost his touch. He is repeatedly beaten with ease during his combat training sparring, whilst Avery helps him to cheat during their morse code training. Towards the end of his training period, however, Leiser begins to improve, and is able to pass all of his field readiness evaluations, including sending morse code messages whilst changing frequencies every two minutes to avoid detection which he had previously struggled with.\nUnder the cover of academics, The Department set up in a house close to the border. Leiser is taken on a driving tour where he is shown his entry point into East Germany, and then returned to the house to eat a final meal before crossing. It is at this point Leiser is informed he cannot take a firearm across the border with him, causing him to panic. During the inner-German border crossing, Leiser again panics and kills a young East German guard, which is published in East German media and causes national outrage. Now panicking, Leiser steals a motorcycle and meets a young German girl in a nearby town. In exchange for aid, Leiser agrees to give her sexual companionship, and, she hopes, a way back to the West.\nDuring his first transmission, Leiser again falls under the strain of the operation and forgets to change frequency regularly whilst"

Merlin Athrawes is confronted by Aivah Pahrshan, who reveals to him her suspicions that he and Ahbraim Zhevons are one and the same and that she had been tracking his activities for several years now. She reveals that she is the leader of the \"Sisterhood of Saint Kohdy,\" an ancient secret society founded after the death of Seijin Kohdy (who was previously believed to be mythical) under suspicious circumstances; the Church subsequently deleted his existence from its official record and annihilated the original Abbey of Saint Kohdy in a Rakurai strike. Aivah also reveals that Kohdy's tomb, journal and sword (\"Helm Cleaver\") were all relocated before the destruction of the Abbey and that large portions of the journal are in Spanish, a language the Sisterhood cannot understand. Despite the grave risks involved, the Inner Circle decides to bring Aivah and her personal maid Sandaria to Nimue's Cave and expose them to the complete truth, a truth that shocks them to their very core; neither suspected (despite the Sisterhood's essential doubts about some of the \"archangels\" and the Church) that the Holy Writ itself was based on falsehoods. Eventually, both accept the truth.\nThe Spanish portions of Saint Kohdy's journal are translated and the Inner Circle discovers previously unknown details about the War Against the Fallen. Saint Kohdy was in fact Sergeant Major Cody Cortazar, late of the Terran Federation Marine Corps. He had been drafted due to his combat skills and training by the surviving command crew to combat the \"Fallen Angels\" and their \"mortal\" supporters while winning the support of the ignorant population. To accomplish this, the command crew had sought to selectively reactivate his suppressed memories and in doing so had allowed him to remember his native tongue and fragments of his previous life on Earth. His experiences against someone the church had ruled a \"demon\" had shaken him to the point of questioning the \"archangels\" and he sought to meet with Schueler himself for reassurance (a meeting from which he did not return alive). Ultimately, the Inner Circle and Sisterhood agree to work together, and Merlin travels to Zion in disguise to make contact with the Sisterhoods' agents there.\nIn northern Siddarmark, Baron Green Valley takes troops specialized in winter combat and seizes key positions to the north of Bishop Militant Bahrnabai Wyrshym's positions in the Sylmahn Gap. Despite the wisdom of pulling Wyrshym and his troops back, the Grand Inquisitor refuses to yield any ground. Having blocked the Church's forces from the north, the allies subsequently attack Wyrshym's positions from the south in the Gap. With Harchong's relief force still five-days away from being able to relieve him and after sustaining heavy losses, Wyrshym is forced to surrender. Green Valley then orders the liberation of as many of the Church's concentration camps while Merlin, whose assassination of specific inquisitors and overzealous church guardsman cause the Inquisition to tone down its atrocities, rescues a family of \"suspected heretics\" and brings them to the Cave. They're given a new chance to rebuild their lives elsewhere.\nIn the south, the Dohlaran Army is forced to retreat while Bishop Militant Cahnyr Kaitswyrth's forces are surrounded and defeated by the Allies (Kaitswyrth subsequently commits suicide). In the aftermath of such massive reversals, Vicar Zhaspahr Clyntahn attempts to have Maigwair removed from his position through political maneuvering. However, the secret meeting of his loyalists at a secluded church in Zion is bombed by the Sisterhoods' agents (named the \"Fist of God\") with Merlin's help. The attack, coupled with Maigwair's swift action to secure his position and the propaganda broadsheets claiming responsibility for this attack (as well as for the assassination of other vicars), seriously undermines Clyntahn's position and the Inquisition's aura of invincibility. However, the evidence leads Wyllym Rayno, Chyntahn's second in command in the Inquisition, to conclude that the Fist of God is indeed, in league with \"demons.\"\nIn Dohlar, Ahlverez finds himself fighting for his political career after his defeat in Siddarmark. Meanwhile, Dohlar's new \"screw galleys\" are pitted against a Charisian squadron of galleons and one ironclad with both sides sustaining heavy losses. The battle ends with a Dohlaran victory and the capture of the iron clad and over 500 Charisian seamen, though some Charisian ships escape. Despite attempts by the Dohlaran leadership to convince the Church otherwise, Clyntahn demands the extradition of all the"

Many of the individual stories collected in The Magic Barrel depict the search for hope and meaning within the bleak enclosures of poor urban settings. The title story focuses on the unlikely relationship of Leo Finkle, an unmarried rabbinical student, and Pinye Salzman, a colorful marriage broker. Finkle has spent most of life with his nose buried in books and therefore isn't well-educated in life itself. However, Finkle has a greater interest \u2013 the art of romance. He engages the services of Salzman, who shows Finkle a number of potential brides from his \"magic barrel\" but with each picture Finkle grows more uninterested. After Salzman convinces him to meet Lily Hirschorn, Finkle realizes his life is truly empty and lacking the passion to love God or humanity. When Finkle discovers a picture of Salzman's daughter and sees her suffering, he sets out on a new mission to save her. Other well-known stories included in the collection are: \"The Last Mohican\", \"Angel Levine\", \"The First Seven Years\", and \"The Mourners\". This last story focuses on Kessler, the defiant old man in need of \"social security\" and Gruber, the belligerent landlord who doesn't want Kessler in the tenement anymore.\nThe 13 stories included in The Magic Barrel appear in the following sequence:\n\"The First Seven Years\"\n\"The Mourners\"\n\"The Girl of My Dreams\"\n\"Angel Levine\"\n\"Behold the Key\"\n\"Take Pity\"\n\"The Prison\"\n\"The Lady of the Lake\"\n\"A Summer's Reading\"\n\"The Bill\"\n\"The Last Mohican\"\n\"The Loan\"\n\"The Magic Barrel\"\nThis section provides a brief capsule, or synopsis, view of each story, including publication information and links to relevant articles. Also see: Bernard Malamud bibliography for additional details:\n\"The First Seven Years\"\u2013 first published in the Partisan Review (September\u2013October 1950 issue)\n\"The Mourners \u2013 first appeared in Discovery in January, 1955\n\"The Girl of My Dreams\" \u2013 originally appeared in American Mercury, January 1953\n\"The Angel Levine\" \u2013 adapted for the screen, The Angel Levine is a 1970 film starring Harry Belafonte and Zero Mostel and directed by J\u00e1n Kad\u00e1r.\n\"Behold the Key\" \u2013 this is one of five \"Italian\" stories (i.e., set in Italy) Malamud wrote, excluding the 6 stories that appeared in Pictures of Fidelman.\n\"Take Pity\"\n\"The Prison\" \u2013 first appeared in Commentary (September 1950 issue).\n\"The Lady of the Lake\"\n\"A Summer's Reading\"\n\"The Bill\"\n\"The Last Mohican\"\n\"The Loan\"\n\"The Magic Barrel\"\nSynopsis \u2013 The title story starts as the about-to-be rabbi Leo Finkle has been urged by his teachers to find a wife before he actually becomes a rabbi; he gets a bigger congregation that way, they say. Because he is quite incapable (he recognizes this later on in the story and presumes his study stole his social life) and has almost finished his study (and thus has to hurry), he answers an ad of a marriage counselor. Unhappy and terribly sorry about a meeting with one of the proposed women, he retreats back again to his study. The marriage counselor suddenly turns up delivering him photographs of women, which he initially ignores. However, something draws him to them and after viewing several of them he discovers another one in the envelope. He instantly falls in love with that picture and yearns to meet her. After he's found the marriage counselor (who left him immediately after delivering the photographs) the girl turns out to be the counselor's daughter (though at first the counselor states it's one of the photographs that should have been in the barrel; hence Finkle thinks of the barrel as magic). He gets to meet her anyway; the marriage counselor (her father) hiding around the corner, \"chanting prayers for the dead.\"\nMarc Blitzstein adapted the story as a libretto for a one-act opera, the music for which he began but completed only a scene and a song.  Said song was premiered at the 1964 Marc Blitzstein Memorial Concert conducted by Leonard Bernstein and recorded on Koch by William Sharp. A performance of it by Erin Passmore, introduced and accompanied by Leonard Lehrman at the 2012 Halifax Summer Opera Workshop, was videotaped and posted on YouTube.\nModern first editions - a set on Flickr\n\"National Book Awards \u2013 1959\".

Gene Forrester returns to his old prep school, Devon (a thinly veiled portrayal of Knowles's alma mater, Phillips Exeter Academy), fifteen years after he graduated, to visit two places he regards as \"fearful sites:\" a flight of marble stairs and a big tree by the river. First of all, he examines the stairs and notices that they are made of marble. Then, he goes to the tree, which brings back memories of his time as a student at Devon. From then on, the novel follows Gene's description from the summer of 1942 to the summer of 1943. In 1942, he is 16 and living at Devon with his best friend and roommate, Phineas (nicknamed Finny). World War II is taking place and has a prominent effect on the story's plot and characters.\nGene and Finny, despite being opposites in personality, are surprisingly close friends. Gene's quiet, introverted, intellectual personality is a character foil for Finny's extroverted, carefree athleticism. One of Finny's ideas during their \"gypsy summer\" of 1942 is to create a \"Super Suicide Society of the Summer Session,\" with Gene and himself as charter members. Finny creates a rite of initiation by having members jump into the Devon River from a large tall tree.\nGene and Finny's friendship goes through a period of one-sided rivalry during which Gene strives to outdo Finny academically since he believes Finny is trying to outdo him athletically. The rivalry begins with Gene's jealousy towards Finny. It climaxes and ends when as Finny and Gene are about to jump off the tree, Gene impulsively jounces the branch they are standing on, which causes Finny to fall and shatter his leg, which permanently cripples him. Because of his accident, Finny learns that he will never again be able to compete in sports, which are most dear to him.\nFinny's \"accident\" inspires Gene to think more like his friend to become a better person, free of envy. The remainder of the story revolves around Gene's attempts to come to grips with who he is, why he shook the branch, and how he will proceed. Gene feels so guilty that he eventually tells Finny that he caused the fall. At first, Finny does not believe him, but then comes to feel extremely hurt.\nWorld War II soon occupies the schoolboys' time, with the student Brinker Hadley rallying the boys to help the war effort and Gene's quiet friend Leper Lepellier joining the Ski Troops and becoming severely traumatized by what he sees.\nDuring a meeting of the Golden Fleece Debating Society, Brinker sets up a show trial of sorts and, based upon his shaking of the branch, accuses Gene of trying to kill Finny. Faced with the evidence, Finny leaves shamefully before Gene's deed is confirmed. On his way out, Finny falls down a flight of stairs, the same ones that Gene visits at the beginning of the novel, and again breaks the leg that he had shattered before. Finny at first dismisses Gene's attempts to apologize, but he soon realizes that the \"accident\" was impulsive and not premeditated or based on anger. The two forgive each other.\nThe next day, Finny dies during the operation to set the bone when bone marrow enters his bloodstream during the surgery.\nAfter they graduate, Gene and Brinker enlist in the Navy and the Coast Guard.

                "description": "To the Lighthouse is a 1927 novel by Virginia Woolf. The novel centres on the Ramsay family and their visits to the Isle of Skye in Scotland between 1910 and 1920. Following and extending the tradition of modernist novelists like Marcel Proust and James Joyce, the plot of To the Lighthouse is secondary to its philosophical introspection. Cited as a key example of the literary technique of multiple focalization, the novel includes little dialogue and almost no direct action; most of it is written as thoughts and observations. The novel recalls childhood emotions and highlights adult relationships. Among the book's many tropes and themes are those of loss, subjectivity, the nature of art and the problem of perception. ...",

The section begins with Mrs Ramsay assuring her son James that they should be able to visit the lighthouse on the next day. This prediction is denied by Mr Ramsay, who voices his certainty that the weather will not be clear. This opinion forces a certain tension between Mr and Mrs Ramsay, and also between Mr Ramsay and James. This particular incident is referred to on various occasions throughout the section, especially in the context of Mr and Mrs Ramsay's relationship.\nThe Ramsays and their eight children are joined at the house by a number of friends and colleagues. One of these friends, Lily Briscoe, begins the novel as a young, uncertain painter attempting a portrait of Mrs. Ramsay and James. Briscoe finds herself plagued by doubts throughout the novel, doubts largely fed by the claims of Charles Tansley, another guest, who asserts that women can neither paint nor write. Tansley himself is an admirer of Mr Ramsay, a philosophy professor, and Ramsay's academic treatises.\nThe section closes with a large dinner party. When Augustus Carmichael, a visiting poet, asks for a second serving of soup, Mr Ramsay nearly snaps at him. Mrs Ramsay is herself out of sorts when Paul Rayley and Minta Doyle, two acquaintances whom she has brought together in engagement, arrive late to dinner, as Minta has lost her grandmother's brooch on the beach.\nThe second section, \"Time passes\", gives a sense of time passing, absence, and death. Ten years pass, during which the First World War begins and ends. Mrs Ramsay dies, as do two of her children \u2013 Prue dies from complications of childbirth, and Andrew is killed in the war. Mr Ramsay is left adrift without his wife to praise and comfort him during his bouts of fear and anguish regarding the longevity of his philosophical work. This section is told from an omniscient point of view and occasionally from Mrs. McNab's point of view. Mrs. McNab worked in the Ramsay's house since the beginning, and thus provides a clear view of how things have changed in the time the summer house has been unoccupied.\nIn the final section, \"The Lighthouse\", some of the remaining Ramsays and other guests return to their summer home ten years after the events of Part I. Mr Ramsay finally plans on taking the long-delayed trip to the lighthouse with daughter Cam(illa) and son James (the remaining Ramsay children are virtually unmentioned in the final section). The trip almost does not happen, as the children are not ready, but they eventually set off. As they travel, the children are silent in protest at their father for forcing them to come along. However, James keeps the sailing boat steady and rather than receiving the harsh words he has come to expect from his father, he hears praise, providing a rare moment of empathy between father and son; Cam's attitude towards her father changes also, from resentment to eventual admiration.\nThey are accompanied by the sailor Macalister and his son, who catches fish during the trip. The son cuts a piece of flesh from a fish he has caught to use for bait, throwing the injured fish back into the sea.\nWhile they set sail for the lighthouse, Lily attempts to finally complete the painting she has held in her mind since the start of the novel. She reconsiders her memory of Mrs and Mr Ramsay, balancing the multitude of impressions from ten years ago in an effort to reach towards an objective truth about Mrs Ramsay and life itself. Upon finishing the painting (just as the sailing party reaches the lighthouse) and seeing that it satisfies her, she realises that the execution of her vision is more important to her than the idea of leaving some sort of legacy in her work.\n\nLarge parts of Woolf's novel do not concern themselves with the objects of vision, but rather investigate the means of perception, attempting to understand people in the act of looking. To be able to understand thought, Woolf's diaries reveal, the author would spend considerable time listening to herself think, observing how and which words and emotions arose in her own mind in response to what she saw.\nThis examination of perception is not, however, limited to isolated inner-dialogues, but also analysed in the context of human relationships and the tumultuous emotional spaces crossed to truly reach another human being. Two sections of the book stand out as excellent snapshots of fumbling attempts at this crossing: the silent interchange between Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay as they pass the time alone together at the end of section 1, and Lily Briscoe's struggle to fulfill Mr. Ramsay's desire for sympathy (and"

Unlike a lot of Wolfe's work Peace is a standalone novel set in a somewhat contemporary time and place (as opposed to the future or an imaginary world). Despite this, the story of the novel is one of Wolfe's strangest and most difficult; the narrator's consciousness at times seems to transcend time and space, as if he's narrating from beyond our plane of reality. One interpretation is that the narrator, Weer, is dead, and the scattered memories are those of a ghost; in 2014, Wolfe confirmed that this was his intention.\nDifferent critics interpret differently what is actually happening in the novel, and another interpretation is that the memories of his old age are the fantasies of a middle-aged Weer, who is experiencing a nervous breakdown. The novel includes subtle clues to guide the reader's understanding of the story, although the mysteries behind these clues have been hotly debated.\nAs in many of Wolfe's novels, much of Peace is taken up with stories within stories, particularly stories told to Weer as a child. Many of the key events of the novel are not explicitly narrated, but can be inferred or guessed at based on information in the stories-within-stories.\nWolfe has described Peace as his favorite of his own work, as it is the one where he came closest to achieving his original goals. Neil Gaiman, who has frequently praised the novel, said: \"Peace really was a gentle Midwestern memoir the first time I read it. It only became a horror novel on the second or the third reading.\"\nJoan Gordon (1986). Gene Wolfe. Wildside Press. ISBN\u00a0978-0-89370-956-3.

The Reverberator is a short novel by Henry James, first published  as a serial in Macmillan's Magazine in 1888, and then as a book later the same year. Described by the leading web authority on Henry James as \"a delightful Parisian bonbon,\" the comedy traces the complications that result when nasty but true stories about a Paris family get into the American scandal sheet of the novel's title.\nJames had no love for publicity himself, so he doesn't spare Francie's gaucherie in blabbing about the Proberts' dirty laundry. On the other hand, he doesn't mind drubbing the stick-necked snobbery of many members of the Probert family. In the last analysis, James clearly sides with his heroine and grants her a happy ending.\nFlack, the archetypical newspaperman who can't wait to splatter the latest gossip in newsprint, comes in for a predictable trashing by James. \"For the convenience of society\" in identifying Flack, says James, \"he ought always to have worn something conspicuous - a green hat or a yellow necktie.\" Francie has divided critics somewhat. She's honest and appealing but also naive to a fault. Gaston wavers and hesitates like many a Jamesian male, but he eventually does the right thing.\nEven the ever-critical William James liked his younger brother's work in this \"Parisian bonbon.\" Almost everybody concedes the novel's charm, but some have demurred at the slightness of the material. Of course, after the critical failure of The Bostonians and The Princess Casamassima, James might have been gun-shy about weightier topics.\nIn the New York Edition preface, James calls the novel a jeu d\u2019esprit and \"so slight a composition.\" But he then launches into a long, dense discussion of the structure, origins and characters of the book.\nIn 1952, the British writer Dodie Smith adapted the novel into a play Letter from Paris, which ran for 27 performances at London's Aldwych Theatre.\nThe Novels of Henry James by Edward Wagenknecht (New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., 1983) ISBN\u00a00-8044-2959-6\nThe Novels of Henry James by Oscar Cargill (New York: Macmillan Co., 1961)\nWorks related to The Reverberator at Wikisource\n Media related to The Reverberator at Wikimedia Commons\nThe New York Edition text of The Reverberator (1908)\nAuthor's preface to the New York Edition text of The Reverberator (1908)\nNote on the various texts of The Reverberator at\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Reverberator public domain audiobook at LibriVox\nLibrary of America web site"

William de Worde is the black sheep of an influential Ankh-Morpork family, scraping out a humble lifestyle as a common scribe and making extra pocket money by producing a gossipy newsletter for foreign notables. This arrangement is soon undermined by the arrival of a team of dwarves to Ankh-Morpork who intend to start a printing business; however, de Worde and the dwarves establish The Ankh-Morpork Times  later employing Sacharissa Cripslock and Otto, a black-ribbon vampire and iconographer. However, Guild of Engravers is antagonised by the unauthorised efforts of the Times; in response, the Guild cuts off their paper supplies and establish the rival newspaper The Ankh-Morpork Inquirer, a loss-making tabloid filled with popular fabricated stories.\nMeanwhile, a conspiracy is afoot in the city to depose the Patrician, Lord Vetinari. The wealthy and powerful (but anonymous) Committee to Unelect the Patrician hire Mr. Pin and Mr. Tulip, a pair of villainous mercenaries from outside Ankh-Morpork known as the New Firm, to frame Vetinari with a staged embezzlement and replace him with a puppet, the President of the Guild of Shoemakers and Leatherworkers, Tuttle Scrope. Pin and Tulip manage to catch off-guard the normally impassible Patrician with Charlie, a witless Vetinari look-alike that they had previously kidnapped in Pseudopolis and forced to collaborate. The plan starts going south, though, when Drumknott, Vetinari's clerk returns in the middle of the scene and the New Firm is forced to stab him and render Vetinari unconscious, hoping to also frame him for murder; their efforts are hampered by Lord Vetinari's prized terrier, Wuffles, who bites Mr. Pin and escapes, becoming the sole witness to the crime.\nWilliam makes the mistake of advertising a reward for information leading to Wuffles' recovery, causing a frenzy among the local Ankh Morpork population. Disguised as Omnian clergy, the New Firm attempt to gather information about Wuffles from the Times. Realising that the job is much harder than their employers had initially suggested, the New Firm decides to skip town. Although the job is unfinished they extort from their employers' zombie lawyer and representative Mr. Slant their promised payment and a big \"bonus\" in jewels, using compromising previous voice recordings captured with a dis-organiser Mk II.\nAn anonymous tipster named \"Deep Bone\", helps William track down Wuffles and \"translate\" his testimony, giving William the last pieces of the puzzle. In the meantime, Sacharissa accidentally discovers the New Firm\u2019s hideout in William's own family manor and is captured by the pair of thugs. They head back to the Times hoping to exchange her for Wuffles and then, silence all witnesses. In the ensuing struggle a lamp explodes and the Times offices catch fire. William and the others manage to escape outside while Pin and Tulip hide in the cellar. Pin, now only partially sane after having a dark-light 'obscurograph' taken of him, emerges from the cellars, having killed Tulip to steal his potato (which he believed would protect him) and to use him as a raft against molten lead, and attacks William once the fire is out, only to be killed when he is impaled on the memo spike from William's desk. William retrieves the fortune in jewels, the dis-organiser, and the last bit of evidence. However, with the press and office destroyed, it seems like the Times will not be able to go live with their break-out reportage in time. The liberal application of a crossbow wielded by a daring Saccharisa, dwarven axes, bribery in jewels, and Otto's sense of dramatic atmosphere helps the crew borrow one of the Inquirer's presses for the evening. After discovering that 'Cut Me Own Throat' Dibbler was hired by the Inquirer as its editor, William and Sacharissa hire him to sell advertising space in the Times.\nThe big story breaks the next day and Lord Vetinari's name is cleared just before a new, Guild-controlled Patrician would have seized power. The recordings on the dis-organizer help William to discover the identity of the man behind the Committee, his father Lord de Worde.  He decides to confront him. A tense argument, blackmail with the threat of exposure, a fortune in jewels, and threats from Otto fail to intimidate Lord de Worde into leaving the city in exile as William demands. However, after learning that his machinations nearly killed his own son, he admits defeat and walks away.\nWilliam is ambivalent about the new and unexpected role of the free press in his life and in the world but resolves that someone must tell"

The book opens with a retelling of the aftermath of November 2, 2004, as all the major news stations claim that incumbent U.S. President George W. Bush\u2014reelected with an historically narrow margin over his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, of less than 2.5 percentage points\u2014won an \"ideological mandate\" in this election. Franken points to the previous low point for incumbent presidents' reelections, Woodrow Wilson's 3.2-point 1916 victory, juxtaposes them with the landslide reelection victories of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, Richard Nixon in 1972, and Ronald Reagan in 1984, and counter-argues that Bush's margin of victory was nowhere close to these lopsided contests; further, Franken points out that Bush's margin was 6 points narrower than that of Bill Clinton in 1996 over Republican challenger Bob Dole, and that nobody considered that victory a \"mandate\".\nFranken then enumerates the reasons he believes Bush won, as summarized in three rhyming words:\nFear: He used the threat of terrorism to scare voters into believing John Kerry wouldn't be able to protect them;\nSmear: He misrepresented Kerry's record; and\nQueers: He turned gay marriage into a wedge issue.\nFranken uses several quotes from throughout the 2004 campaign to illustrate the point of \"How Bush Won: Fear\". In several instances campaigners heavily relied on the events of 9/11 to paint President Bush as a strong military leader and John Kerry as a waffler. Franken counters with direct quotes from the 9/11 Commission that suggest Bush ignored or overlooked several key pieces of intelligence from the CIA that, if acted upon, could have prevented the attacks altogether.\nFranken also writes that Bill Clinton received similar intelligence regarding potential attacks on January 1, 2000, and was able to quickly raise the security level and prevent terrorist activity.\nHe also talks about terror management theory and its relevance to the 2004 campaign, including numerous \"conflations\" by Republicans, particularly at their national convention, of the Iraq War with the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Almost no mention is made at the 2004 Republican National Convention of Osama bin Laden, whose terrorist group al Qaeda is considered to have perpetrated the events of 9/11; across all the speeches delivered during television prime time, there was only one mention, by then-Governor of New York George Pataki. Meanwhile, the words \"terror\"/\"terrorism\"/\"terrorist\", and mentions of Iraq, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, and 9/11 occurred 178 times in total.\nOne chapter is devoted to exploring the idea that 9/11 was used, as the wife of blogger Dwight Meredith phrased it, as Bush's \"little black dress\"\u2014something he could slip on for any occasion, something he could use to justify any action he took.\nIn \"How Bush Won: Smear,\" Franken addresses the accusations of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth group that alleged during the 2004 election that John Kerry's medals for valor were actually based on an act of cowardice. The incident, involving Kerry's killing of a Viet Cong soldier, was not witnessed by any of the group's members. Moreover, the group dubiously claimed that Kerry shot a potentially unarmed and wounded teenager in the back while he attempted to escape.\nFranken surmises, using the testimony of the soldiers who were actually there, that Kerry's original version is the correct version. Franken also quotes a Ted Koppel story from 2004 when Koppel went to Vietnam and spoke personally with the commander of the Vietcong attack, who verified the man killed by Kerry was an adult, and military records that show the man was in possession of a grenade launcher.\nThe chapter ends with Franken delving into Karl Rove's record of smears. John McCain is mentioned briefly, as the victim of a claim by Rove (during Bush's 2000 search for the Republican presidential nomination) that McCain's adopted Bangladeshi daughter Bridget was actually an illegitimate African-American daughter, a claim which was spread via in infamous push poll. The chapter also contains a detailed account of Alabama Supreme Court justice Mark Kennedy, whose record of advocacy for children was twisted into an accusation of pedophilia.\nAt this point, Franken writes that he has been hospitalized with \"Rove-induced septic shock.\" The chapter that follows, \"A Brief Recuperative Debunk,\" shifts away from the Bush campaign to debunk a litany of false"

Firedrake is a young dragon who lives in a hidden valley in Scotland with other dragons. After realizing that humans intend to flood the valley and the dragons living there are no longer safe, Firedrake sets off with the guidance from the eldest member of his clan (Slatebeard) to avoid the \"Golden One\" and to find the Rim of Heaven, a legendary location that is a safe haven for all dragons.\nFiredrake travels to the city with his friend Sorrel, a forest brownie, to find Gilbert Graytail, a rat who specializes in making maps. The duo meets Ben who provides Sorrel with human clothes so she may go in disguise to find Gilbert while Firedrake stays hidden. After finding Gilbert and providing payment, Gilbert hands over a map leading to the Himalayas, marking dangerous areas along the way. Only able to fly at night, Firedrake wastes no time wanting to leave. He and Sorrel also decide to bring Ben along with them. After Ben and Sorrel argue about turning East too soon or not, the three end up in a mountain range full of dwarves. Firedrake sleeps while the sun is up and the dwarves wait for him to wake up. While he rests however, one of the dwarves, Gravelbeard, runs to the castle in that same mountain range, revealing Nettlebrand, the Golden One, a fearsome dragon-like monster whose only purpose in life is to hunt, kill and eat dragons and his servant, Twigleg the Homunculus. After hearing of the trio, Nettlebrand decides to follow them, hoping to hunt down and kill the last of the dragons because he failed decades before.\nFiredrake, Sorrel and Ben fly onward, but are soon swept off course by a storm, arriving on the shore of Egypt. Encountering a basilisk and a band of zealous archaeologists, the party eventually befriends a kindly scientist named Professor Greenbloom. Sorrel is initially suspicious but soon warms up to him. Professor Greenbloom gives Ben one of two freezing-cold metallic scales he has, which unknown to the humans, once belonged to Nettlebrand. Twigleg relays the news to Nettlebrand, who immediately makes his way to the dig site to find Professor Greenbloom and recover the scales. Meanwhile, the three searchers set out on the advice of the professor to seek the advice of a Djinn, whose thousand eyes can see everything. Ben succeeds in fulfilling the Djinn's arcane requirements with the question: \"Where does the Rim of Heaven lie?\" The answer to the question appears in two of the Djinn's thousand eyes; it is a path, marked by the Indus River, by a mountain range, and by a monastery. Beyond this monastery is the Rim of Heaven. In the monastery, Ben must break the moonlight on the stone dragon's head. The Djinn also gives them a prophecy: \"When that day comes, twenty fingers will point the way to the Rim of Heaven, and silver will be worth more than gold.\"\nMeanwhile, Nettlebrand tracks down Greenbloom, who managed to escape him. Twigleg is discovered but is allowed to stay due to his almost-perfect ability to understand and translate any language. He has grown to be very attached to Ben, and he begins relaying false information to his master, sending him into the middle of a desert where he got attacked by the sandmans, who the monster eventually escapes from. While flying over the ocean, a lunar eclipse occurs and Firedrake (who lives off of moonlight), cannot fly. He falls and lands on the back of an initially frightening but amiable sea serpent. She agrees to take the friends to Pakistan, where they will rendezvous with a Dracologist, Zubeida Ghalib. She alone knows a way to help Firedrake fly without moonlight. Along the way, the Serpent tells them (among other things) about Nettlebrand and his army of red-eyed Ravens. As the peaceful voyage atop Serpent-back continues, they are spotted by one of Nettlebrand's raven spies. Annoyed, Sorrel throws a stone which she has smeared her adhesive saliva. The stone sticks to the Raven's wing and sends him panicking to shore. In Pakistan, the friends enter a village where Zubeida the Dracologist is living and also find Professor Greenbloom. His wife and daughter, Guinevere, have joined him on account of the incident with Nettlebrand. Deeply worried, the two parties compare their findings, which all point to a single grim fact\u2014Nettlebrand is hunting the Dragons who live in the Rim of Heaven, and expects Firedrake to find them for him.\nDr. Ghalib reveals a legend of a Dragon Rider who once lived in the village.

When she strides into the East Village bookstore where Joe Goldberg works, he is instantly smitten with her. Beck is everything Joe has ever wanted: gorgeous, tough, razor-smart, and as sexy as his wildest dreams.  Beck does not know it yet, but she is perfect for him, and soon she cannot resist her feelings for a guy who seems custom-made for her.

The conservative Carol is horrified by Tessa's alternative-styled roommate, upperclassman Steph Jones. When Carol fails to convince Tessa to switch dorms, Carol warns her daughter about the dangers of college parties before leaving with Noah. The next morning, Tessa returns to her room to find one of Steph's friends inside, an attractive, tattooed boy who makes several rude comments to Tessa. Steph tells Tessa about the boy, Hardin Scott, who is a rebellious figure on campus.\nOn the first day of college classes, Tessa befriends Landon Gibson, who is also an English major. Tessa learns from Landon that Hardin is his future step-brother since Landon's mom and Hardin's dad are engaged. After the first week of college, Tessa reluctantly accompanies Steph to the party and plays \u2018Truth or Dare\u2019 with Steph's friends, including Hardin, during which she admits she is a virgin. Hardin is dared to kiss Tessa, but she runs from the group, embarrassed. Hardin catches up to her and they share an intense moment which he takes as trivial. Carol disapproves of Tessa's activities and blames Steph, so Tessa promises to ignore her. But Hardin falls for Tessa.\nHardin brings Tessa to a stream in the woods, where he gives Tessa her first orgasm. When Tessa implies the two are now dating, Hardin says he doesn't date, leaving Tessa heartbroken. She subsequently ignores Hardin and invites Noah to stay the night with her. That night, Landon calls Tessa to help him control a drunken Hardin. After an argument with Hardin, they are intimate together again. The next morning, Tessa begs Noah for forgiveness for leaving him alone, and he says he'll think about it. Hardin breaks up with Tessa for refusing to reveal her infidelity to Noah, but they later resolve the conflict.\nTessa meets Ken Scott, Hardin\u2019s father and the chancellor of the college, and he invites her to dinner at his home. During the course of the evening, Hardin argues with Ken and storms out to the backyard, where Tessa consoles him. Tessa stays the night and witnesses Hardin's intense nightmares. The next morning, Hardin takes Tessa back to her room, only for Noah to be waiting for them. A fight almost breaks out between the two men, but Tessa tells Noah to leave after Hardin indirectly confesses his love for her. Landon warns Tessa to be careful with Hardin.\nKen uses his connections to get Tessa an internship at a  publishing company, asking in exchange for Tessa to convince Hardin to come to his wedding with Karen. Hardin, initially pleased with the news of Tessa\u2019s internship, becomes cold when he meets with his friends and abandons Tessa. Tessa later finds Hardin with Molly on his lap. Fuming, Tessa plays Truth or Dare with the group and kisses Zed to upset Hardin. Hardin, in turn, dares Molly to kiss him. When Tessa tries to run away, Hardin chases her and declares his love in front of everyone. Tessa rejects him and leaves. Hardin sullenly takes back his declaration, so Tessa goes on a date with Zed. They attend a party, and after Tessa returns to Zed\u2019s apartment, they kiss. However, this makes Tessa realize how strong her feelings are for Hardin. She returns to Hardin, and they confess their love for each other. Hardin finally agrees to attend his father\u2019s wedding.\nThey return to Tessa\u2019s dorm and find a furious Carol waiting for them. Carol demands Tessa stop seeing Hardin and to go back to Noah or else be cut off. Tessa becomes annoyed with Hardin's mood swings, but that night, passion leads them to have sex for the first time, causing Tessa to bleed from ill preparation.\nSeveral of Hardin\u2019s"

The title comes from one of the stories in the book with reference to the biblical Garden of Eden. The stories within the book range from traditional fiction (both of third and first person) to stories formatted more like a script. There is an abridged version on audiobook which includes 11 of the 14 stories read by famous actors, many of whom have starred in Coen brothers films. One story in the collection was adapted into a short film, A Fever in the Blood, released in 2002 and directed by Andrew Pulver.",

Begun by Grossman while Stalin was still alive, Life and Fate was his sequel to For a Just Cause. It was written in the 1950s and submitted for possible publication to Znamya magazine around October 1960. Very quickly after it was submitted, the KGB raided his apartment; the manuscripts, carbon copies and notebooks, as well as the typists' copies and even the typewriter ribbons were seized. The KGB did not know that he had left two copies of the manuscript with friends, one with the prominent poet Semyon Lipkin, a friend, and the other (Grossman's original manuscript) with Lyolya Klestova, often erroneously identified as Lyolya Dominikina, a friend from his university days.\nOn 23 July 1962, the Politburo ideology chief Mikhail Suslov told the author that, if published, his book could inflict even greater harm to the Soviet Union than Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago, speculating that it could begin a public discussion on the need for the Soviet Union. Suslov has been said to have told Grossman that his novel could not be published for two hundred years,; however more recent research amongst the documents of both Grossman and Suslov, in writing about this meeting, provide no evidence for this; they doubt that Suslov actually said this. Suslov's comment reveals both the presumption of the censor and recognition of the work's lasting significance. Grossman tried to appeal against this verdict to Khrushchev personally, unaware of Khrushchev's personal antagonism towards Grossman, and misunderstanding the climate of the time.\n\"I ask you to return freedom for my book, I ask that my book be discussed with editors, not the agents of the KGB. What is the point of me being physically free when the book I dedicated my life to is arrested... I am not renouncing it... I am requesting freedom for my book.\"\nIn 1974, Lipkin got one of the surviving copies to put onto microfilm and smuggled it out of the country with the help of satirical writer Vladimir Voinovich and nuclear scientist Andrei Sakharov. Grossman died in 1964, never having seen his book published, which did not happen in the West until 1980 at the publishing house L'Age d'homme, thanks to the efforts of Shimon Markish, professor of the University of Geneva and Efim Etkind (then in Paris) who achieved the meticulous work of reading from the microfilm.\nAs the policy of glasnost was initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, the novel was finally published on Russian soil in 1988 in the Oktyabr magazine and as a book.\nSome critics have compared Grossman's war novels, and specifically Life and Fate, with Leo Tolstoy's monumental work War and Peace. He had written to his daughter that War and Peace had been the only book he had been able to read during Stalingrad, but while there are similarities, it is recognized that, because Grossman actually witnessed the events of Stalingrad, there are many differences. Robert Chandler, who translated Life and Fate into English, while noting the comparison with Tolstoy, says that there is something Chekovian about his writing.\nIn Linda Grant's introduction to the 2011 Random House edition of the book, Grant says that Grossman never had the chance to edit his book; what Robert Chandler had to work with was a work that was \"a copy from an imperfect microfilm of an imperfect book\".\nMost of the events of Life and Fate take place in the Soviet Union during the late autumn and winter of 1942-43. It was the time of Operation Blue and Operation Fischreiher, the continuation into a second year of Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union that had started with Operation Barbarossa; it was the time of the Battle of Stalingrad. But, just as much as it takes place as a part of the Second World War, it takes place as part of the history of Stalinist Russia.\nHitler and Stalin had previously signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, which, on the face of it, seemed to be advantageous to both. However, on 22 June 1941, Hitler unilaterally terminated the pact by invading the Soviet Union. There has been much speculation on the Soviet response. But, whatever the reason for this response, they were not ready for what took place; the army had been seriously weakened by Stalin's purges of the army of the late 1930s, and the intelligence that was getting through to Stalin was filtered by their fear of having to tell Stalin things that he did not want to hear. So, though they had increased military spending, they did not yet have an army that could benefit from this. This was compounded by the change in command structure that Stalin initiated in the wake of the 1937"

He was one of the first journalists to write about the genocide of people in Eastern Europe and was present at many famous battles.

Gates of Fire is a 1998 historical fiction novel by Steven Pressfield that recounts the Battle of Thermopylae through Xeones, a perioikos (free but non-citizen inhabitant of Sparta) born in Astakos, and one of only three  Greek survivors of the battle.\nGates of Fire was on the Commandant of the Marine Corps' Reading list. It is taught at West Point, the United States Naval Academy, and at the Marine Corps The Basic School.\nThe novel stresses the literary themes of fate and irony as well as the military themes of honor, duty, stoicism, and esprit de corps.\nKirkus Reviews called it \"A triumph in historical fiction\".\nShortly after the release of the novel, George Clooney's production company, Maysville Pictures, acquired the rights for a film. David Self was brought on to write the screenplay, and Michael Mann was set to direct. The film suffered a troubled production. Mann departed the project citing creative differences, and it was later put on hold due to lukewarm critical reception for historical fiction films such as Troy, Alexander and King Arthur. After the release and success of 300, a film also based on the Battle of Thermopylae, plans for the Gates of Fire adaptation  were completely scrapped.\nNovelizations of the Battle of Thermopylae\n\"Gates of Fire\".

Appleton & Company. release_date: 1897. The story takes up immediately after the events of Looking Backward with the main characters from the first novel, Julian West, Doctor Leete, and his daughter Edith.\nWest tells his nightmare of return to the 19th century to Edith, who is sympathetic.  West's citizenship in the new America is recognized, and he goes to the bank to obtain his own account, or \"credit card,\" from which he can draw his equal share of the national product.  He learns that Edith and her mother do not normally wear the long skirts he has seen them in (they had been wearing them so as not to offend his 19th century sensibilities): when Julian tells Edith that he would not be shocked to see them dressed in the modern fashion, Edith immediately runs into the house and comes out dressed in a pants suit.  Clothing has revolutionised and is now made of strengthened paper, recycled when dirty, and replaced at very little cost (shoes and dishes are made of variations on the same substance).\nJulian learns that women are free to compete in many of the same trades as men; the manager of the paper factory he visits with Edith is a woman.  Edith herself is in the second year of the three year general labor period required of everyone before choosing a trade, but has taken leave to spend time with Julian.  The two tour a tenement house, in which no one now lives, kept as a reminder of the evils of private capitalism.\nJulian opens his safe (a device unknown in 2000 outside museums).  Dr. Leete sees his mortgages and securities not as long-obsolete claims to ownership interest in things, but rather in people and their labor.  The papers are worthless except as antiques, as most papers of the sort were burned at the conclusion of the economic transition, in a great blaze on the former site of the New York Stock Exchange.  The gold coins in the safe are admired for their prettiness, but are also worthless.\nJulian learns more about the world of the year 2000.  Handwriting has been virtually replaced by phonograph records, and jewelry is no longer used, since jewels are now worthless.  Julian is amazed by a television-like device, called the electroscope.  World communication is simplified, since everyone now speaks a universal language in addition to their native tongue.  Not only are there motor cars, but also private air cars.  Everyone is now vegetarian, and the thought of eating meat is looked upon with revulsion.\nThe book concludes with an almost uninterrupted series of lectures from Dr. Leete and other characters, mostly concerning how the idyllic state in which West has arrived was achieved.\nPower\n\"Government is actually now what it nominally was in the America of your day--the servant, tool, and instrument by which the people give effect to their will, itself being without will.\"\n\"Power over others is necessarily demoralizing to the master and degrading to the subject.\"\n\"It was not till the kings had been shorn of power and the interregnum of sham democracy had set in, leaving no virile force in the state or the world to resist the money power, that the opportunity for a world-wide plutocratic despotism arrived.\"\n\"Put workingmen in the places of the capitalists and they would have done just as the capitalists were doing. In fact, whenever workingmen did become capitalists they were commonly said to make the hardest sort of masters.\"\nWage slavery\n\"The slave received subsistence--clothing and shelter--and the wage-earner who could get more than these out of his wages was rarely fortunate. The rate of wages, except in new countries and under special conditions and for skilled workers, kept at about the subsistence point, quite as often dropping below as rising above. The main difference was that the master expended the subsistence wage of the chattel slave for him while the earner expended it for himself.\"\nDistribution of labor\n\"...the theory that a person has a right in dealing with his fellows to take advantage of his superior abilities is nothing other than a slightly more roundabout expression of the doctrine that might is right.\"\n\"Even the worker of special ability, who might hope to gain most by it, could not hope to gain so much as he would lose in common with others by sacrificing the increased efficiency of the industrial machinery that would result from the sentiment of solidarity and public spirit among the workers arising from a feeling of complete unity of interest.\"\n\"For the reason that there was no fair play or suggestion of justice in the distribution of work, everybody shirked it who could, and those who could not shirk it cursed the luckier ones and got even by doing as bad work as they could. Suppose a rich young fellow like myself had a feeling that he would like to do his part. How"

Firstborn is a fantasy novel by Paul B. Thompson and Tonya R. Carter which is set in the world of the Dragonlance campaign setting and is the first volume in the Elven Nations series.\nThis novel takes place in the ancient elven city of Silvanost, where twin sons are born to Sithel, Speaker of the Stars and ruler of all the elves. On that same night, a prophecy is made that \"They both shall wear crowns\"\u201d even though there can only be one ruler of the Silvanesti. Sithas, the elder, is raised as heir to the throne, and the younger Kith-Kanan is allowed the freedom typically afforded a second son. Sithas believes in the purity of the elven people and aligns himself with the aristocrats of the court in Silvanost, while Kith-Kanan believes the future of Silvanesti will be enhanced by trade with outsiders, including the humans of Ergoth. When their father dies in a hunting \u201caccident,\u201d Sithas becomes Speaker of the Stars, and Kith-Kanan must swear fealty to his brother, although he questions the stand Sithas has taken against the humans.\n\nHeeszel, Marlys (April 1991). \"Novel Ideas\".

The Man from Mars (Polish: Cz\u0142owiek z Marsa) is a \"first contact\" science fiction novel by Stanis\u0142aw Lem: American scientists are trying to deal with a creature in a crashed spaceship from Mars.\nIt was Stanislaw Lem's first science fiction work, serialized in a Katowice weekly, Nowy \u015awiat Przyg\u00f3d (\"New Adventure World\") in 1946, starting in the first issue. Lem considered it extremely naive and weak; he said he wrote it exclusively \"for bread\", and refused to reprint it for a long time.  Some Polish science fiction fanclubs produced small editions of pirated reprints. Later it was printed legally several times in Germany, where a publishing house had rights for Stanislaw Lem's juvenilia. The first legal Polish reprint, in book format, was published in 1994 by Independent Publishing House NOWA.\nIn 2009 for the first time a long excerpt from Chapter 1 was translated into English by Peter Swirski and published with permission of Stanislaw Lem's family in the online literary magazine Words Without Borders.\nDespite Lem's own critical attitude,  Jerzy Jarz\u0119bski notes that The Man from Mars is a smoothly written, readable novel that keeps the reader in suspense and does not abuse the technical jargon, although it is written following standard literary recipes, unlike later Lem's works, which break conventions and are full of intellectual challenges. \nAt the same time the novel sketches a number of ideas further elaborated by Lem in other works, most notably the concept of the inherent impossibility of communication between human and non-human intelligences, best known from his novel Solaris.\n\"From \"Nowy \u015awiat Przyg\u00f3d\u201d (\u201cNew World of Adventures\u201d) to \"\u015awiat M\u0142odych\u201d (\u201cThe Young People\u2019s World\u201d): The Evolution of a Cartoon Magazine for Children and Teenagers in 1946\u20131949\", by Adam Rusek, Rocznik Historii Prasy Polskiej, Vol XIV (2011) No. 1-2 (27-28), p .175 \nNote: Lem, in his commentary on the novel gives a different title of the weekly, Co Tydzie\u0144 Powie\u015b\u0107 (\"A Novel Every Week\"), printed by the same publisher in Katowice\nLem's commentary on the novel\nJerzy Jarz\u0119bski, Golem z Marsa (\"Golem from Mars\"), an afterword to the first official Polish print of The Man from Mars\n\"Man from Mars\", an excerpt (in English)\nEzra Glinter, \"The World According to Stanis\u0142aw Lem\", Los Angeles Review of Books, December 10, 2016"

Firstborn is a 2007 science fiction novel by British writers Arthur\u00a0C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter. It is the third book, billed as the conclusion of the A\u00a0Time Odyssey series.\nThe series contains hints about the Firstborn, who, in the early days of the universe, developed as the first intelligent beings. The Firstborn have calculated that to survive until the Big Rip, the Universe has sufficient energy to support only a limited number of civilizations. They take it upon themselves to ensure that the number of civilizations does not exceed this limit, and humanity is now in their sights.\nKirkus Reviews said \"readable, but more science travelogue than science fiction\u2014and if you were anticipating a conclusion, or at least an alien encounter, forget it.\" Publishers Weekly wrote \"the narrative leaps about too much to develop characters, but Clarke has never been as interested in individuals as in humanity's ability to accept change as a species. It's too early to tell whether that theme will be enough to carry the story to a coherent conclusion.\"\nDel Rey Online Catalog \u2013 hardcover edition\n\"FIRSTBORN: Book Three of A Time Odyssey\".

Timequake is a semi-autobiographical work by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. published in 1997. Marketed as a novel, the book was described as a \"stew\" by Vonnegut, in which he summarizes a novel he had been struggling with for a number of years.\nThe novel is divided into 63 chapters, seemingly arbitrarily. A new chapter rarely offers any sort of \"break\" with a previous one; in most cases a thought which was being discussed at the conclusion of the previous chapter continues uninterrupted in the next; chapter breaks are thus used no differently from paragraph breaks.\nTimequake, like many Vonnegut works, features a large number of double-spaced paragraph breaks and triple asterisks within each chapter, creating a constant sense of the author pausing between paragraphs.\nThough his tone is largely cynical throughout Timequake, Vonnegut frequently makes use of various light-hearted sayings, such as \"Hold on to your hats!\" or \"Get a load of this!\" when segueing between ideas. Several phrases are likewise continually repeated, such as \"ting-a-ling\" and \"he's up in heaven now.\"\nThe Art Brut song \"Late Sunday Evening\" uses Trout's mantra \"You were sick, but now you're well again, and there's work to do\" as its refrain.\nThe band I Would Set Myself on Fire for You uses a passage from Timequake at the beginning of their song, \"The First Word That Comes To Mind\"\".\nPhilip K. Dick's short story \"Breakfast at Twilight\", which was written in 1953, refers to a \"time quake\" having occurred, which has propelled a family seven years into the future.\nSayers, Valerie (1997-09-28). \"Vonnegut Stew\".

The Telling is a 2000 science fiction novel by Ursula K. Le Guin set in her fictional universe of Hainish Cycle. The Telling is Le Guin's first follow-up novel set in the Hainish Cycle since her 1974 novel The Dispossessed.  It tells the story of Sutty, a Terran sent to be an Ekumen observer, on the planet Aka, and her experiences of political and religious conflicts between a corporatist government and the indigenous resistance, which is centered on the traditions of storytelling, locally referred to as \"the Telling\" (for which the book is named).\nLe Guin constructed the recent historical situation of Aka as a parallel to the history of China during the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. The practice of the Telling is analogous to Taoist and Hindu practices and philosophy, and its suppression to the suppression of religious practices by the Chinese government at the time.\nThe Telling was published in 2000 as part of the Signed First Editions of Science Fiction series by Easton Press, who describe themselves as releasing 'works of lasting meaning, beauty and importance.'\nIt has been noted that The Telling is just as much a story about religion and politics as it is a story about storytelling.  It has also been noted as having a standard Le Guin writing approach because it has a clear outside observer/narrator and a setting that includes strongly contrasting civilizations.\nGerald Jonas, reviewing The Telling for The New York Times, found it to be \"an anthropological puzzle story\" but because the main character Sutty has little personal stake on Aka she comes across as \"little more than a mouthpiece for the author's personal vision of the good society.\"\nThe Telling won the Endeavour Award which recognizes distinguished novels or collections in 2001.  It also won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2001.\nThe Telling was translated into Hebrew as \u05d4\u05d4\u05d2\u05d3\u05d4 by Ornit Shachar (\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05d7\u05e8).\n\"sffworld.com synopsis of The Telling\".

Six months after its publication in book form in 1970 Soviet authorities attempted to remove it from libraries and bookshops after realizing that it contained a sharp criticism of the current state of affairs in the USSR disguised as a critique of \"Capitalism\" and Chinese-style communism of that time. It was published again in the 1980s \"perestrojka\" and thereafter.\nThis novel is considered a sequel to the 1957 novel Andromeda, taking place in the same universe some century or more later. Even though the cast of characters is entirely different, an occasional reference is made to the events and characters of the previous volume. For example, the main character in The Bull's Hour is a female historian who on one occasion remembers most of the notable Andromeda characters as historical figures.\nInferno, the Nature and Nature's way of death and suffering at the basis of life and development (evolution etc.).

The sending of the signal is described as taking an enormous amount of energy, on planetary scale, in order to reach even the closest neighboring civilization in the Ring.\nThe cardinal law of the Great Ring whereas any interference in a state's internal affairs is forbidden unless that civilization is impeding free access to the full, unaltered, non-filtered and non-distorted information for all and any of its subjects \u2013 in which case such a state is said to have no right to exist and the interference by the Great Ring is demanded to free its people and ensure their Right to Know and Right to Think: \n\"Not one state has such a right [to deny access to information], not one planet! The sacred duty of each of us is to contravene such an unprecedented oppression. Who dares block the way of a sentient reasoning being towards knowledge? ...  When in the Great Ring a state is discovered that blocks the way to knowledge for its people, such a state is dismantled. This is the only case that gives the right to interfere in the affairs of another planet. ... the prohibition to learn about arts, sciences, life on other planets, is unacceptable.\"\nSpanning approximately three thousand years from the 20th century to the present time of the novel, these are:\nThe Era of Disjoint World\nThe Era of World Reunion  \u00a0 (people of the world uniting together, creating the new society)\nThe Era of Common Labor  \u00a0 (the period of cleaning, improving and beautifying the Earth)\nThe Era of the Great Ring \u00a0 (started with the discovery of the Great Ring)\nThe Era of Meeting Hands  \u00a0 (started with the discovery of faster-than-light communications and travel)\nIt is hinted that a devastating world war has occurred between the eras of Disjoint World and World Reunion, nearly wiping out the Humanity.

Theodore Roosevelt was reelected President of the United States as the Progressive Party candidate in 1912, only to be assassinated on December 19, 1912 at the Chicago Union Stockyards by the sharpshooter and exhibition shooter Annie Oakley, before he took office, when personally breaking a labor strike with the help of the Rough Riders. Following this, his vice president, Charles Foster Kane takes power, and gradually leads the United States into greater levels of oppression, class division and bureaucratic incompetence and corruption \u2013 including an earlier entry into World War I in 1914 and the assassination of his rival candidate, Woodrow Wilson, during the 1916 election campaign.\nGradually, by 1917 the United States is unstable politically and socially, with overwhelming civil unrest stemming from the massive (and seemingly pointless) loss of American lives in the mud of the Western Front and the increasing gap between the wealthy 'robber barons' and the poor workers, and the massive corruption and exploitation this has resulted in. The Socialist Party of America led by Eugene V.

The plot is of the \"story within a story\" format. The actual story is told as an answer to a question asked in school at a lesson about the patterns of the development of societies. The story goes as follows.\nSome 3000 years in the future, a Communist Earth has just developed faster-than-light space travel based on the experiment of Ren Boz (from the Andromeda novel). Using the new technology, Earth constructs \"straight-beam\" starships which travel by sliding on the edge between our Universe (\"Shakti\") and the Anti-Universe (\"Tamas\"). The second ship of that kind, Dark Flame, departs from the Solar System on a mission to a habitable planet Tormance (named after the planet in A Voyage to Arcturus by David Lindsay\u2014whom Yefremov erroneously refers to as Arthur Lindsay) in the Lynx constellation, which was reported by alien space voyagers from Cepheus to be colonized by humans, thought to be Earth escapees from the Age before World Unification.\nThe society of this distant planet is labelled by Efremov as \"an amalgamation of a Capitalism in its worst form and of a Chinese pseudo-socialism\" and a part of \"Inferno\" (a deep philosophical concept of Efremov's relating to the Nature and the natural way of things, always as he claims infernal towards the living thinking sentient beings), a society in which ordinary workers' lives are limited to 26 local years (\"short-living\", KJI, or \u041a\u0416\u0418 for Russian: \"\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0416\u0418\u0432\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0435\") while scientists, engineers and other selected qualified professionals live out their natural lives (\"long-living\", DJI, or \u0414\u0416\u0418 for Russian: \"\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0416\u0418\u0432\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0435\"), with artists, sportspeople and \"models\" given somewhat longer life-spans than that of KJI (up to about 34 years). Both KJI and DJI are under the ruthless totalitarian control of the ruling class of government bureaucracy (\"snake-carriers\", similar to the prototypical \"inner-party members\" of Orwell's 1984) and the police forces (\"the lilac\"), which in turn are under the direct command of the Council of Four and its Chairman, the actual Ruler of the planet. The most shocking aspect of its civilization for the Earthlings is its total control of information, maintaining separate information systems for separate social strata, with full and true information available ultimately only to the Supreme Leader (who, for example, is the only one on the whole planet knowing that Tormance people are, in fact, from Earth).\nThe plot follows the Communist crew as they establish contact and explore the planet's society, eventually sacrificing some lives including that of the expedition leader, female historian Fay Rodis, for the sake of free future of the planet and its people. Their influence is predominantly through providing full and true information freely to all people about Earth's past and present, and their views of the situation on the planet. They also provide a selective short memory-eraser to be used against the system's spies by the nascent resistance. Also, some of the crew (esp. Rodis) have the mental capacity to do the same sort of influence without use of the device. Every member of the crew was also accompanied by a nine-legged discoid robot called SDF (Servant, Defender and Freighter).\nAs the Earth spaceship prepares to depart home, the astronavigator Vir Norin volunteers to stay and help the resistance fighters.\nAfter the story of Tormance has been told in the classroom it was clarified by the teacher that the contact with the Earth people had eventually indeed helped the people of Tormance to achieve Freedom. Now, some 130 years after the events, the Earth had just received a message from the Tormancians, and a starship from one of Earth colonies was being prepared to be sent to Tormance.\nInferno, the Nature and Nature's way of death and suffering at the basis of life and development (evolution etc.).

Theodore Roosevelt was reelected President of the United States as the Progressive Party candidate in 1912, only to be assassinated on December 19, 1912 at the Chicago Union Stockyards by the sharpshooter and exhibition shooter Annie Oakley, before he took office, when personally breaking a labor strike with the help of the Rough Riders. Following this, his vice president, Charles Foster Kane takes power, and gradually leads the United States into greater levels of oppression, class division and bureaucratic incompetence and corruption \u2013 including an earlier entry into World War I in 1914 and the assassination of his rival candidate, Woodrow Wilson, during the 1916 election campaign.\nGradually, by 1917 the United States is unstable politically and socially, with overwhelming civil unrest stemming from the massive (and seemingly pointless) loss of American lives in the mud of the Western Front and the increasing gap between the wealthy 'robber barons' and the poor workers, and the massive corruption and exploitation this has resulted in. The Socialist Party of America led by Eugene V. Debs gains increasing support, and soon the unrest has led to a Second American Revolution and Second American Civil War, following which Kane is ousted from the White House, overthrown, and executed for treason. Afterwards, a new socialist order, led by Debs, takes over. The United States of America becomes the United Socialist States of America.\nThe early idealism of this change is misplaced, however; upon Debs' death in 1926, power is seized by Al Capone (an obvious parallel to Joseph Stalin, just as Debs is used to mirror the achievements of Vladimir Lenin), who proceeds to rule over the USSA with a brutal, repressive fist of iron, establishing a cult of personality around himself, exiling and executing his political rivals and ruling the country more brutally and ruthlessly (and incompetently) than any of the robber barons who were previously deposed. Gradually, following World War II, the Cold War between the USSA, the United Kingdom and a semi-constitutional monarchist Russian Empire, and the war in Indo-China (a Vietnam War-like affair in which armies from Russia and Great Britain attempted to support a somewhat democratic regime under attack from USSA-backed Communist guerillas), the USSA begins to stagnate economically and socially, before finally collapsing into separate, bickering nations by 1991, leading to an uncertain future for both the former USSA and the rest of the world.\nIn the Air: 1989.

S. Naipaul's father, Seepersad Naipaul) is born in rural Trinidad and Tobago to Hindu Indian parents and his father is a Brahmin. His birth was considered inauspicious as he is born \"in the wrong way\" and with an extra finger. A pundit prophesies that the newborn child \"will be a lecher and a spendthrift. Possibly a liar as well\", and that he will \"eat up his mother and father\". The pundit advises that the boy be kept \"away from trees and water. Particularly water\". A few years later, Mohun leads a neighbour's calf, which he is tending, to a stream. The boy, who has never seen water \"in its natural form\", becomes distracted and allows the calf to wander off. Mohun then hides in fear of punishment. His father, believing his son to be in the water, drowns in an attempt to save him, thus in part fulfilling the pundit's prophecy. This leads to the dissolution of the family. Mohun's sister is sent to live with a wealthy aunt and uncle, Tara and Ajodha. Mohun, his mother, and two older brothers go to live with other relatives.\nThe boy is withdrawn prematurely from school and apprenticed to a pundit, but is cast out on bad terms. Ajodha then puts him in the care of his alcoholic and abusive brother Bhandat, an arrangement which also ends badly. Finally, the young Mr Biswas decides to make his own fortune. He encounters a friend from his school days who helps him get into the business of sign-writing. While on the job, Mr Biswas attempts to romance a client's daughter but his advances are misinterpreted as a wedding proposal. He is drawn into a marriage which he does not have the nerve to stop and becomes a member of the Tulsi household.\nMr Biswas becomes very unhappy with his wife Shama (based on Droapatie Naipaul) and her overbearing family. The Tulsis (based on the Capildeo family), and the big decaying Hanuman House (based on Anand Bhavan aka the Lion House) where they live represent the communal way of life which is traditional throughout Asia. Mr Biswas is offered a place in this cosmos, a subordinate place to be sure, but a place that is guaranteed and from which advancement is possible. But Mr Biswas wants more than being just a gharjamai. He is, by instinct, a modern man. He wants to be the author of his own life. That is an aspiration with which the Tulsis cannot deal, and their decaying world conspires to drag him down. Despite his poor education, Mr Biswas becomes a journalist, has four children with Shama, and attempts several times to build a house that he can call his own, a house which will symbolise his independence. Mr Biswas' desperate struggle to acquire a house of his own can be linked to an individual's need to develop an authentic identity. He feels that only by having his own house he can overcome his feelings of rootlessness and alienation.\nMohun Biswas (based on V. S. Naipaul's father, Seepersad Naipaul)\nShama (based on Droapatie Naipaul), Mohun's wife\nRaghu, Mohun's father\nTara, Mohun's mother's sister\nBhandat, Tara's brother-in-law\nPundit Jayaram, Mohun's cruel employer, with whom he worked as an assistant\nMrs. Tulsi, Shama's mother\nAnand, Mohun's son (based on V. S. Naipaul). Anand excels in school and shows signs of talent as a writer.\nNaipaul wrote the book based on his own experiences as a child. Writing for The New York Review of Books in 1983, he stated that, \"Of all my books A House for Mr. Biswas is the one closest to me.\" The book took him three years to write.\nNaipaul finished the final proofreading of the book in May 1961. The book was first published in London by Andr\u00e9 Deutsch in 1961. McGraw Hill published the first US edition of the book in New York in the same year.\nA central theme of the novel is alienation. Right from his birth, Mr Biswas is alienated due to the prophecy. He grew up as a lonely child who lived in isolation. Following his marriage to Shama, the joint family of the Tulsis expected him to merge his personal identity with theirs, which he finds difficult and makes him feel trapped. They later humiliate him and he is forced to work at the estate at Green Vale, where he grows resentful of even his own children. Ultimately, this sense of alienation motivates him to search for a house, symbolising an effort to find and create his own identity.\nThroughout the novel, Mr Biswas' gradual progress is indicated through the many objects he and his wife acquire over the years. Naipaul lists out detailed inventories, much like \"the catalogue of ships in the Iliad or the many descriptions of rooms by Dickens\".\nThe novel is generally regarded as Naipaul's most significant work and is credited with launching him into international fame and renown.\nTime magazine"

The Gladiator follows the same concept as the other Crosstime Traffic novels. A parallel world similar in most respects to our own has discovered the technology to visit and trade with other parallels, spreading the notions of liberty and capitalism at the same time.\nThe plot of The Gladiator follows the same formula of the other books in the series with an imperiled company operative and local protagonists being used as guides to the parallel. In The Gladiator, it is indeed the capitalist West that has been consigned to the \"dustbin of history\" and the world has been remade in the image of the Soviet Union. The point of divergence from ours was in 1962. U.S. President John F. Kennedy decides to allow the Soviet missiles to remain in Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the complete withdrawal from the Vietnam War in 1968. Thus, communism spreads throughout Latin America and Southeast Asia giving the Soviet Union an upper hand in economic and military strength over the United States. Due to the embargo of the many countries that were integrated into the Soviet Sphere, the United States' economy collapses and goes bankrupt and loses its position as a superpower, and most European countries become communist afterward in the 1980s and 1990s, including France and Italy. A hundred years later, communism has taken over nearly every world country (including the United States itself). Capitalism at large has largely been killed off, though small ventures of capitalism had to be kept as a necessary evil. Religion, despite communism's taboo against it, has been relatively untouched in countries such as Italy, where even the staunchest Italian communist was known to attend a Catholic Mass.\nThe protagonists of the novel, Gianfranco and Annarita, are teenagers in an Italian People's Republic, satellite to the interests of the USSR. Amidst the grey Soviet Brutalist tenements, they discover a strategy game shop that is disseminating capitalist ideas with the games they sell. The shop is a front for the Crosstime Traffic trading monopoly, as the protagonists discover when the shop is closed by the authorities and one of the clerks, Eduardo, turns to the protagonists for help.\n\"Uchronia: Crosstime Traffic Series\". www.uchronia.net.\n\"Fantastic Fiction.com The Gladiator\".\nPrometheus Winners\nThe Gladiator review by Silver\nThe Gladiator review at Fantastic Fiction\nThe Gladiator review at SciFi Dimensions"

Arabella is a Regency romance novel written by Georgette Heyer. It records the plight of a relatively poor girl from the English gentry who captures the attention of a very wealthy man by claiming to be an heiress; although he disbelieves her, he is amused by her presumption and character. The story is set in the spring of 1817.\nMukul Kesavan of The Telegraph observed similarities between the character of Arabella and many of Heyer's other Regency heroines: while they all travel to London to find wealthy husbands, they do so on their own terms. Kesavan said, \n\"The remarkable thing about Heyer\u2019s Regency novels is the way in which her heroines manage not to dance the marriage minuet, their awkward refusal to 'fit' the model of the eager, conforming debutante. Her heroines aren\u2019t revolutionaries or even proto-feminists: they accept the mannered marriage market as the way of the world, but they work to make room for themselves and their natures within its constraints.\"\n\nWriting for Tor.com, Mari Ness stated that Arabella was notable for being one of the few of Heyer's novels to depict real signs of poverty. Ness wrote that Heyer \n\"decided to introduce a touch\u2014a mere touch\u2014of poverty, as if to acknowledge that even in the idealistic Regency world of her creation, genuine, real poverty could appear. And as if to immediately soften this, she surrounded this poverty with witty dialogue, romantic banter, and what by all appearances is the expected romantic ending.\"\n In a 1949 review, The New York Times critiqued the novel for showing \"no sign of the rough and sordid London of Swift and Defoe... Nor is there the least sign of the robustness and vitality that made those masters' creations come to life... Arabella and the Nonesuch are stereotypes from The Ladies Monthly Museum.\"\nNess considers Arabella to be a fan favourite, \"with passages that are among [Heyer's] very best, and some of her most ironic writing. And up until those last pages, it is one of Heyer\u2019s most delightful, comforting novels, filled with laugh out loud moments and sharp comments on human behavior.\" Ness disliked the ending, especially as it seems that Beaumaris' will and superior social standing will be employed to overrule his new wife's criticism of London Society and willingness to aid the downridden.\nSally Houghton. \"Heyer Novel Chronology\".

Juliette is a novel written by the Marquis de Sade and published 1797\u20131801, accompanying Sade's 1797 version of his novel Justine. While Justine, Juliette's sister, was a virtuous woman who consequently encountered nothing but despair and abuse, Juliette is an amoral nymphomaniac murderer who is successful and happy. The full title of the novel in the original French is L'Histoire de Juliette ou les Prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9s du vice, and the English title is \"Juliette, or Vice Amply Rewarded\" (versus \"Justine, or Good Conduct Well-Chastised\"). As many other of his works, Juliette follows a pattern of violently pornographic scenes followed by long treatises on a broad range of philosophical topics, including theology, morality, aesthetics, naturalism and also Sade's dark, fatalistic view of world metaphysics.\nA long audience with Pope Pius VI is one of the more extensive scenes in Juliette. The heroine repeatedly addresses the Pope by his legal name \"Braschi.\" She also flaunts her learning with a verbal, yet highly detailed, catalogue of alleged immoralities committed by his papal predecessors. Their conversation ends (like nearly every scene in the narrative) with an orgy, in which Pope Pius is portrayed as a secret libertine.\nSoon after this, the male character Brisatesta narrates two scandalous encounters. The first is with \"Princess Sophia, niece of the King of Prussia,\" who has just married \"the Stadtholder\" at the Hague. This is a presumed reference to Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange, who married  the last Dutch Stadtholder, William V of Orange in 1767, and was still alive when Juliette was published thirty years later. The second encounter is with Catherine the Great, the Empress of Russia.\nBoth Justine and Juliette were published anonymously. Napoleon ordered the arrest of the author, and as a result de Sade was incarcerated without trial for the last thirteen years of his life.\nThe essay (Excursus II) \"Juliette or Enlightenment and Morality\" in Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947) analyzes Juliette as the embodiment of the philosophy of enlightenment. They write: \"she demonizes Catholicism as the most-up-to-date mythology -- and along with it, civilization as a whole. Her comportment is enlightened and efficient as she goes about her work of sacrilege \u2026 She favours system and consequence.\"\nJustine Paris\nJuliette. Translated by Wainhouse, Austryn. 1968.

Villette (/vi\u02d0\u02c8l\u025bt/) is an 1853 novel written by English author Charlotte Bront\u00eb. After an unspecified family disaster, the protagonist Lucy Snowe travels from her native England to the fictional French-speaking city of Villette to teach at a girls' school, where she is drawn into adventure and romance.\nVillette was Charlotte Bront\u00eb's third and last novel published during her life. It was preceded in writing by The Professor (her posthumously published first novel, of which Villette is a reworking), Jane Eyre, and Shirley.\nIn 1842 Charlotte Bront\u00eb, at the age of 26, travelled to Brussels, Belgium, with her sister Emily. There they enrolled in a pensionnat (boarding school) run by M. and Mme. Constantin H\u00e9ger. In return for board and tuition, Charlotte taught English and Emily taught music.\nThe sisters' time at the pensionnat was cut short when their aunt, Elizabeth Branwell, died in October 1842. Elizabeth had joined the Bront\u00eb family to care for the children after the death of her sister, their mother Maria Bront\u00eb, n\u00e9e Maria Branwell.\nCharlotte returned, alone, to Brussels in January 1843 to take up a teaching post at the pensionnat. Her second stay in Brussels was not a happy one. She became lonely and homesick, and fell in love with M. H\u00e9ger, a married man. She finally returned to her family's rectory in Haworth, England, in January 1844.\nCharlotte drew on this source material for her first (albeit unsuccessful) novel The Professor. After several publishers had rejected it, Bront\u00eb reworked the material and made it the basis of Villette. Most literary historians believe that the character of M. Paul Emanuel is closely based upon that of M. H\u00e9ger. Furthermore, the character of Graham Bretton is widely acknowledged to have been modelled upon Bront\u00eb's publisher, George Murray Smith.\nThe novel is initially set in the English countryside, and later follows Lucy Snowe to the fictional Belgian town of Villette, a Gothic town where the majority of the action takes place. Villette is modelled upon the city of Brussels and is set in the fictional kingdom of Labassecour (modelled on Belgium). \"Labassecour\" is the French word for farmyard.\nLucy Snowe: The narrator and main character of Villette. A quiet, self-reliant, intelligent, 23-year-old woman. Lucy has, as Miss Ginevra Fanshawe asserts, \"no attractive accomplishments \u2013 no beauty\" as Lucy does her best not to stand out or form attachments. Although she seems to lack any living relatives, she is the god-daughter of Mrs. Bretton.\nThough usually reserved and emotionally self-controlled, Lucy has strong feelings and affections for those whom she really values. She even sincerely cares for the giddy Ginevra, albeit in a blunt, curmudgeonly fashion. She is a firm Protestant and denounces Roman Catholicism as false (\"God is not with Rome\"). She falls in love with M. Emanuel and consents to marry him someday. With his help Lucy leaves Mme Beck's and establishes her own school.\nM. Paul Emanuel: An irascible, autocratic professor at Mme. Beck's pensionnat. He is also a relative of Mme. Beck. Although he insults Lucy frequently, Lucy comes to relish his good qualities. He is generous; he delights in giving Lucy secret presents. He is kind and magnanimous, as is shown by his supporting and sheltering the elderly grandmother of his dead fianc\u00e9e, Justine Marie, together with his former tutor (P\u00e9re Silas) and a servant. He is a devout Catholic and tries to convert Lucy, a Protestant, to Catholicism but fails. As he grows closer to Lucy and falls in love with her everyone in his life attempts to keep them apart, and he is eventually banished to a family-owned plantation in Guadeloupe for three years. At the end of the novel, it is strongly hinted that he dies in a shipwreck attempting to return to Belgium.\nDr. John Graham Bretton: A handsome young English gentleman who is a physician. He is the son of Lucy's godmother, Mrs. Bretton. He is described as \"cheerful,\" \"benignant,\" and \"bland.\" Lucy, when young, showed no particular fondness for him. However, when they meet again ten years later, their cool friendship is more than rekindled, and Lucy secretly begins to cherish an affection for him. Graham does not return this affection, however, and calls her \"quiet Lucy Snowe\" and \"a being inoffensive as a shadow.\" He has, at first, a passion for Ginevra Fanshawe, until her love of money and a sneer at Mrs. Bretton quenches his love at last. He then falls in love with Polly de Bassompierre. Lucy conquers her love for him and buries all his"

Juliette is a novel written by the Marquis de Sade and published 1797\u20131801, accompanying Sade's 1797 version of his novel Justine. While Justine, Juliette's sister, was a virtuous woman who consequently encountered nothing but despair and abuse, Juliette is an amoral nymphomaniac murderer who is successful and happy. The full title of the novel in the original French is L'Histoire de Juliette ou les Prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9s du vice, and the English title is \"Juliette, or Vice Amply Rewarded\" (versus \"Justine, or Good Conduct Well-Chastised\"). As many other of his works, Juliette follows a pattern of violently pornographic scenes followed by long treatises on a broad range of philosophical topics, including theology, morality, aesthetics, naturalism and also Sade's dark, fatalistic view of world metaphysics.\nA long audience with Pope Pius VI is one of the more extensive scenes in Juliette. The heroine repeatedly addresses the Pope by his legal name \"Braschi.\" She also flaunts her learning with a verbal, yet highly detailed, catalogue of alleged immoralities committed by his papal predecessors. Their conversation ends (like nearly every scene in the narrative) with an orgy, in which Pope Pius is portrayed as a secret libertine.\nSoon after this, the male character Brisatesta narrates two scandalous encounters. The first is with \"Princess Sophia, niece of the King of Prussia,\" who has just married \"the Stadtholder\" at the Hague. This is a presumed reference to Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange, who married  the last Dutch Stadtholder, William V of Orange in 1767, and was still alive when Juliette was published thirty years later. The second encounter is with Catherine the Great, the Empress of Russia.\nBoth Justine and Juliette were published anonymously. Napoleon ordered the arrest of the author, and as a result de Sade was incarcerated without trial for the last thirteen years of his life.\nThe essay (Excursus II) \"Juliette or Enlightenment and Morality\" in Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947) analyzes Juliette as the embodiment of the philosophy of enlightenment. They write: \"she demonizes Catholicism as the most-up-to-date mythology -- and along with it, civilization as a whole. Her comportment is enlightened and efficient as she goes about her work of sacrilege \u2026 She favours system and consequence.\"\nJustine Paris\nJuliette. Translated by Wainhouse, Austryn. 1968.

The novel, Ellis' second, was released on 1 January 2013 through Mulholland Books, and reached The New York Times Best Seller list. It follows Detective John Tallow as he becomes involved in a mystery surrounding several unsolved homicides. Ellis intended the book to serve as a contrast to police procedurals such as CSI, which he dubbed \"bedtime stories\".\nTelevision rights have been sold to 20th Century Fox TV and Chernin Entertainment.\n\nEllis has confirmed that rights for Gun Machine have been purchased by the 20th Century Fox TV and Chernin Entertainment, with the intent of turning it into a television series. He also confirmed that he would serve as executive producer for the potential series along with Dario Scardapane, Peter Chernin and Katherine Pope.

Ellis will executive produce along with Brett Conrad, who has signed on to write the pilot.\nTrailers for Gun Machine, one of which was narrated by Wil Wheaton, were released shortly after the book's street date. The trailers were well received, with io9 calling the second trailer \"creeptastic\".\nCritical reception for Gun Machine has been mostly positive, with The A.V. Club giving the book a \"B\" rating. The New York Times gave a mixed review, calling it a \"pleasingly quirky crime thriller\" while stating that the ending felt \"a little unsatisfying\" due to how neatly everything was wrapped up.

Sixth Column, also known under the title The Day After Tomorrow, is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, based on a story by editor John W. Campbell, and set in a United States that has been conquered by the PanAsians, who are asserted to be neither Japanese nor Chinese. Originally published as a serial in Astounding Science Fiction (January, February, March 1941, using the pen name Anson MacDonald) it was published in hardcover in 1949. It is most known for its race-based premise.\nThe idea for the story of Sixth Column was proposed by John W. Campbell, who had written a similar unpublished story called \"All\". Heinlein would later write that he \"had to reslant it to remove racist aspects of the original story line\" and he would also have to write that he did not \"consider it to be an artistic success.\"\nHeinlein's work on Campbell's \"All\" was considerably more than just a re-slanting; Campbell's story was felt to be unpublishable as it stood, written in a pseudo-archaic dialect (sometimes inconsistently), and provided no scientific explanations for miraculous powers of the American super-weapons, which the PanAsians have no explanation for other than to conclude that weapons' powers must be divine. Science fiction writer-critic George Zebrowski believed that Heinlein intended the novel's Calhoun, who, after going insane, believes the false religion created by the Americans, as a parody of Campbell himself. The bulk of Heinlein's work on the novel, e.g. the explanations of the weapons\u2019 effectiveness and the strategy for the Americans' rebellion, is not present in \"All\".\nBoucher and McComas found the novel to be \"a fine example of serious pulp science fiction.\" P. Schuyler Miller compared Sixth Column to \"the old E. Phillips Oppenheim or modern Eric Ambler intrigue, thrust and counterthrust with civilization at stake.\"\nThe book was serialized in early 1941, at a time that the Second Sino-Japanese War was in its fourth year and large parts of China had been occupied in brutal fashion by the Japanese. The book is notable for its frank portrayal of racism on both sides. The conquerors regard themselves as a chosen people predestined to rule over lesser races, and they refer to white people as slaves. \"Three things only do slaves require: work, food, and their religion.\" They demand outward signs of respect, such as jumping promptly into the gutter when a member of the chosen race walks by, and the slightest hesitation to show the prescribed courtesies earns a swagger stick across the face. One character is Frank Mitsui, an Asian American whose family was murdered by the invaders because they did not fit in the new PanAsiatic racial order. The Americans in the novel respond to their conquerors' racism by often referring to them in unflattering terms, such as \"flat face\" and \"slanty\".\nSixth Column and Farnham's Freehold, another novel by Heinlein, both center on the issue of race.\nRobert A.

Almost everyone carries an identification card or a radio-frequency identification chip implanted under the skin. The chip can be read by the Eye system, \"allowing the government to track physical movement and determine if an individual is operating outside of his/her normal parameters.\"\nIn addition, robots are beginning to replace the human work force. There is growing unemployment and neo-Luddite group called \"The Sons of Ned\" organizes demonstrations and commits acts of violence. In her New York Times review, Janet Maslin pointed out that Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019s famous statement Cogito, ergo sum \"comes up repeatedly as a matter of crucial important in a world where artificial intelligence grows more powerful every day.\"\nThe book is a first person novel narrated by Jacob Underwood, a man who has suffered a severe brain injury after a motorcycle accident. Underwood suffers from Cotard delusion, a real-life neurological condition in which the afflicted person thinks that he or she is dead. He has created an elaborate epistemological system based on his belief that he is a \"Shell\" (a body) that contains a \"Spark\" (his conscious self). \nUnderwood is hired by the Brooks Danford Group, a New York investment bank, to work as an assassin, eliminating threats to the bank's clients. \"Underwood\u2019s strength as a hired killer is the emotionless, robotic nature that allows him to operate with logical, ruthless precision.\"\nMiss Holquist is Underwood's handler at the bank (she never reveals her real name). Although she has two daughters\u2014one about to be married\u2014she is a ruthless individual who has no belief in any kind of larger morality. In a crucial speech, she reduces that world to sub-atomic particles: \u201cEverything that goes on in the universe is a physical process that involves boson particles that have an integer spin such as one or two, and fermion particles that have odd, half-integer spins.\u201d\nEmily Buchanan is young executive working for the investment bank that disappears with some top secret information. She turns out to be involved with \"anti-social\" groups that are opposed to the system of government control and surveillance.\nCritical reaction to Spark was generally positive.\nIn a starred review in Booklist, reviewer David Pitt wrote: \"It\u2019s been several years since the Fourth Realm trilogy ended, and some readers might have wondered if the author had only one story to tell. But guess what? As good as the Fourth Realm books were, this one may be even more appealing: less fantastic, more grounded in a contemporary real world, with a narrator who is deeply scarred and endlessly fascinating.\"\nIn her Washington Post review, Nancy Hightower wrote that the novel \"is a fantastic blend of action and deeper questions about what it means to be human.\"\nIn October, 2013 Deadline reported that the film rights to Spark were sold to DreamWorks.\n\"'Spark,' the Latest Dystopian Novel From John Twelve Hawks\". www.nytimes.com. 2014-10-06.

The book is written in the form of a journal kept by Catherine Hall, a young girl living in a rural village in New England with her widower father and younger sister. The journal details her daily life between the years of 1830 and 1832. Among the events of these two years are several that would have a profound impact on the rest of her life. These include her assistance to an escaped slave, her father's remarriage, and the sudden death of her best friend.",

Catherine, called Cath by her friends, is thirteen at the start of the book, and has a birthday in May, so for most of the journal she is thirteen. Her best friend is Cassie, who dies during the course of the journal.\nCatherine has a younger sister, Matty. Her mother died four years before the journal takes place. Her father remarried in May 1831, and his wife, a widow, brought her own son to live with them, Daniel. They all figured out how to be a family and Catherine learns to love her new stepmom.\nCassie is Catherine's best friend. She is a year older than Catherine, fourteen, but the girls are the same height. She has three brothers: David Horatio (two years older), Asa Hale (Catherine's age), and William Mason, the baby. In the summer of 1831, Cassie is suddenly struck with a high fever.  Her condition worsens over the next nine days, and she dies in her sleep on August 20, 1831.\nIn her 1899 letter to her great-granddaughter, Catherine says of her dear childhood friend, \"of all of us, the only one never to grow old.\"\nAt the time of the book's publication, Kirkus Reviews said, \"The tone is suitably restrained, and the language, which means to mimic accurately the speech and writing patterns of the period, is so awkwardly formal at times that to follow it the reader must be sharply attentive. The reward is a warm and interesting glimpse into a past way of life dependent on the close society of neighbors, friends, and family. Carefully researched and convincingly delivered.\" In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1976 to 1985, literary critic Zena Sutherland wrote, \"Catherine's journal shows her reflection of diverse viewpoints about runaway slaves, and it makes reference to recorded history; but the details that indicate historical research on the author's part are never obtrusive, and they do not dominate the story by clogging the narrative flow. In sum, this is a book set in a historical period, but it is not a book about nineteenth-century New Hampshire: It is a book about a human being.\"\nFrom 1980 to 1983 in National Book Award history there were dual awards for hardcover and paperback books in many categories. Almost all of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including the 1980 children's paperback.\n\"National Book Awards \u2013 1980\". National Book Foundation.

The only novel written by Quevedo, it is presented in the first person singular and chronicles the adventures of Don Pablos, a busc\u00f3n or swindler.  Pablos sets out in life with two aims: to learn virtue and to become a caballero (gentleman).  He fails miserably in both.\nEl Busc\u00f3n has been considered a profound satire on Spanish life, but also as a literary exercise for Quevedo, in that he was able to utilize word-play and verbal flourishes and his skill as a literary caricaturist.  El Busc\u00f3n also propounds the notion that children of parents without honor will never be able to achieve honor themselves.\nC. Brian Morris has written that Quevedo pursues Pablos with a series of \"desgracias...encadenadas\" (\"linked calamities\").  James Iffland describes these \"linked calamities\" as a \"torturously up and down, bouncing trajectory which marks Pablos's career from the outset.\"\nQuevedo satirizes Spanish society, but also attacks Pablos himself, who attempts throughout the novel to achieve a higher station in life and become a gentleman.  Such aspirations from the lower classes would only destabilize the social order, in Quevedo's eyes.  Quevedo punishes Pablos for attempting to better himself.  \"For Pablos, human society is the only reality.  He knows no other.  He is young, innocent, a little foolish.\"  Eventually, Pablos is driven to become a p\u00edcaro, or rogue.\nThe work also incorporates autobiographical elements.  In 1608, Quevedo dueled with the writer and fencing master Luis Pacheco de Narv\u00e1ez as a result of Quevedo criticizing one of his works. Quevedo took off Pacheco's hat in the first encounter.  They were enemies all their lives.  In El Busc\u00f3n, this duel is parodied with a fencer relying on mathematical calculations having to run away from a duel with an experienced soldier.\nQuevedo makes an early references to the effects of syphilis when he puns in his Busc\u00f3n about a nose entre Roma y Francia meaning both \"between Rome and France\" and \"between dull and eaten by the French illness\".\nPicaresque works are valuable linguistically because they record the argot of many sectors of society -both the language of the antihero and the criminals the antihero meets on his travels.  Quevedo's novel gives a considerable amount of information about German\u00eda, or Thieves' cant.\nThe novel is divided into three books.  Book One is divided into seven chapters; Book Two is divided into six chapters; Book Three has ten chapters.  One scholar has argued that the structure Quevedo adopts is not one of randomness and Pablos the focus around whom a series of satirical characters and situations group.  Instead, \"Busc\u00f3n has a unity and coherence created by something other than the hero's presence, for an orderly train of misfortunes, which connects network of recurring motifs...\"  These motifs include the closely related themes of family, filth, and legal and lawless cruelty.\nPablos is first introduced as a child.  His father, Clemente Pablo, is a barber and a thief.  His mother, Aldonza, is a prostitute and a witch.  It is implied that she is a Morisco; Pablos writes: Sospech\u00e1base en el pueblo que no era cristiana vieja (\"It was whispered in town that she was not an old Christian [i.e. a \"new Christian,\" a recent convert to Christianity].\")  Pablos' brother, also a thief, was flogged to death in prison.  Pablos wishes to go to school, and his parents agree to let him go.  At school, he befriends a boy named Don Diego Coronel, but Pablos suffers various setbacks there.  Pablos decides to neither return to school nor home, and remains as the friend and companion of Don Diego, who also decides to leave school.  Diego\u2019s father, Don Alonso, decides to make both boys wards of a man named D\u00f3mine Cabra, in Segovia.  The two boys suffer from hunger at the hands of Cabra.  When another boy dies of starvation, Alonso removes both boys from the school and sends them off to Alcal\u00e1 to study.  On their way there, they stop at an inn, where Pablos is mocked and hazed by a group of students.  At Alcal\u00e1, since Pablos is not a gentleman, he is separated from Don Diego, and is hazed and beaten by some university students.  During the night, he is beaten again by four students who shared a room with him.  Pablos then acts out, killing some pigs that did not belong to him, and puts on a party, tricking his landlady into giving him two chickens.  He also robs some sweets from a local merchant and some swords from the rector and a justice of the peace.  His friends laugh at his antics.\nPablos then receives a letter that his father has been hanged and his mother imprisoned."

Having sold his Glasgow grocery-store business, 55-year-old Dickson McCunn decides to start his retirement with a walking holiday in the district of Carrick in Galloway.  At a local inn he meets John Heritage, a poet and ex-soldier, as well as an unnamed young man who asks after a place called 'Darkwater' that nobody has heard of.\nMcCunn and Heritage decide to spend the next night at the village of Dalquaharter where they are taken in by a local widow, Phemie Morran.  They investigate the local big house, Huntingtower, where \u2013 although the place is ostensibly empty \u2013 they hear a woman singing. Heritage recognises the voice as that of a Russian princess he had fallen in love with from afar when his battalion had been posted to Rome some years earlier.\nOn a camping holiday nearby are the Gorbals Die-Hards, a group of street urchins from Glasgow that McCunn had recently supported via a contribution to a charity fund. Their leader, Dougal Crombie, tells them that two women are being kept prisoner. They get into the house and find Saskia, princess of one of the great families of Russia, and her elderly cousin Eug\u00e8nie. Saskia explains that she is a fugitive from Bolshevik elements in Russia, and that she came to Huntingtower at the invitation of its owner, her childhood friend Quentin Kennedy. On arrival she was betrayed by the corrupt local factor, James Loudon, and was taken prisoner. She fears the imminent arrival of a man who is likely to kill her \u2013 later disclosed as the Bolshevik leader Paul Abreskov. She is desperately hoping for the appearance of a 'friend' to whom she has sent word (Alexis Nicolaevich, her fianc\u00e9).\nSaskia has been placed in charge of her family\u2019s jewels, and McCunn agrees to deposit them with his local bank in Glasgow. They learn that Paul's followers are expected to arrive by sea in a Danish brig. Heritage is left alone in the Old Tower nearby to act as a decoy.\nMcCunn speaks to a local English landowner, Sir Archibald Roylance, who asks the chief constable for police help. After being rescued from an ambush by Wee Jaikie, the youngest of the Die-Hards, McCunn stumbles alone through the woods and comes across a man with a motorcycle whom he recognises from the inn. He is Saskia\u2019s fianc\u00e9 Alexis, who has been delayed searching for 'Darkwater' rather than Dalquaharter.\nThe men from the brig surround the Old Tower and Heritage flutters a scarf at a window to make it appear that Saskia is there. The attackers explode a bomb to force entry, setting the tower alight. Saskia shows herself at a distance then runs back to Huntingtower, helped by Alexis who has just arrived.  Their position looks hopeless as the enemy, commanded now by Paul Abreskov, force their way in through the downstairs windows. The Die-Hards get in among the attackers and shout and blow whistles pretending to be the police. In the stormy darkness, panic ensues and the attackers flee to their boats. The vessels founder in the storm and most of the enemy, including Abreskov, perish.\nMcCunn decides that he would like to do something practical to help the Die-Hard boys and he resolves to pay for their future educations.  Meanwhile, Heritage is reconciled that Saskia has found her true mate in Alexis and that she can never be his. On recovering the family\u2019s jewels, Saskia gives one of them to McCunn as a memento. He in turn gives it to his wife.\n\nDickson McCunn, wealthy retired 55-year-old Glasgow grocer\nJohn Heritage, young English poet and ex-soldier\nDougal Crombie, leader of the Gorbals Die-Hards\nJaikie Galt ('Wee Jaikie'), small, but fierce, member of the Die-Hards\nSir Archibald 'Archie' Roylance, English landowner\nQuentin Kennedy, childhood friend of Saskia, soldier and diplomat\nPhemie Morran, widow, owner of small cottage in Dalquaharter\nJames Loudon, corrupt factor for the Huntingtower estate.\nSaskia, fugitive princess, of one of the great families of Russia\nAlexis Nicolaevich ('Alexander Nicholson'), fianc\u00e9 to Saskia\nEug\u00e8nie, elderly cousin of Saskia\nPaul Abreskov, Bolshevik leader, much feared by Saskia.\nThe book was written only a few years after the Russian Revolution when there was considerable concern that Bolshevism might spread. Buchan mixes light fairytale elements (he called the book \"a Glasgow fairytale\") with a darker plot in which Bolshevik elements have penetrated every level of British society. Although the normal forces of law and order are powerless, revolution in Britain is averted by the down-to-earth, middle class views of McCunn, the grocer. As one Russian character says of him, admiringly, \"he is the stuff which above all others makes a great people. He will endure when aristocracies crack"

Ronald Beard, a screenwriter specialising in musicals, is grieving the death of his wife, Leonora, from cirrhosis of the liver. He is convinced by a Hollywood mogul to write a musical based on the life of Lord Byron, and Percy and Mary Shelley, so he makes the trip to Los Angeles to meet with the studio. There, he meets the photographer Paola Lucrezia Belli at a party and begins an affair, later following her to Rome.\nIn Rome, Beard gets down to work as Paola is called to Israel to take pictures of the Six Day War. While she is away, Beard is constantly interrupted by Gregory Gregson, a brash drunk who worked with Beard in the Colonial Service in Brunei, and mysterious phone calls from someone claiming to be Leonora. He also has to fend off Paola's ex-husband, the literary novelist Pathan, who lays claim to the contents of Paola's apartment.\nEventually, Beard, suffering from an unnamed, and terminal, tropical disease, settles down with Leonora's sister in England. He returns to Rome a final time to die, though his body refuses to give up.\n\nBeard's Roman Women is loosely based on Burgess's own experiences following the death of his first wife, Lynne, and his subsequent meeting with his second wife, Liana. The film script for the musical about Byron and Shelley is inspired by a television script Burgess wrote for BBC Two in 1964 titled 'By the Waters of Leman: Byron and Shelley at Geneva'. In reality, Burgess was commissioned to write a musical based on the life of Shakespeare by producer William Conrad.\nBeard's Roman Women was originally titled Rome in the Rain. It was changed by the American publisher, McGraw-Hill. It is still called Rome in the Rain in many translations.\nThe plot of the novel is loosely based on the Orpheus myth, including elements of Jean Cocteau's version Orphee.\nRonald Beard\nPaola Lucrezia Belli \u2013 an Italian photographer\nGreg Gregson \u2013 old Friend of Ronald Beard\nLeonora Beard \u2013 deceased wife of Ronald Beard\nP.R.

Gil Blas (French: L'Histoire de Gil Blas de Santillane [listwa\u0281 d\u0259 \u0292il bl\u0251 d\u0259 s\u0251\u0303tijan]) is a picaresque novel by Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage published between 1715 and 1735. It was translated into English by Tobias Smollett.\nGil Blas is related to Lesage's play Turcaret (1709). In both works, Lesage uses witty valets in the service of thieving masters, women of questionable morals, cuckolded yet happy husbands, gourmands, ridiculous poets, false savants, and dangerously ignorant doctors to make his point.  Each class and each occupation becomes an archetype.\nThis work is both universal and French within a Spanish context. However, its originality was questioned. Voltaire was among the first to point out similarities between Gil Blas and Marcos de Obreg\u00f3n by Vicente Espinel, from which Lesage had borrowed several details. Considering Gil Blas to be essentially Spanish, Jos\u00e9 Francisco de Isla claimed to translate the work from French into Spanish in order to return it to its natural state. Juan Antonio Llorente suggested that Gil Blas was written by the historian Antonio de Sol\u00eds y Ribadeneyra by arguing that no contemporary writer could have possibly written a work of such detail and accuracy.\nGil Blas is mentioned in Jean-Paul Sartre's novel Nausea. The central character is showing the Autodidact some photos. One of them is of Santillana. The Autodidact responds by asking \"the Santillana of Gil Blas?\"\nGil Blas is referred to by Jonathan Swift in his satirical Directions to Servants, dated 1731, with recommendations for the servants of rich masters to take the most advantage and have the least trouble in their daily tasks. In the chapter aimed at the \"House Steward and Land Steward\", Swift specifically instructs the reader to look up what Gil Blas has to say on the matter, as a more qualified source thus acknowledged.\nThe 1751 play Gil Blas by the British writer Edward Moore was performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane with David Garrick in the title role.\nVasily Narezhny imitated Lesage in his 1814 novel A Russian Gil Blas (Russian: \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0416\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0437).\nGil Blas is alluded to in Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's Venus in Furs. The character Wanda von Dunajew ascribes the cause of her own free thinking to an early introduction to classical works; these include  Gil Blas, which she read at the age of ten.\n\"Gil Blas\" is referred to in Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's Facino Cane. The protagonist promises to spare the narrator \"tales of adventures worthy of Gil Blas\".\nIn Oliver Wendell Holmes's The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table (1857), the Autocrat begins Section IX with the famous quote from Lesage's Preface: \"Aqui esta encerrada el alma del licenciado Pedro Garcia\": \"Here is enclosed the soul of the lawyer Pedro Garcia\". This signals that his own readers, like the two bachelors of Salamanca who discover Garcia's gravestone, will need to \"fix on the moral concealed\" beneath the surface of his recollections if they are to receive any benefit from them.\nIn a letter to William Dean Howells (July 5, 1875), Mark Twain tells of just completing the manuscript for The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (written in the third person) and deciding against taking Tom into adulthood: to do so, he says, \"would be fatal ... in any shape but autobiographically \u2013 like Gil Blas\". Scholar Walter Blair in Mark Twain and Huck Finn (1960) thus concludes that Twain's new novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which, picaresque-like, \"would run its protagonist 'through life', had to be written in the first person; Gil Blas was the model\".\nIn his plan for the novel The Life of a Great Sinner, Dostoyevsky notes that the concision of this work will at times mirror that of Gil Blas. Gil Blas is also mentioned in Chapter III of Dostoyevsky's A Gentle Creature, in which the narrator asks, \"Why, didn't she tell me that amusing story about Gil Blas and the Archbishop of Granada herself the day before yesterday? We were discussing books. She was telling me about the books she had been reading that winter, and it was then that she told me about the scene from Gil Blas.\"\nIn A Rogue's Life by Wilkie Collins the rogue declares, \"I am as even-tempered a rogue as you have met with anywhere since the days of Gil Blas.\"\nEdgar Allan Poe considered it among \"the finest narratives in the world\". Also he mentions the archbishop in Gil Blas in the short story \"The Angel of the Odd\": the angel makes a low bow and departs, wishing, in the language of the archbishop, \"beaucoup de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens.\"\nItalo Calvino's main character in The Baron in the Trees reads the book and lends it to a brigand.\nGil Blas is mentioned in Thomas Flanagan's 1979 novel The Year of the French, in which poet Owen MacCarthy mentions having it with him \"on"

Anne McCaffrey created Pern in the novella Weyr Search (1967) when her second child Todd was eleven. In 2001 and 2002 she published her fifteenth Pern novel and second collection of short stories. Dragon's Kin was their first collaborative work.\nTodd later recalled that a Del Rey editor in the 1990s \"pitched it to me that someone ought to continue Mum\u2019s legacy when she was no longer able. At the time I had misgivings and no story ideas.\"\nPreviously, as Todd Johnson, he had contributed the chapter \"Training and Fighting Dragons\" to The Dragonlover's Guide to Pern (1989). Mother and son had also discussed Pern and its setting for years, and she had suggested that he \"write the military science fiction prequels\" to the colonization, but that never progressed far.\nThey co-authored four Pern novels and, as of December 2011, Todd has done three alone. All are set just before and during the \"Third Pass\", about 500 years after human settlement on Pern and 2000 years before the \"Ninth Pass\" events chronicled in most of Anne McCaffrey's Pern books.\nThe story tells how the people of the fictional planet Pern discover the special abilities of the watch-whers or whers, a distant relative of the dragons. Subsequently, these beasts are used in mines to warn miners of gas pockets and also to locate stranded miners, should there be a cave-in.\nThe story begins some years before the 3rd Pass in Camp Natalon, a mining camp. There, the reader is introduced to a young boy Kindan, whose father owns a watch-wher called Dask. During a mining cave-in, Kindan loses his entire family as well as Dask, and is adopted by the Master Harper Zist, who begins to train him to be both an entertainer and a spy, something that Harpers do. This is how Kindan learns that the camp is divided into two parties, Natalon's and his uncle Tarik's.\nMeanwhile, the camp is without a watch-wher and minor accidents keep delaying the work. Despite the protests from Tarik and his group, Natalon decides to trade an entire winter's worth of coal for a chance for Kindan to ask a queen watch-wher for an egg. He succeeds and begins the difficult task of raising a nocturnal animal. As no records exist on how to raise or train the watch-wher, Kindan has no clue but is luckily aided by the mysterious Nuella. Together, they train Kisk and, in the process, learn a great deal about this species. This proves to be vital as, towards the end of the novel, Kisk's abilities will save many lives, including that of the camp leader, Natalon.\nDragon's Kin title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database lists cover artist Paul Youll for all US editions as of 2011-10-12, same for Les Edwards (UK), two ISBN.\nDragonriders of Pern series listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database.

It is left to the story-teller's wits to think of a plan to defeat Ming Shu, and reclaim his property.\nIn the second part, Kai Lung overhears a neighbor using an improper analogy, and decides to educate him by providing an example of a properly composed piece of prose.\nIn the third part, Kai Lung receives the distinction of being allowed to practise his craft before any official within three and a half li of his residence, provided that official is not engaged in important business at the time, and is authorized to style himself as \"Literary Instructor to the Shades of Female Ancestors\". He then finds a suitable occasion to launch into one of his narratives.\nUnrolling his mat is something Kai Lung does very often (usually under a mulberry tree), to tell his tales.\n\nKai Lung comes home one day to meet his wife, but finds everything in a state of disarray. An elderly neighbour tells him that the village has been devastated by Ming Shu. Kai Lung goes in the direction of Ming Shu. Along the way, he meets barbarians, a poor farmer named Thang, a bandless captain in the city of Chi-U, and finally (disguised as Mang-hi, a foreigner from the land of Kham) Ming Shu himself.\n\nA sage, finding sleep to be an unwelcome obstruction to his pursuit of enlightenment, cuts off his eyelids and throws them away. At the spot where his eyelids land grows a shrub whose leaves look like his eyelids. Later, during a famine, the shrub is rediscovered and used to make a potion that soon becomes famous enough to catch the attention of the emperor, who subsequently bestows great honors on Wan.\nA case of two people with the same fingerprints creates difficulties which are resolved by the mandarin Wong Tsoi.\nA ring of thieves realizes that its members don't need to take the trouble to steal to make a living, if they exact a tribute from everyone in the town in return for a promise not to give them any trouble.\nLin Ho, an ugly boy, is orphaned and sent to live with his rich uncle, who employs him as a slave. Lin Ho has been taught to do the best he can and not worry about the reaction to his actions, so he accepts this lot stoically. Then, one day, his uncle decides to get rid of him by sending him to make an offering at a shrine, giving him a lunch that contains a poisoned onion. At the foot of the hill containing the shrine, Lin Ho meets a proud warrior named Lam-Kwong, who, on the pretense that one cannot speak to the gods with onion breath, takes his onion, devours it greedily, and then dies\u2014but not before killing Lin Ho with a stone directed at his head. Lin Ho goes to heaven, but the beings there are not quite ready to receive him, and so, as a reward for the virtuous life he has led so far, he is allowed to re\u00ebnter his body. However, once he comes back to earth, he sees his own body lying beside that of Lam-Kwong, and decides that it would be much nicer to inhabit the forbidding body of a warrior than to resume his original post. This, however, poses a problem, for now he needs to work out what is expected of him\u2026\nThe apprentice to an ivory-carver, who works diligently but without much reward, wanders into the woods one day, and sees a tree, a pagoda, and a young woman, all of perfect proportion\u2026\nSome years later, Kai Lung tells a story to an unwilling listener, a suitor of one of his daughters.\nAt an early mythical period of imagined history, a young man redeems his word to cut a crescent off the moon, in order to win a young lady's hand.\nKai Lung is informed by his neighbors that he has received official honorable recognition, though he is displeased when he discovers it is for rumored skills he does not possess, rather than for his real accomplishments.\nThe last scion of a deposed dynasty overthrows a corrupt monarch and finds happiness, and a prophecy comes true, though not in the expected way.\nKai Lung, the main character.\nHwa-mei, his wife.\nMing Shu, the antagonist.\nMuch mention is made of Chinese mythology, such as a creation myth, as well as belief in various supernatural beings (most commonly referred to as \"demons\"), and the almost commonplace practice of magic and divination through"

The Dragon's Tooth is a 2011 fantasy novel written by N.D. Wilson. It is the first installment in the Ashtown Burials series and follows members of the Smith family, especially siblings Cyrus and Antigone who are new initiates in a secret society of explorers known as the Order of Brendan.\nThe author has stated that his intention was to write a young adult fantasy series whose sensibility and orientation were clearly American, in contrast to the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings fantasy series which are both anchored in an English milieu.  And though the novel has some aspects of the occult and supernatural, he also strived to base the series in the physical realm, where the characters are forced to rely on their physical and mental acuity, hoping to motivate readers to be enchanted by \"the wonder of here and the wonder of now.\"\nThe book is full of cultural, historical, and mythological references, such as the dragon's tooth of the title which is a reference to the Dragon's teeth of Greek mythology used by Jason in his quest for the Golden Fleece. Meanwhile, the antagonist of the novel, known as \"Phoenix,\" references such classic villains as Dr. Moreau and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\nTransmortals are a group of beings appearing in the series. A transmortal is simply an ordinary mortal who somehow becomes immortal. Thus they have transformed from mortal, to immortal. There is no common way to become a transmortal. Some have eaten of the Fruit of Life, or drank of the Fountain of Youth. Others become undying by possessing a powerful object, such as the Odyssian Cloak or Dragon's Tooth. It is also a result of some blessing or curse.\nWilson commonly chooses semi-famous people from history and mythology to give this transmortality to. In the first book of the Ashtown Burials, The Dragon's Tooth, Maximilian Robespierre, the leader of the French Revolution, is revealed to be a transmortal. In later books, legendary people like Gilgamesh of Uruk, Arachne, and Captain John Smith are introduced, all being known in the real world, and given transmortality by Wilson. These characters are given a mystical touch possibly derived from the uncertainty of the nature of the historical figures themselves. \nA common trait among transmortals is grief, which often leads to violence. In truth, the transmortals are tired of living forever. The Order of Brendan will bury the most dangerous of the transmortals, while making power-limiting treaties with others. Many transmortals desire the burials, where they can endure life in sleep. There are few ways to kill transmortals, the Dragon's Tooth being the most famous. Many weapons were made with the charm of the tooth, and can cause pain when used on transmortals, but do not kill unless the Tooth itself is present. Several times, when Cyrus Smith has the Dragon's Tooth, his allied transmortals will plead for him to end their misery.\nCritical reception to the novel was positive. Publishers Weekly, in a \"starred review,\" referred to the book's \"measured prose and smart dialogue.\" Kirkus Book Reviews noted that the book's \"somewhat bombastic prose\" was balanced by the heroes' \"winsome charm.\"\nThe Drowned Vault\nEmpire of Bones\nInterview with NPR, November 10, 2011, https://www.npr.org/2011/11/10/142207375/epic-fantasy-meets-americana-in-the-dragons-tooth (accessed 14 January 2012).\nPublisher's Weekly, August 2011, http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-375-86439-1 (accessed 14 January 2012).\nKirkus Book Reviews, July 1, 2011, http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/nd-wilson/dragons-tooth/#review (accessed 14 January 2012)."

It is primarily set in New York City, United States.\nAfter many popular mystery novels and a number of movies, the character of Ellery Queen was at this point firmly established.  This novel in the Ellery Queen canon was perhaps influenced by the Ellery Queen radio show and films that were popular at the time; Beau Rummell is never seen again in the canon, and Ellery Queen never opens another detective agency in the books (although he maintains an office in more than one film).  \"Ellery directs his partner in a vague investigation of a recluse millionaire's death at sea.

Isabel and her younger sister, Ruth, were supposed to be released from slavery as promised by the will of their owner, Miss Mary Finch, when she died. Unfortunately, they landed in the hands of Miss Mary's nephew, Robert Finch, who claimed them as his property with the reason that there was no actual will in physical form. He then sold them to a Loyalist couple who brings them to New York away from their previous hometown, Newport, Rhode Island. Isabel, determined to gain her and her sister's liberty, follows the advice of a servant boy named Curzon, who tells her to spy on her master and other Loyalists for any suspicious plans that could be reported back to the Patriots to use against the Loyalists.\n\nThe protagonist and narrator of the novel, she is always striving her best to do anything she can do to get her and her sister out of slavery and back to Rhode Island, where they belong. Though at a very young age\u2014thirteen years old\u2014she has a very tough character and is devoted to anything she does. Her cleverness helps her in her various tasks on spying the Loyalists and planning her escape. She is very nurturing towards her younger sister Ruth, knowing that she is the only person who can truly take care of her. She befriends a slave boy named Curzon who works for a Patriot, to whom she is a good friend he can always trust, which is shown when she desperately tried to deliver leftover food to Curzon, who is in prison; considering she knows the consequences of helping a Patriot when she herself is working for a Loyalist. She also shows a brave spirit when she stands up to Mrs. Lockton and demand the information on the whereabouts of Ruth, who Lockton said she has sold but in truth kept Ruth in hiding away from Isabel to weaken her. This action results in her being branded with I for insolence on her right cheek as a punishment for standing up to her master, but towards the end of the novel she sees this mark standing for her name Isabel, and is proud to have everyone know her name. On the night of the Queens Ball she makes her move on her way to freedom, bringing Curzon along with her.\nIsabel's five-year-old sister and also a slave. Ruth, who is suffering from epilepsy, often encounters fits from this sickness. She does not talk very often and does what she is told without question, which becomes the more desirable slave to Mrs. Lockton and she would be kept in Mrs. Lockton's chamber for hours to be her personal maid. As a young child, she is sometimes stubborn, for example she asks for her baby doll every night before going to bed even though she knows that Mr. Robert Finch has taken away all their belongings. Her innocent and vulnerable nature makes her very dependent on Isabel.\nThe Locktons are the owners of Isabel and her sister Ruth throughout, pretty much the whole book. They are both loyalists and try their hardest to make the little girls' lives miserable.\nA Loyalist who is very self-centered and devious. His commitment to being a Loyalist is shown by his various attempts to get the rebels to join the British side; one of the attempts was to bribe them and hiding the money in his wife's linen chest to discourage suspicion. This attempt, however, was discovered thanks to Isabel's report on her spying tasks. He also had a plan to assassinate President George Washington along with a group of Loyalists; unfortunately, their plan was also discovered by Isabel. At home, he is very abusive towards his wife, and he demands to be obeyed by everybody in the house. And he has a big belly according to the Narrator.\nThe main antagonist of Chains (and arguably the entire trilogy) and the wife of Elihu Lockton, she is also a Loyalist, though not as strongly committed as her husband. Very abusive towards Isabel, both physically and mentally, she does not call her by name and instead calls her Sal; in return demanding Isabel refers to her as Madam. Her harsh and brutal character is shown in her branding Isabel as a punishment for standing up to her and running away afterward. She strongly dislikes Isabel, as opposed to her liking Ruth because she is considered easier to order around. She is very impatient and she always blames Isabel for accidents she encounters, also often picking on the simplest mistakes such as not placing her dog statue in the right position after being dusted. When her husband's aunt falls sick, she hopes that her condition will cause her to die soon. Whenever Lady Seymour's condition improves, Mrs. Lockton seems to be saddened..\nThe previous owner of Isabel and"

The Swede is drunk and erratic and tells Bernard that on the night of Tessa's death he was hired to fly Jay Prettyman from Berlin to London and was carrying a locked box that Prettyman would need.

The Department ordered Dicky to bring Tessa to Berlin. Silas blackmailed Prettyman into hiring Thurkettle to kill Tessa and then killing him. The box was a bomb designed to blow up The Swede's plane removing the last loose ends. Bernard suspected this but said nothing hoping to flush out who else was in on the plan but is forced to step in when he discovers Bret has ordered Frank's assistant to break into the box.\nBret tells Bernard that both he and the Department owe him and that he will do his best to try to give Frank's job, and a pension to Bernard when Frank retires. Bret tells Bernard he is being stupid and that Fiona really loves him and not her job. Bernard say he has asked Fiona to join him in Berlin and hopes that his children can go to school in Berlin just like he did.\n\"Charity: A New Bernard Samson Novel\". publishersweekly.com.

Chalice is a fantasy novel by American writer Robin McKinley.  It was published in 2008 by G. P. Putnam's Sons.\nAlthough McKinley does not explain the situation in detail, the book indicates that the country is divided into demesnes, each one with a Master, and that Master's Circle (The Master is part of the Circle). There is an Overlord over all of the demesnes. The Circle's task is to maintain the stability of the land, including the housing and health of the human and non-human inhabitants, and of the land itself. They do this by tending to the earthlines, apparently zones of importance in maintaining order. If the earthlines are disturbed, or not maintained, there may be disease, fire, deterioration of buildings and fences, and sickness of humans and animals. Each Circle has twelve members, each with a title, Chalice and Master being two of those titles. Chalices seem to always be female. Some of the officers of the Circle where the action in Chalice takes place are male, some female. Circle members usually have apprentices. Replacement of Circle members, often by their apprentices, is by divination, which seems to be supernaturally guided, and is usually carried out by the Prelate, a Circle member, who uses rods to select new members. The Grand Seneschal is another important member of the Circle. The Master has the most power, the Chalice next, and the Grand Seneschal is third in power and ability to take care of the land. The demesne where the story takes place is Willowlands.\nMastership is usually hereditary. In cases where that is not possible, and a new Master is brought in from another demesne, the Master and his demesne, and its people, may not achieve stability for generations.\nThere is an established religion, with three types of priests, those of Earth, Air and Fire, but no description of the practices of this religion.\nExcerpt on www.robinmckinley.com\nReview of Chalice in Christian Science Monitor."

The now-dead Master was concerned only with his own pleasure and power, and neglected his duties to his demesne. Seven years before the story begins, the Master sent his brother away, to join the priests of Fire. The brother had been concerned about the demesne, and opposed the Master's ways. When the older brother died, the Grand Seneschal sent for the younger brother, asking that he become the new Master. ...",

Chalice is a fantasy novel by American writer Robin McKinley.  It was published in 2008 by G. P. Putnam's Sons.\nAlthough McKinley does not explain the situation in detail, the book indicates that the country is divided into demesnes, each one with a Master, and that Master's Circle (The Master is part of the Circle). There is an Overlord over all of the demesnes. The Circle's task is to maintain the stability of the land, including the housing and health of the human and non-human inhabitants, and of the land itself. They do this by tending to the earthlines, apparently zones of importance in maintaining order. If the earthlines are disturbed, or not maintained, there may be disease, fire, deterioration of buildings and fences, and sickness of humans and animals. Each Circle has twelve members, each with a title, Chalice and Master being two of those titles. Chalices seem to always be female. Some of the officers of the Circle where the action in Chalice takes place are male, some female. Circle members usually have apprentices. Replacement of Circle members, often by their apprentices, is by divination, which seems to be supernaturally guided, and is usually carried out by the Prelate, a Circle member, who uses rods to select new members. The Grand Seneschal is another important member of the Circle. The Master has the most power, the Chalice next, and the Grand Seneschal is third in power and ability to take care of the land. The demesne where the story takes place is Willowlands.\nMastership is usually hereditary. In cases where that is not possible, and a new Master is brought in from another demesne, the Master and his demesne, and its people, may not achieve stability for generations.\nThere is an established religion, with three types of priests, those of Earth, Air and Fire, but no description of the practices of this religion.\nExcerpt on www.robinmckinley.com\nReview of Chalice in Christian Science Monitor."

Malice Aforethought (1931) is a crime novel written by Anthony Berkeley Cox, using the pen name Francis Iles. It is an early and prominent example of the \"inverted detective story\", claimed to have been invented by R. Austin Freeman some years earlier. The murderer's identity is revealed in the first line of the novel, which gives the reader insight into the workings of his mind as his plans progress. It also contains elements of black comedy, and of serious treatment of underlying tensions in a superficially respectable community. It is loosely based on the real-life case of Herbert Armstrong, with elements of Doctor Crippen.\nThe novel has been adapted for television twice.\nThe first was a four-part serial by the BBC in 1979, starring Hywel Bennett as Dr. Bickleigh, Cheryl Campbell as Madeleine, and Judy Parfitt as Julia. It later aired in 1981 when it was featured in the US PBS series, Mystery!, introduced by Vincent Price.\nA second adaptation Malice Aforethought, starring Ben Miller as Dr. Bickleigh, Megan Dodds as Madeleine, and Barbara Flynn as Julia, was produced by Granada Television and broadcast on ITV in 2005.  It too has been shown on Mystery! in 2005.\nViolet Powell The Life of a Provincial Lady p101\n\"Malice Aforethought\".

In the second edition, Goldstein corrected all the errors that had been pointed out, added a new chapter on perturbation theory, a new section on Bertrand's theorem, and another on Noether's theorem. Other arguments and proofs were simplified and supplemented.\nBefore the death of its primary author in 2005, a new (third) edition of the book was released, with the collaboration of Charles P. Poole and John L. Safko from the University of South Carolina. In the third edition, the book discusses at length various mathematically sophisticated reformations of Newtonian mechanics, namely analytical mechanics, as applied to particles, rigid bodies and continua. In addition, it covers in some detail classical electromagnetism, special relativity, and field theory, both classical and relativistic. There is an appendix on group theory. New to the third edition include a chapter on nonlinear dynamics and chaos, a section on the exact solutions to the three-body problem obtained by Euler and Lagrange, a discussion of the damped driven pendulum that explains the Josephson junctions. This is counterbalanced by the reduction of several existing chapters motivated by the desire to prevent this edition from exceeding the previous one in length. For example, the discussions of Hermitian and unitary matrices were omitted because they are more relevant to quantum mechanics rather than classical mechanics, while those of Routh's procedure and time-independent perturbation theory were reduced.\nPreface\nChapter 1: Survey of Elementary Principles\nChapter 2: Variational Principles and Lagrange's Equations\nChapter 3: The Central Force Problem\nChapter 4: The Kinematics of Rigid Body Motion\nChapter 5: The Rigid Body Equations of Motion\nChapter 6: Oscillations\nChapter 7: The Classical Mechanics of the Special Theory of Relativity\nChapter 8: The Hamilton Equations of Motion\nChapter 9: Canonical Transformations\nChapter 10: Hamilton\u2013Jacobi Theory and Action-Angle Coordinates\nChapter 11: Classical Chaos\nChapter 12: Canonical Perturbation Theory\nChapter 13: Introduction to the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Formulations for Continuous Systems and Fields\nAppendix A: Euler Angles in Alternate Conventions and Cayley\u2013Klein Parameters\nAppendix B: Groups and Algebras\nAppendix C: Solutions to Select Exercises\nSelect Bibliography\nAuthor Index\nSubject Index\nGoldstein, Herbert (1951).

Quimby of Columbia University noted that the first half of the first edition of the book is dedicated to the development of Lagrangian mechanics with the treatment of velocity-dependent potentials, which are important in electromagnetism, and the use of the Cayley-Klein parameters and matrix algebra for rigid-body dynamics. This is followed by a comprehensive and clear discussion of Hamiltonian mechanics. End-of-chapter references improve the value of the book. Quimby pointed out that although this book is suitable for students preparing for quantum mechanics, it is not helpful for those interested in analytical mechanics because its treatment omits too much. Quimby praised the quality of printing and binding which make the book attractive.\nIn the Journal of the Franklin Institute, Rupen Eskergian noted that the first edition of Classical Mechanics offers a mature take on the subject using vector and tensor notations and with a welcome emphasis on variational methods. This book begins with a review of elementary concepts, then introduces the principle of virtual work, constraints, generalized coordinates, and Lagrangian mechanics. Scattering is treated in the same chapter as central forces and the two-body problem. Unlike most other books on mechanics, this one elaborates upon the virial theorem. The discussion of canonical and contact transformations, the Hamilton-Jacobi theory, and action-angle coordinates is followed by a presentation of geometric optics and wave mechanics. Eskergian believed this book serves as a bridge to modern physics.\nWriting for The Mathematical Gazette on the first edition, L. Rosenhead congratulated Goldstein for a lucid account of classical mechanics leading to modern theoretical physics, which he believed would stand the test of time alongside acknowledged classics such as E.T. Whittaker's Analytical Dynamics and Arnold Sommerfeld's Lectures on Theoretical Physics. This book is"

After an unusually sheltered upbringing by their old-fashioned and snobbish aunt, 11-year-old Santa and her 12-year-old brother Peter are faced with the prospect of separate orphanages when she dies. They set out to find their unknown Uncle Gus, who travels with Cob's Circus. They are surprised to find out that he is a clown and a trapeze artist. Gus is taken aback by their sudden appearance and is inclined to send them to the orphanages after all, but he is persuaded to let them stay with the circus for the season. They are fascinated by the life and work hard to fit in, Peter being drawn to the horses and Santa taking up acrobatics. They learn the truth about their family's origins in domestic service, and while it is a shock at first, soon they are glad not to have to live up to their aunt's aristocratic pretensions. They hear many tales of circus life as they travel around the country. At the end of the season, Gus agrees that they have earned a chance to stay with the circus.\n\nSanta and Peter Possit\nSasha, Olga and Alexsis Petoff\nFifi Moulin\nHans and Fritzi Schmidt\nRev Stebbings, Peter's Latin tutor\nBill, a helpful Londoner\nAt the circus\nGus Possit, Auguste and trapezist\nTed Kenet, Clown and trapezist\nBen Willis, Master of the Horse (stablemaster)\nMr Cob, Ringmaster and owner of the circus\nThe Petoffs (Liberty horses)\nThe Moulins (Performing poodles)\nThe Schmidts (Sea lions)\nKundra (Elephants)\nSatan (Lions)\nThe illustrator Steven Spurrier accompanied Noel Streatfeild in quest of material for the book, travelling with Bertram Mills' Circus. Before the drawings were finalised, Spurrier fell ill, and the book was issued with reproductions of the original sketches, \"full of swift and lively observation\". The first American edition (1939) was illustrated by Richard Floethe in a striking but more conventional style. Another notable illustrator was Clarke Hutton whose illustrations for the 1947 edition also appeared in the 1956 Puffin Books edition.\nJohn Rowe Townsend describes The Circus Is Coming as Noel Streatfeild's best-known and possibly her best pre-war book. Townsend commends the detailed personal research which gives the book so much authenticity and compares it with Streatfeild's perceptive writing on family, suggesting that the circus is a \"super-family\". Roger Lancelyn Green mentions the novelistic skill and meticulous accuracy typical of Streatfeild's exceptional career books.\nIn her biography of the author, Angela Bull notes that while \"most reviewers praised it warmly\", the Time and Tide reviewer thoroughly disliked Peter and Santa, wishing that Noel had \"killed them off, instead of trailing them through the book and nearly spoiling her excellent material\".\nNoel Streatfeild received the Carnegie Medal for The Circus Is Coming in the award's third year. Her Ballet Shoes had been considered for the medal in the first year, as had Howard Spring's Sampson's Circus. The Circus Is Coming combines the circus setting of Spring's adventure story (which also had illustrations by Spurrier) with the artiste training of Ballet Shoes. It also has main characters of both sexes, like the winner of that first year's medal, Pigeon Post.\nCarnegie Archive\nThe Circus Is Coming at Fantastic Fiction\nCircus Shoes at WorldCat\n1947 edition at WorldCat\nJohn Rowe Townsend, Written for Children: An Outline of English-language Children's Literature, third revised edition, Penguin Books, 1987, p. 165\nRoger Lancelyn Green, Tellers of Tales, revised edition, Edmund Ward, 1965, pp. 263\u2013264\nAngela Bull, Noel Streatfeild, William Collins, Sons 1984, pp. 152\u2013153\nThe Circus Is Coming at the White Gauntlet Noel Streatfeild site"

P. Dutton (US). Thirteen-year-old Theodore lives in a remote region of China at his father's mission. When the violence of the Boxer Rebellion finally reaches them, Theodore escapes alone from its destruction. He soon becomes one companion of a formidable Englishwoman, \"painted, blasphemous, gun-toting Mrs Jones\". She is an amateur botanist and a former actress with an entourage.\nThe party flees bandits into Tibet and take refuge at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery. Theodore is briefly seen to be the Tulku, a great lama reincarnated; then the recently conceived child of Mrs Jones and her Chinese lover is identified as the one. Theodore is exposed to the \"magnetic, repugnant rituals of Buddhism\" and develops as a \"whole, willing Christian\". Mrs Jones is recruited to remain on site and the boy finally returns to England with the fruit of her botanical expedition.\nThe themes of Tulku are the intertwining of religion and politics, the nature of personal belief, and how far belief can coexist with cynicism. Thus it is similar to Dickinson's earlier novel The Blue Hawk (Gollancz, 1977), for which he won the once-in-a-lifetime Guardian Children's Fiction Prize.\nTibetan Buddhism\n\"Tulku\" (first U.S. edition).

In the land of the Dells, there are \"monsters.\" Impossibly beautiful animals of unnatural colors, that can entrance people with their appearance and control them with their minds. Lady Fire is the last human monster in existence. Her father, Lord Cansrel, used his powers to manipulate the former king, Nax, and throw the Dells into a chaotic, lawless state. With both Nax and Cansrel now dead, the new king Nash and his brother Brigan hope to return the Dells to order and stop a civil war. \nAs she's passing through the woods one day, a poacher shoots Fire. She's startled by how confusing and empty his mind is, and uses her powers to make him take her back home. Fire's friend and lover, Archer, locks him up, planning to have Fire use her powers for an interrogation once she's had some time to heal, but the next morning they find that the poacher has been shot dead by an arrow at long-range.\nFire and Archer go to Queen Roen's castle to request more guards for their estate and see if they can find information about the mysterious strangers that keep appearing in their woods. While there, Fire meets Nash and Brigan for the first time. Nash is blinded by her monster beauty and instantly falls in love with her, while Brigan distrusts her, believing she's another Cansrel. As the king, prince, and their soldiers are going to defend a village that's being raided, a group of monster raptors attacks them. Fire risks her life by distracting the birds, as they desire her monster flesh more than that of normal humans. She is praised as a hero for her courage, and many of the soldiers consider themselves in her debt.\nWhen she returns home, Brigan calls upon her, saying Nash has requested she come to the capital and use her powers to interrogate prisoners for useful information. While on the journey, Fire has to be guarded constantly by an elite group of soldiers, as many men are driven into a rage by her beauty and try to attack her. She realizes she and Brigan have a lot in common and the two come to an odd understanding.\nAt King's City, Fire meets Clara and Garan, Nax's illegitimate twins and the royal spymasters, who convince her to use her powers for the good of the kingdom. She agrees, on the condition she will not force information out of anyone, merely persuade them to give it freely. Nash still struggles to control his lust towards her and asks her to marry him on a daily basis. Fire is also shocked to learn that Brigan has a young daughter, Hanna.\nArcher arrives at the capital and becomes jealous of Brigan, forcing Fire to break off their arrangement for the sake of their friendship. Archer begins sleeping with women all over the palace, resulting in Clara and Mila, one of Fire's guards, falling pregnant. Fire realizes that she's jealous of her friends having children, but has already decided the world is too dangerous for human monsters to live in and human monsters are too dangerous for the world. Afraid she might change her mind, she takes a herb Clara told her about that'll make her infertile.\nThe strange men with empty minds continue to appear around Fire. One day she notices a boy with mismatched eyes (one grey, the other red) torturing a mouse for fun. When she tells him to stop, he insists he isn't hurting it, expecting her to be fooled by his words. He is delighted when she's not. Fire realizes the minds of the people he speaks to have the same empty feeling as the men who came onto her land, but by this time the boy is already gone.\nThe royals have a plan to assassinate their enemies at the upcoming winter gala, using Fire and her powers to make sure it goes off without a hitch. Archer is against the idea, and in his anger blurts out Fire's biggest secret: she killed Cansrel. Realizing he needed to be stopped, she used her mind powers to lure him down to where he kept his monster pets, made him open the cage, and watched as he was ripped to shreds. Cansrel had become so unstable by that point that people had no trouble believing it was suicide.\nArcher confesses he needs to escape and time to think, so he goes in search of a young boy that has bothered Fire immensely. With his red eye, casual cruelty, and a voice that hurts her but entrances everyone else, she links him to the strange and thoughtless men that have been bothering her and the royal family with increased frequency. No one gives her much heed except Archer, who sees it as his responsibility after he wronged Fire. He leaves with her forgiveness and"

On the night of August 14\u201315, 1945, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, a battalion of rogue Imperial Japanese Army officers and troops led by Major Kenji Hatanaka seize the Imperial Palace to prevent the surrender of Japan. They persuade the war minister, General Korechika Anami, to join the coup and gain the support from the rest of the Japanese military. Rather than staying loyal to Emperor Hirohito, as in actual history, Anami orders the imprisonment of Hirohito and establishes himself as the de facto dictator of Imperial Japan. \nAnami's refusal to surrender cause US President Harry Truman to order Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall to launch Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of Japan. In preparation for the invasion, a third atomic bomb is dropped on Kokura, destroying the city. Anami authorizes the transfer of Allied POWs to cities of strategic importance, which prompts the United States to suspend the atomic bombing campaign.  The OSS recruit the Japanese American veteran Joe Nomura to head into Nagasaki under the guise of a Japanese officer to investigate the effects of the nuclear blast. Based on in part of his reports of the radiation effects, the US military's intention of using the atomic bombs tactically is abandoned as too dangerous for their own troops.\nIn Okinawa, General Douglas MacArthur begins the first phase of Operation Downfall, the invasion of Kyushu (codenamed Olympic), followed by an invasion of Honshu (codenamed Coronet) with the ultimate goal of capturing Tokyo. They are initially set back by the typhoon season, however Allied forces land on Kyushu on X-Day, suffering heavy losses from Japanese guerilla warfare, kamikaze attacks, Kairyu submarines, and Kaiten human torpedoes.\nAs Allied forces gain a foothold in Kyushu, Nomura aids an American POW, Dennis Chambers, who escaped in the confusion from a Japanese POW camp that was close to Nagasaki. With his aid, Nomura impersonates a Kenpeitai officer and investigates a heavily guarded camp in Nagasaki, unaware that it houses Hirohito.\nMacArthur is killed on the command vessel USS Augusta by a kamikaze attack. General Omar Bradley becomes commander of the operation with Matthew Ridgway as his immediate subordinate while a fourth atomic bomb is ordered by General Curtis LeMay on a loose interpretation of standing orders from President Truman to be dropped on the Kanmon Straits, destroying several Japanese divisions. Back in the homefront, civil disorder occurs in the US in reaction to the news of the sinking of RMS Queen Elizabeth. Meanwhile, the Red Army invades and occupies Japanese Korea in order to aid the Chinese Communist Party against the Kuomintang during the Chinese Civil War.\nNomura learns that Hirohito is held captive in Nagasaki, and when his superiors are made aware, Bradley authorizes an operation to rescue Hirohito. Nomura, Chambers, and a squad of US Army Rangers extract Hirohito, escape Japan, and bring him to an aircraft carrier in which he meets Truman. Aware of Hirohito's declaration to surrender to the Allies, a countercoup, led by General Homma and Admiral Ozawa, assassinates Anami and accepts the surrender of Japan in January 1946, despite failing to prevent a successful Japanese counterattack against Allied positions in Kyushu.\nIn the aftermath, the Allied invasion of Japan costed an additional 150,000 Allied casualties. Hirohito is reinstated as Japan's emperor and Japan's transition to democracy begins. Despite the Kuomintang's defeat and retreat to Taiwan, the Communist Chinese and Soviets fail to secure a \nSino-Soviet alliance. The Soviet Union is forced to abandon the Korean Peninsula by the Korean independence movement, which likely leads to a Korean unification and the prevention of a Korean War.\nWith the Soviet economy damaged from the previous war with Nazi Germany and their sphere of influence driven out of East Asia, the Americans look toward a better future, as the ensuing Cold War between the US and Soviet Union will most likely be peaceful.\nBooklist said that \"realistic to the point of gruesomeness, 1945 recalls David Westheimer's classic Death is Lighter than a Feather.\"  Publishers Weekly said that Conroy explored the carnage of war through various viewpoints with \"moving and thought provoking results\".\n\"Fantastic Fiction.com: 1945 by Robert Conroy\". www.fantasticfiction.com.\n1945 title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\n\"Uchronia: 1945\". www.uchronia.net.\nGreen, Roland (May 1, 2007). \"1945\".

At the start of the novel, the United States, having defeated the Empire of Japan, is in no mood to enter a new war, and Americans accept the fait accompli of German domination over most of Europe. A cold war seems in the offing, and even the British, with a German-dominated Europe at its doorstep, squander much of their resources on a colonial war in the former French Indochina.\nUS President Andrew Harrison (a fictional character) has a summit with Adolf Hitler at Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland. The meeting goes badly, both leaders sharply confront each other, and Hitler secretly decides to accelerate preparations for a surprise attack on both the United States and the United Kingdom. As part of the preparations, a beautiful German spy seduces and suborns the White House Chief of Staff and makes him a key German spy.\nThe book's protagonist, Lieutenant Commander James Martel, at the incipient Head of Naval Intelligence at the American embassy in Berlin, is one of the few who suspects the gathering storm by watching the new weapons displayed at the parade commemorating Germany's victory over the Soviet Union and encountering the well-known commando Otto Skorzeny, who is his main opponent throughout the book.\nSkorzeny makes meticulous secret preparations for raids to destroy the American atomic bomb programs in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory. (During the book's war with Japan, the Manhattan Project was put on the back burner, making the 1945 United States far from already possessing a nuclear bomb.) The bulk of the book is devoted to Martel, back in the United States, getting a glimmering of the threatened attack and unsuccessfully trying to sound a warning.\nThe German raid takes place, and though the Germans are eventually beaten back, the raid causes great damage by killing key scientists and setting the American nuclear program behind Germany's. The Germans also seize the uranium mines in the Congo region while they launch all-out war against the United Kingdom.\nThe book ends with a cliffhanger. Erwin Rommel invades Scotland, the British face a desperate fight, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill imploring the Americans to \"come quickly, this is much worse than 1940.\"\nThe novel originally didn't end on a cliffhanger, but was in fact a single novel that was split into two parts by the publisher. The promised sequel, provisionally called Fortress Europa, has yet to be written though many years have passed, and the writers have meanwhile completed a different alternate history trilogy (beginning with Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War).\nIn reality, \"Fortress Europe\" was the Nazi concept of making German-occupied Europe impregnable to the invasion, which was clearly coming since the Allies started massing their forces in Britain in 1943. In D-Day, the \"fortress\" was decisively breached. Presumably, the sequel to 1945 would feature something similar later in the 1940s.\nAxis victory in World War II\n\"Uchronia: 1945\". www.uchronia.net.\n\"Fantastic Fiction.com 1945\"."

Al-Farahidi introduces the dictionary with an outline of the phonetics of Arabic. The format he adopted for the dictionary consisted of twenty-six books, a book for every letter, with weak letters combined as a single book; the number of chapters of each book accords with the number of radicals, with the weak radicals being listed last. According to this system roots are treated anagrammatically, and all possible anagrams of radical arrangements given.  The introduction to volume I contains the phonotactic rules of the Arabic root system, where consonants are classified according to properties of vocalisation, point of articulation, and common distributional characteristics. The intention is not the production of a complete lexicon of the Arabic language, but rather a lexicon of the root system from which expands the vast, almost limitless, vocabulary of the Arabic language.\nAl-Farahidi groups consonants according to their vocalisation characteristics:\nFrom the throat: Ayn, H\u0101\u02be, Kh\u0101\u02be, \u1e24\u0101\u02be, Ghayn\nFrom the soft palate: K\u0101f, Q\u0101f\nFrom the palate: \u1e62\u0101d, \u1e0c\u0101d, J\u012bm\nFrom the teeth and tip of the tongue: Sh\u012bn, S\u012bn, Z\u0101y\nFrom the prepalate: \u1e6c\u0101\u02be, T\u0101\u02be, D\u0101l\nFrom the gums: \u1e92\u0101\u02be, Th\u0101\u02be, \u1e0e\u0101l\nFrom the apex of the tongue: L\u0101m, N\u016bn, R\u0101\u02be\nFrom the lips: F\u0101\u02be, B\u0101\u02be, M\u012bm\nFrom the palate with the emission of air: Y\u0101\u02be, W\u0101w, \u02beAlif, Hamzah\nAl-Farahidi's manuscript, originally held in a library of the Tahirid dynasty, was returned to Basra in 862, or 863CE, seventy years after his death, when a northeast Persian bookseller sold it for fifty dinars. Some few copies were made available for commercial sale, although the work remained rare through much of the Middle Ages and despite being in circulation in Al-Andalus in 914/915CE,  it was not until its discovery by Lebanese-Iraqi monk Anastas Al-Karmali in 1914 that it was reintroduced into the West. In the modern era, the book has been printed by Maktabah Al Hilal, having been reviewed by Dr. Mahdi al Makhz\u016bmi and Dr. Ibr\u0101him Al Samir\u0101'\u00ec in eight volumes. The dictionary (alphabetically arranged) is available in Arabic in a four volume edition published in 2003 by Dar al-Kitab al-'Alamiyya (\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629) and available online.\nAll subsequent lexicographic works in Arabic are based on al-Farahidi's dictionary, and it is said that al-Farahidi's Kitab al-Ayn did for lexicography what his student Sibawayh's al-Kitab (\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628) did for grammar. Historically, a handful of rival Arab lexicographers questioned the attribution of the book to al-Farahidi, though modern scholarship has attributed this to jealousy in the part of later linguists who have found themselves in al-Farahidi's shadow. The work caused later controversy as well. Ibn Duraid, who wrote the second comprehensive Arabic dictionary ever, was accused by his contemporary Niftawayh of simply plagiarizing al-Farahidi's work.\nAl-Farahidi tried to rationalize the empirical practice of lexicography in al-Ayn, explicitly referring to the calculation of arrangements and combinations in order to exhaustively enumerate all words in Arabic. According to al-Farahidi's theory, what is known as the Arabic language is merely the phonetically realized part of the entire possible language. The various combinations of roots are reckoned by al-Farahidi by the arrangement r to r with 1 < r \u2264 5, which is the possible language; the possible language, however, is limited by the rules of phonological compatibility among the phonemes of the roots. By applying this limit to the possible language, al-Farahidi theorized that the actual language could be extracted and thus the lexis of Arabic could be recorded.\nAl-Farahidi began his extraction of the actual language from the possible language based on the phonological limit by calculating the nonrepetitive number of combinations of Arabic roots, taken as r to r with r = 2 - 5. He then took that along with the number of permutations for each r group; he finally calculated A\u02b3\u2099 = r! (\u207f\u1d63) with n being the number of letters in the Semitic alphabet. Al-Farahidi's theory and calculation are now found in the writings of most lexicographers.\nSearchable online version\nIntroduction to Arabesques: Selections of Biography and Poetry from Classical Arabic Literature, pg. 13.

In this book Seife concentrates on the information theory, discussing various issues, such as decoherence and probability, relativity and quantum mechanics, works of Turing and Schr\u00f6dinger, entropy and superposition, etc.\nThe cosmos, as Seife depicts it, is a great big information swap meet. Objects enormous and minuscule are always encountering other objects and being affected by them in such a way that they \u201cgather information\u201d \u2014 not consciously, of course, but in the way that the mercury collected information about my boiling syrup. A pool ball that\u2019s hit by another pool ball receives information about the speed and direction of the ball that hit it. Subatomic particles do the same. Of course, subatomic particles do a lot of things that are much more baffling than this, like existing in two different places at the same time until someone or something tries to locate them. But, as Seife argues, information still lies at the root of all this. \u201cDecoding the Universe\u201d offers a history of the development of information theory, too, beginning with the cryptographers of World War II.\n\u2014Salon\nLeon Brillouin, Science and Information Theory, Mineola, N.Y.: Dover, [1956, 1962] 2004.

The book has been positively reviewed as accessible and highly involving, and appealing to a wide age of readers, as well as being a suspenseful, absorbing read. On the other hand, the novel has been criticised for having \"not nearly enough of the ineffable spirit of a truly haunting ghost story\". The novel won the Young Adult Book Award in 2002.

Apollo 13 was the third mission of the Apollo program intended to land men on the Moon. An explosion of an onboard liquid oxygen tank in the Service Module, when the craft was close to reaching the Moon, crippled the electrical power generation and propulsion systems for the Command Module Odyssey. This necessitated the abort of the lunar landing, and placed the lives of astronauts Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise in serious jeopardy. The mission became famous for the safe return of the men, made possible by the flight controllers' resourceful adaptation of the electrical, propulsion, and life support systems of the LM (Lunar Module) Aquarius as a \"lifeboat\".\nHardcover, 378 pages\nPublisher: Houghton Mifflin (T) (October 1994)\nLanguage: English\nISBN\u00a00-395-67029-2\nDimensions: 1.5 \u00d7 6.2 \u00d7 9.2\u00a0inches\nThe Right Stuff (1979 book) by Tom Wolfe, about the U.S. side of the Space Race\nDunn, Marcia (December 11, 1994). \"In 'Lost Moon', Astronaut Recalls Apollo Scare\".

Maggie Goes on a Diet is a children's book by Paul Kramer about weight management in childhood aimed towards children aged 6\u201312. According to WorldCat, the book is held in 19 libraries as of May, 2015.\nThe book has been criticized for its portrayal of weight loss in a book aimed towards young children, with parents and critics claiming that it could be potentially harmful to the very people that the book seeks to help. Film director Darryl Roberts states \"We have to protect our children. Everyone's looking at today's youth as advertising opportunities, and it's screwing them up. A 6-year-old shouldn't be reading a book about someone who lost weight, became popular and life became better.\" Some consumers have chosen to boycott the book on Amazon, claiming that its message can be harmful.\nAuthor Paul Kramer has defended his book, stating, \"Maggie is accepting that kids are mean and kids can be mean and she has decided to do something about it, to take things in her own hands, try to change her own life, try to make herself healthy by exercising. She does want to look better. She does want to feel better and she does not want to be teased.\" Physician William Sears defended the work in a 2012 discussion, as he liked the book's moral of Maggie recognizing and taking responsibility for her obesity.\nMy Beautiful Mommy\nChildhood Obesity\nSaguy, Abigail (2013).

The Oz books in total sold almost twice as many copies in 1919 as in 1918, and 1918 had been an exceptionally good year.

He lusts after the 17-year-old Margot whom he meets at a cinema, where she works, and woos her over the course of many encounters, primarily with money. His prolonged affair with Margot is eventually revealed to Albinus's wife Elisabeth when Margot deliberately sends a letter to the Albinuses' residence and Albinus is unable to intercept it before it is discovered. Elisabeth leaves with the assistance of her brother, Paul, and takes their daughter, Irma, with her. Rather than disown the young troublemaker, Albinus is even more attracted to Margot. She eventually manipulates him into allowing her to move in to his flat where he resided with his wife, and she sets to working on him getting a divorce so that she might marry him and acquire access to his significant wealth.\nMargot uses Albinus to fulfill her ambition in life to become a rich film star. Even when Albinus' daughter, Irma, takes ill and eventually succumbs to pneumonia, Margot insistently drives a wedge between his old life and his new, in order to totalize her capture of him. Inadvertently, Albinus introduces Margot to Axel Rex at one of his many dinner parties, but he does not know that the two have previously been lovers. Margot and Rex resume their relationship, and start plotting to get Albinus out of the way and rob him of his money. \nAlbinus gets Margot her first role as an actress, using his wealth as largesse to make up for her lack of talent. At the premiere viewing of the movie, Margot realises how inept she was and is petulant about her public exposure as a mediocre actress. Attempting to appease her wounded ego, Albinus convinces her to take a holiday to the south in the new car he has bought for her. Rex refuses to be left behind, and by this point has wangled his way into Albinus' confidence as a fellow artist (including convincing Albinus that he could not possibly be interested in Margot as he poses himself as homosexual): he presents himself as the ideal chauffeur for their trip, given that Albinus can barely drive. Rex and Margot's trysts have become increasingly brazen, and the holiday seems an opportunity to further deepen their affair on Albinus' payroll.\nThe holiday didn't quite go as Margot and Rex planned, since rendezvouses were next to impossible without arousing suspicion. On arriving in a small town and finding most lodgings unavailable, they finally get their chance in the only remaining hotel room the three could find, which shared a bathroom and made clandestine access possible. After a chance encounter with an old friend in the town, Albinus realises that Margot and Rex are engaged in an affair. Enraged, Albinus returns to the hotel and threatens Margot, who insists that there is nothing between her and the allegedly homosexual Rex. Still distraught, Albinus demands they leave at once, and they abandon Rex at the hotel. On their journey out of town, Albinus crashes the car and is blinded, leaving him in need of care and oblivious to the world around him.\nRex and Margot take advantage of his handicap. After sending a letter falsely stating that Rex has gone to America, they rent a chalet in Switzerland where Rex poses as Albinus's doctor, although Albinus is unaware of Rex's presence. Rex mocks and tortures Albinus during his recovery. Albinus becomes increasingly suspicious as his ears become more attuned and he perceives someone's presence, although Margot continuously denies his concerns.\n \nPaul, Albinus's brother-in-law, suspects forgery when he encounters multiple high value cheques on Albinus' account at their shared bank, with the signature scrawled and the amounts in a different handwriting (Rex and Margot have been bleeding Albinus's accounts dry and coercing him into signing blind)."

It was first published in Russkie Zapiski in Paris in the same year. Nabokov translated it at that time into English for the first time. The second English translation was made by Dmitri Nabokov in 1964 with the help of his father who also made some alterations; it was published in 1966. The play takes place in an unnamed country in about 1935. Nabokov makes the point in the 1965 written foreword  that while the work sounds a \"prophetic forenote\" - the invention is a weapon of mass destruction -, he has no political message and does not support the peaceniks of his time.",

Act 1: In the office of the Minister of War: The minister of war receives Salvator Waltz  - \" a haggard inventor, a fellow author\" - who declares that he controls a new machine of immense destructive power called Telemort or Telethanasia  that can blow up cities, mountains, even countries. The minister dismisses him as a nut. Shortly thereafter a mountain in the vista of his windows blows up exactly at the time predicted by Waltz. He is called back and explains to the dubious minister that this was indeed the planned experiment to showcase his weapon; the minister and his advisor are not yet convinced and do not know what to do. Trance (in Russian her name is son, meaning dream), a journalist who becomes Waltz's assistant suggests to appoint a committee. Annabella appears and indicates that on the mountain lived once an old enchanter and a snow-white gazelle.\nAct 2: In the Council Hall of the Ministry: A committee of bumbling old generals is in session to decide what to do after more experimental explosion have made it clear that the power of the weapon is enormous. Trance suggests to buy it. Waltz is called and offered money but refuses to sell it. He declares that he has the weapon to create a new world order, war and military and politics become superfluous. Waltz shows his side as a poet when he extols the New Life where he will be the \"keeper of the garden key\". Annabella, the daughter of a general, objects to the \"bad dreams\" Waltz has, but Waltz prevails and is welcomed as the new ruler.\nAct 3: In the office of the Minister of War: Waltz is in charge but bored by the day-to-day drudgery of governing. There was an assassination attempt on him presumably by a foreign agent, and in response he blows up the city of Santa Morgana. He plans to move to the island of Palmera and from time to time check on the affairs of government which should be easy as no country will be able to resist him. He demands luxury and servitude. His dream is becoming a nightmare. A parade of women is shown to him to please him, one of them citing a poem he had written a long time ago, but he wants Annabella. He summons her father who, however, refuses to submit; he will not deliver his daughter to Waltz. Waltz threatens to blow up everything, but Trance now makes it clear: there is no Telemort machine. It all was the imagination of Waltz. Reality now sets in, the real interview of Waltz takes place. The minister rejects him in less than a minute, opens the window, the mountain is still there, and Waltz is taken to the madhouse.\nThe first production had been planned for 1939 by a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 company but World War II intervened. The first Russian production was performed by the Oxford University Russian Club in 1968, and the English version was first produced by the Hartford Stage Company, Hartford, Connecticut, in 1969\nIn the foreword Nabokov indicates that \"if ... the action of the play is absurd, it is because this is the way mad Waltz - before the play starts - imagines it is going to be...\". In contrast to the \"black pit of reality\", Nabokov wants the scenery colorful and rich and the uniforms of the generals \"must glow like Christmas trees\". The generals names were Berg, Breg, Brig, Brug, Gerb, Grab, Grib, Gorb, Grob, and Grub originally, and are changed to Bump, Dump, Gump, Hump, Lump, Mump, Rump, Stump, Tump, Ump, and Zump in the final English translation. Three of the generals are dummies.\nThe play has received a mixed response. At the time of the 1966 publication, Time criticized Nabokov's play as a \"cloud-capped tower of fantasy (that falls) to a dusty heap of speculation\". It noted its \"savage humor\" and described it as a \"prophetic, satyrical play\". Morris indicated that the play \"with its grotesque combination of lyrical poetry, subdued\nemotional pain and manic, farcical activity, approximates the absurdist dimensions of an\nIonesco or Beckett\". The Time review from 1969 performance sees the play as a parable of the writer who tears things down and rebuilds new worlds. Nabokov himself sees Waltz as a tragic figure.\n\nLiterary Encyclopedia\n\"Nabokov in Embryo\", Time article from 01-24-1969 accessed 04-06-2008\nPaul D.

Haunted is a 2005 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. The plot is a frame story for a series of 23 short stories, most preceded by a free verse poem. Each story is followed by a chapter of the main narrative, is told by a character in main narrative, and ties back into the main story in some way. Typical of Palahniuk's work, the dominant motifs in Haunted are sexual deviance, sexual identity, desperation, social distastefulness, disease, murder, death, and existentialism.\nThe synopsis on the dustjacket describes Haunted as a satire of reality television, but according to Palahniuk, the novel is actually about \"the battle for credibility\" that has resulted from the ease with which one can publish through the use of modern technology.\nThe cover of the 2006 U.S. trade paperback reprint features a glow-in-the-dark image.\nThe following are the 19 characters in the main narrative, along with the stories they tell:\nThe book is best known for the short story \"Guts\", which had been published before the book in the March 2004 issue of Playboy magazine as well as on Palahniuk's website. It is a tale of violent accidents involving masturbation, in which the reader is instructed to hold their breath in the very first line.\nA New York City public school 11th grade teacher was suspended for letting his English class read \"Guts\".\nHaunted received mixed to favorable reviews from critics upon its release. Haunted received a negative review from The New York Times columnist Tom Shone who noted that despite being referred to as a horror novel it is \"...stubbornly unscary. It burps up its shock moments with so little ceremony that the Gothic virtue of stealthily sidewinding suspense -- the art of allowing a story to steal up on you before you even knew it was there -- is left whistling in the wind.\" Shone additionally noted the repetitive nature of many of the stories within the novel noting that every single story regardless of which character was narrating all utilized Palahniuk's distinctive style.\nTasha Robinson of The A.V. Club reviewed the novel soon after its release giving it a positive review, stating \"...Palahniuk is as unique and colorful as ever, with his predilection for odd factoids and weird twists. But none of this makes the arbitrary deaths, the ludicrous behavior, or the pages upon pages about corpse-rot and vivisection any easier to deal with. Like his characters, Palahniuk sometimes seems to be operating under the presumption that he can never sink too low, or vomit up too much.

Haunted is a 2005 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. The plot is a frame story for a series of 23 short stories, most preceded by a free verse poem. Each story is followed by a chapter of the main narrative, is told by a character in main narrative, and ties back into the main story in some way. Typical of Palahniuk's work, the dominant motifs in Haunted are sexual deviance, sexual identity, desperation, social distastefulness, disease, murder, death, and existentialism.\nThe synopsis on the dustjacket describes Haunted as a satire of reality television, but according to Palahniuk, the novel is actually about \"the battle for credibility\" that has resulted from the ease with which one can publish through the use of modern technology.\nThe cover of the 2006 U.S. trade paperback reprint features a glow-in-the-dark image.\nThe following are the 19 characters in the main narrative, along with the stories they tell:\nThe book is best known for the short story \"Guts\", which had been published before the book in the March 2004 issue of Playboy magazine as well as on Palahniuk's website. It is a tale of violent accidents involving masturbation, in which the reader is instructed to hold their breath in the very first line.\nA New York City public school 11th grade teacher was suspended for letting his English class read \"Guts\".\nHaunted received mixed to favorable reviews from critics upon its release. Haunted received a negative review from The New York Times columnist Tom Shone who noted that despite being referred to as a horror novel it is \"...stubbornly unscary. It burps up its shock moments with so little ceremony that the Gothic virtue of stealthily sidewinding suspense -- the art of allowing a story to steal up on you before you even knew it was there -- is left whistling in the wind.\" Shone additionally noted the repetitive nature of many of the stories within the novel noting that every single story regardless of which character was narrating all utilized Palahniuk's distinctive style.\nTasha Robinson of The A.V. Club reviewed the novel soon after its release giving it a positive review, stating \"...Palahniuk is as unique and colorful as ever, with his predilection for odd factoids and weird twists. But none of this makes the arbitrary deaths, the ludicrous behavior, or the pages upon pages about corpse-rot and vivisection any easier to deal with. Like his characters, Palahniuk sometimes seems to be operating under the presumption that he can never sink too low, or vomit up too much. Here's hoping he's wrong, for everyone's sake.\"\nISBN\u00a00-385-50948-0 (hardcover, 2005)\nISBN\u00a01-4000-3282-2 (paperback, 2006)\nBuffa, Denise (November 9, 2009). \"Teacher suspended for giving 'self pleasure' reading to students\".

The plot follows two main characters living at different times: the first is Stephen Wraysford, a British soldier on the front line in Amiens during the First World War, and the second is his granddaughter, Elizabeth Benson, whose 1970s plotline follows her attempts to recover an understanding of Stephen's experience of the war. Faulks developed the novel to bring more public awareness to the experience of war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on how the experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. ...",

Faulks wrote the novel partly because he felt that the First World War had not been discussed enough in both literary and historical contexts. Reflecting on the novel twenty years later, Faulks felt that the published version did not fully do justice to the experience of war: it did not provide readers with \"a full appreciation of the soldiers' physical experience; and, perhaps more importantly, a philosophical understanding of what it meant to be part of the first genocidal event of the century \u2013 the one that made the others imaginable\".\nBecause Faulks felt that much of the extant World War I literature was deeply influenced by World War II literature, he deliberately avoided research with secondary documents, such as historical monographs, instead focusing on veteran interviews and period primary sources.\nThe novel was a success, with international impact and attention. The hardback print-run, first issued in 1993, sold 14,000 copies. The novel featured in many \"Best of the Year lists\" in the United Kingdom during 1993. Subsequently, the novel has become one of the most checked-out works from British libraries.\nThough Faulks's fourth published novel in the United Kingdom, Birdsong was only his second republished in the United States.  In New Zealand and Australia, the novel was popular, reaching best seller and \"what's hot\" lists. The novel was also sold in translation in Italy, France, Spain, Latin America, Germany, Portugal, Brazil, Denmark, Poland, Israel, Sweden, Estonia, Japan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Finland and the Netherlands. Globally, sales were strong, and as of 2010, the novel had sold over 3 million copies.\nBirdsong has an episodic structure, and is split into seven sections which move between three different periods of time before, during and after the war in the Stephen Wraysford plot, and three different windows of time in the 1970s Benson plot.\nThe first stage starts in pre-war Amiens, France. Stephen Wraysford visits and lives with Ren\u00e9 Azaire, his wife Isabelle and their children. Azaire teaches Stephen about the French textile industry. He witnesses a comfortable middle class life in Northern France alongside industrial worker unrest. Azaire and the significantly younger Isabelle express discontent with their marriage. This sparks Stephen's interest in Isabelle, with whom he soon falls in love. During one incident, Azaire, embarrassed that he and Isabelle cannot have another child, beats her in a jealous rage. Around the same time, Isabelle helps give food to the families of striking workers, stirring rumours that she is having an affair with one of the workers.\nStephen's love of Isabelle transforms into a passionate affair. Isabelle confronts Azaire with the truth of their relationship and Azaire evicts Stephen. Isabelle leaves with him, running away to Southern France. There she becomes pregnant, and momentarily loses faith in her relationship with Stephen. Without telling Stephen, she flees, returning to her family home and the one constant in her life: her sister Jeanne. Later, Isabelle's father makes a deal with Azaire for her return to maintain her honour; Isabelle is forgiven but soon regrets leaving her true love, Stephen. However, she does not reach back out to Stephen.\nThe second section rejoins Stephen, when he is a lieutenant in the British Army at the start of the war. Through his eyes, Faulks tells the reader about the first day on the Somme in July 1916 and the Battle of Messines near Ypres in the following year.\nSeveral episodes depict a downtrodden Stephen whose only respite is his friendship with Captain Michael Weir and his men. Stephen gains the reputation of a cold and distant officer. He refuses all offers of leave, because he is committed  to fighting  the war.\nHis story is interleaved with that of Jack Firebrace, a former miner employed with the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers in the British trenches to listen for the enemy and plant mines under the German trenches. In one expedition across No-Man's Land, Stephen is badly injured but survives.\nDuring these episodes, Stephen feels lonely and writes to Isabelle, feeling that there is no one else to whom he can express his feelings. He writes about his fears that he will die, and confesses that he has only ever loved her.\nAlongside the main story, there is the narrative of Stephen's granddaughter, Elizabeth, who, whilst struggling with her already married boyfriend, Robert, unearths Stephen's journals from World War I and seeks to learns about his experiences at Marne, Verdun and the Somme. She discovers that Stephen's journals are encoded, but"

Immediately after the events of the previous story, Zack Freeman and the entire chapel are crushed under a giant brown blob. He manages to escape with his bum and Eleanor, but the others cannot be rescued in time. As they attempt to do so, four Great White Bums descend from the sky and attempt to crush the protagonists under more giant brown blobs, but are saved, and believed to be burned to death by, another Great White Bum. The group discovers that they have been teleported inside a spacecraft disguised as a Great White Bum named Robobum, which was constructed and is being operated by Ned Smelly. Ned reveals that he had no idea that the zombie bumvasion has happened, as he had been trapped underground in a giant stinkant cave in search for their juice, a rare and sought-after fuel for his spacecraft. After discovering a massive reservoir of the juice and mapping out the cave, Ned had discovered three skeletons huddled under a warning written on the cave wall. One of the skeletons was holding a piece of soap that Zack realizes belonged to his grandmother (who had been sucked into a brown hole along with the Forker, the Flicker, the Great White Bum and his cronies, the Prince and Maurice). The warning foretold to future readers that Great White Bum was using the brown hole to send prehistoric bumosaurs to the future in order to bring along Bumageddon.\nThe group realizes that they can prevent Bumageddon by killing the Great White Bum with the arseteroid that killed the bumosaurs. The group use Robobum to travel back sixty-five million years, but accidentally travel back six hundred and fifty million years due to an error in Robobum's system. There, they realize that they have landed at the exact moment that the Great White Bum hatched from its egg, and Zack attempts to kill it, believing that he will stop Bumageddon by doing so. The Great White Bum escapes and is pursued by the group in Robobum, where Zack inadvertently fixes the time-travel glitch and causes Robobum to travel to the correct era. The group is forced to abandon Robobum when a tyrannosore-arse rex attacks, leaving Robobum to fight it. After a near miss with a tricerabutt, the group is saved by a bum, who agrees to take them to the Crack of Doom to stop the Great White Bum.\nAt night, the bum recalls her former owner, a child who took good care of her and then abandoned her for no reason. The group is kidnapped by giant stinkants and taken into their nest, where Zack and Eleanor find the freshly-written and incomplete warning. Zack's grandmother, the Pincher, reveals herself along with the Flicker and the Forker, who were responsible for the message. Robobum saves the group from a giant stinkant attack and teleports the group inside, but leaves behind the three aging bum-fighters, who have to stay behind and complete the message.\nZack's bum and the tour guide bum fight over who was responsible for keeping the group safe, with Eleanor breaking up the fight and revealing that the tour guide bum is her bum. Eleanor explains that she got rid of her bum after the Great White Bum killed her mother, in order to become a bum-fighter and get her revenge. Her bum angrily leaves the craft, despite Eleanor's pleas to stay.\nRobobum detects a molecular signature exactly that of the Great White Bum at a nearby location and determines that the Crack of Doom is at this point. The group tries to depart, but realizes that they are stuck in bumantula webs. While Eleanor and Ned try to cut Robobum out of the web, Zack and his bum rescue a creature stuck in the web. They discover that the creature is the kisser, who was consumed by mutant zombie maggots in the previous book and regurgitated in the past when they became blowflies, leaving him in his liquid form. Zack believes his claim that he is on their side and rescues him. The group retreat into the craft as a bumantula latches onto it, almost crushing Robobum and killing her occupants as she attempts to fly away. She is rescued by the Great White Bum, who believes that she is a real bum, and falls in love with him.\nRealizing their opportunity, the group plots to stop Bumageddon by accepting the Great White Bum's marriage proposal and paralyzing him at their wedding at the Crack of Doom, hours before the arseteroid is due to hit the site. Robobum is carried away by a bumodactyl up to its nest, where Eleanor discovers her bum being fed to its chicks. Eleanor and Zack rescue Eleanor's bum before the Great White Bum arrives, but returns to see that the Kisser has shot Ned dead. Realizing"

The book opens in spring, when a young indigenous girl named Katherena and her mother leave their home by the sea and move into a countryside residence. Katherena has difficulty adjusting to her new home and no longer enjoys drawing at her new desk. Seeing her loneliness, Katherena's mother asks her to visit their older neighbour Agnes, a clay artist. Katherena becomes friends with Agnes. Katherena shows her paintings to Agnes, who shows Katherena her garden and clay-shaped birds and animals. Katherena teaches Agnes Cree words while Agnes tells her about rural life. During the fall, Katherena helps Agnes in her garden by preparing the soil for next spring and feeding worms. By winter, Agnes cannot go outside her home. Katherena and her mother prepare salmon stew and take it to Agnes's home. With the passage of the seasons, Agnes becomes frail, yet the bond between Katherena and Agnes keeps growing. They continue to share their mutual love for flora, fauna, and art while their strengthening relationship allows Katherena to grow.\nBirdsong touches upon the themes of intergenerational friendship, growth in human connections, passion for art, and seasonal cycles. The book is split into seasonal segments. The intergenerational relationship between Katherena and Agnes is portrayed using the cycle of seasons\u2014spring, summer, fall, winter, spring. Professor Gregory Bryan of the University of Manitoba interpreted the seasonal passage of time as \"the renewal of the cycle of life\" and argued that the same was true for the changing connection between Katherena and Agnes. Bryan notes that the theme gives the impression that this cycle will continue with an aged Katherena yielding \"her place [to] a younger person who has evolved and been endowed with wisdom gained through an acquaintance with Katherena\". \nThe book makes use of digital compositions that employ pencils and pastel colours, and are prominently characterized by Flett's minimalist art style. Katherena is depicted as a girl with brown skin and straight, black hair. The pastoral scenery is shown using flat green spaces that change colours with each season and include delicate flowers and colourful birds, shown in silhouette. Katherena's paintings of birds have been illustrated to appear soft and fuzzy, while the snowy winter air is depicted with more haze. The book was described by critics as sparse and poetic. Cree words used throughout the book are explained within the contents of the book and in a glossary at the beginning.\nReviewers praised the book for its seasonal arrangement, portrayal of relationships, and minimalist illustrations. Sujei Lugo of The Horn Book Magazine praised the book's \"smooth and lyrical\" writing and the illustrations for \"portraying the emotional journey of Agnes and Katherena\". Lugo felt that these show the affection of the protagonists and help encapsulate the practice of honouring elders. In an article published in The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, Kate Quealy-Gainer commended its artwork, which she described as \"both flattened and textured with subdued tones that follow the changing seasons accordingly\". Kirkus Reviews agreed and called the book \"emotionally stunning\".\nGiving the book a three-out-of-five-stars score, Bryan acknowledged the \"enticing illustrations [and] sweet lyrical prose\", and the portrayal of intergenerational friendship. Publishers Weekly regarded the book as a \"subtle, sensitive story\" that describes themes of maturation and loss through art, time, and friendship. The publication particularly praised the glossary of Cree words which attached \"an intimate layer of identity\" to the story. Calling the book \"simple and profound\", Laken Hotten of School Library Journal notes the message that \"a new friend can make a new place feel like home\".\nSeveral publications including the The Horn Book Magazine, Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, and School Library Journal listed Birdsong as among the best picture books of 2019. The book was awarded the 2020 TD Canadian Children's Literature Award, and was named as one of the finalists for the Governor General's Literary Award. The book received an honour title at the 2020 American Indian Youth Literature Awards.\n\"Birdsong | Kirkus Reviews\". Kirkus Reviews. July 1, 2019. Archived from the original on January 26, 2021.

                "description": "Birdsong is a 1993 war novel and family saga by the English author Sebastian Faulks. It is Faulks's fourth novel. The plot follows two main characters living at different times: the first is Stephen Wraysford, a British soldier on the front line in Amiens during the First World War, and the second is his granddaughter, Elizabeth Benson, whose 1970s plotline follows her attempts to recover an understanding of Stephen's experience of the war. Faulks developed the novel to bring more public awareness to the experience of war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on how the experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. ...",

Faulks wrote the novel partly because he felt that the First World War had not been discussed enough in both literary and historical contexts. Reflecting on the novel twenty years later, Faulks felt that the published version did not fully do justice to the experience of war: it did not provide readers with \"a full appreciation of the soldiers' physical experience; and, perhaps more importantly, a philosophical understanding of what it meant to be part of the first genocidal event of the century \u2013 the one that made the others imaginable\".\nBecause Faulks felt that much of the extant World War I literature was deeply influenced by World War II literature, he deliberately avoided research with secondary documents, such as historical monographs, instead focusing on veteran interviews and period primary sources.\nThe novel was a success, with international impact and attention. The hardback print-run, first issued in 1993, sold 14,000 copies. The novel featured in many \"Best of the Year lists\" in the United Kingdom during 1993. Subsequently, the novel has become one of the most checked-out works from British libraries.\nThough Faulks's fourth published novel in the United Kingdom, Birdsong was only his second republished in the United States.  In New Zealand and Australia, the novel was popular, reaching best seller and \"what's hot\" lists. The novel was also sold in translation in Italy, France, Spain, Latin America, Germany, Portugal, Brazil, Denmark, Poland, Israel, Sweden, Estonia, Japan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Finland and the Netherlands. Globally, sales were strong, and as of 2010, the novel had sold over 3 million copies.\nBirdsong has an episodic structure, and is split into seven sections which move between three different periods of time before, during and after the war in the Stephen Wraysford plot, and three different windows of time in the 1970s Benson plot.\nThe first stage starts in pre-war Amiens, France. Stephen Wraysford visits and lives with Ren\u00e9 Azaire, his wife Isabelle and their children. Azaire teaches Stephen about the French textile industry. He witnesses a comfortable middle class life in Northern France alongside industrial worker unrest. Azaire and the significantly younger Isabelle express discontent with their marriage. This sparks Stephen's interest in Isabelle, with whom he soon falls in love. During one incident, Azaire, embarrassed that he and Isabelle cannot have another child, beats her in a jealous rage. Around the same time, Isabelle helps give food to the families of striking workers, stirring rumours that she is having an affair with one of the workers.\nStephen's love of Isabelle transforms into a passionate affair. Isabelle confronts Azaire with the truth of their relationship and Azaire evicts Stephen. Isabelle leaves with him, running away to Southern France. There she becomes pregnant, and momentarily loses faith in her relationship with Stephen. Without telling Stephen, she flees, returning to her family home and the one constant in her life: her sister Jeanne. Later, Isabelle's father makes a deal with Azaire for her return to maintain her honour; Isabelle is forgiven but soon regrets leaving her true love, Stephen. However, she does not reach back out to Stephen.\nThe second section rejoins Stephen, when he is a lieutenant in the British Army at the start of the war. Through his eyes, Faulks tells the reader about the first day on the Somme in July 1916 and the Battle of Messines near Ypres in the following year.\nSeveral episodes depict a downtrodden Stephen whose only respite is his friendship with Captain Michael Weir and his men. Stephen gains the reputation of a cold and distant officer. He refuses all offers of leave, because he is committed  to fighting  the war.\nHis story is interleaved with that of Jack Firebrace, a former miner employed with the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers in the British trenches to listen for the enemy and plant mines under the German trenches. In one expedition across No-Man's Land, Stephen is badly injured but survives.\nDuring these episodes, Stephen feels lonely and writes to Isabelle, feeling that there is no one else to whom he can express his feelings. He writes about his fears that he will die, and confesses that he has only ever loved her.\nAlongside the main story, there is the narrative of Stephen's granddaughter, Elizabeth, who, whilst struggling with her already married boyfriend, Robert, unearths Stephen's journals from World War I and seeks to learns about his experiences at Marne, Verdun and the Somme. She discovers that Stephen's journals are encoded, but"

Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime \u2014 This is unquestionably the best of the Nero Wolfe \"threesomes,\" containing as it does the little masterpiece called \"The Next Witness\", about a telephone-answering service; \"When a Man Murders\", a first-rate Enoch Arden tale; \"Die Like a Dog\", in which a dog and a raincoat mixed up figure prominently and skillfully. Archie is tops in all, and in the first we not only enjoy Wolfe subpoenaed and in a courtroom, but subsequently driving around and doing genuine detection on the hoof.\nAnthony Boucher, The New York Times Book Review (March 18, 1956) \u2014 Tantalizingly, the Viking Press informs us that one of the three novelettes in Rex Stout's Three Witnesses \"happens to be Stout's favorite among all the novelettes he has written.\" Which one? Viking isn't telling; but I'll agree that one entry here is at least as good as any I can remember among some two dozen novelettes of Nero Wolfe. \"Die Like a Dog\" (which, just to be confusing, appeared in American as \"The Body in the Hall\" and in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine as \"A Dog in the Daytime\") combines one of Stout's most entertaining pictures of life in the menage at 918 West Thirty-fifth, as the hard-headed Nero turns out to be a dog lover at heart, with one of the best pure puzzles I've read in years: a technical model in the fair play and misdirection of the classic adventure form. The other two novelettes here assembled are only slightly less good; and connoisseurs will note with interest the fact that one of them succeeds, incredibly, in keeping Wolfe away from the comforts  of Thirty-fifth Street for an entire case.\n1956, New York: Viking Press, March 10, 1956, hardcover\nIn his limited-edition pamphlet, Collecting Mystery Fiction #10, Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe Part II, Otto Penzler describes the first edition of Three Witnesses: \"Pale blue cloth, front cover and spine printed with gold; front and rear covers blank. Issued in a red, black and white dust wrapper.\"\nIn April 2006, Firsts: The Book Collector's Magazine estimated that the first edition of Three Witnesses had a value of between $200 and $350. The estimate is for a copy in very good to fine condition in a like dustjacket.\nThe \"concept-driven\" dustjacket designed by Bill English was cited by graphic design scholar Steven Heller for its spare use of color, sans-serif typography and use of the entire front and back cover area.\n1956, Toronto: Macmillan, 1956, hardcover\n1956, New York: Viking Press (Mystery Guild), June 1956, hardcover\nThe far less valuable Viking book club edition may be distinguished from the first edition in three ways:\nThe dust jacket has \"Book Club Edition\" printed on the inside front flap, and the price is absent (first editions may be price clipped if they were given as gifts).\nBook club editions are sometimes thinner and always taller (usually a quarter of an inch) than first editions.\nBook club editions are bound in cardboard, and first editions are bound in cloth (or have at least a cloth spine).\n1956, London: Collins Crime Club, October 22, 1956, hardcover\n1957, New York: Bantam Books, July 1957, paperback\n1965, New York: Viking Press, Royal Flush (with Fer-de-Lance and Murder by the Book), July 23, 1965, hardcover\n1976, London: Hamish Hamilton, 1976\n1994, New York: Bantam Crimeline ISBN\u00a00-553-24959-2 October 1994, paperback, Rex Stout Library edition with introduction by Susan Conant\n1997, Newport Beach, California: Books on Tape, Inc.

Across the Sea of Suns is a 1984 hard science fiction novel by American writer Gregory Benford. It is the second novel in his Galactic Center Saga, and continues to follow the scientist Nigel Walmsley, who encountered an extraterrestrial machine in the previous book, In the Ocean of Night, aboard an expeditionary spacecraft, searching for life. Eventually Nigel discovers evidence of the major conflict in the galaxy.\nAt some point after the publication of one or more sequels (beginning with Great Sky River, for the American paperback edition), Benford appended a new ending onto the original ending of the novel. The following section is from the second edition of the book to bridge over to the continuance of the Galactic Core Saga:\nThe Watcher is eventually blinded by being coated with a life-form native to the moon, which eats metals and other such materials, thus allowing the humans to board the ship.  The boarding party discovers a map of the galaxy marked with places significant to the machines, and a fast vessel to take them to those places. Now the leader, Nigel vetoes suggestions that they return to Earth and quoting Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (\"Le's all slide out of here one of these nights and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns over in the territory; and I says all right, that suits me.\") energizes everyone for a voyage to the Galactic Center, the most important place of all for the machines. Earth's ocean-borne myriads, now partnered with the Skimmers against the Swarmers, will just have to fend for themselves.\nDave Langford reviewed Across the Sea of Suns for White Dwarf #58, and stated that \"a fat, impressive demonstration that one can do ultra-'hard' SF with every rivet places just so, and still write well. It helps if like Benford you're a professor of physics...\"\nThe star is apparently Lalande 21185, also known as BD\u00a0+36\u00a02147.

Beasts of No Nation is a 2005 novel by the Nigerian-American author Uzodinma Iweala, that takes its title from Fela Kuti's 1989 album with the same name. The book was adapted as a movie in 2015.\nThe novel follows the journey of a young boy, Agu, who is forced to join a group of soldiers in an unnamed West African country. While Agu fears his commander and many of the men around him, his fledgling childhood has been brutally shattered by the war raging through his country, and he is at first conflicted by simultaneous revulsion and fascination with the mechanics of war. Iweala does not shy away from explicit, visceral detail and paints a complex, difficult picture of Agu as a child soldier. The book does not give any direct clue as to which country it takes place in, and it remains undisclosed. The book is notable for its confrontational, immersive first-person narrative.\nThe theme of child soldiers draws on the author's Harvard thesis. The writer never experienced the events he writes about in his novel unlike other books in the same genre.\nA feature film was adapted by Cary Fukunaga, starring Abraham Attah as Agu and Idris Elba as the commander. The film is an international production, shot on location in the jungles of Ghana.

Celia en el colegio (\"Celia at the school\" or \"Celia at school\") is the second in the series of Celia novels by Elena Fort\u00fan, first published in 1932 according to records. The books told the stories of a little girl named Celia living in Spain during the 1930s.  In this second book, Celia was sent to a convent, for her parents found her a handful, and facing numerous financial problems at home, they had trouble looking after Celia and keeping her out of mischief.  The books were largely popular in the years following their publication, and were enjoyed by both children and adults.  Celia's many adventures and misadventures, as well as her mischievous character appealed to children, while at the same time, older readers were able to pick up references to a changing and growing nation hidden behind Celia's childlike fantasy world.  Most prints of the first books featured a large variety of black and white illustrations by Molina Gallent, some of which were later featured in the opening credits of the TV-series from Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola.  Other prints and re-issues featured illustrations from other artists such as Asun Balzola.\nIn 1992, Spanish film director Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau adapted the series into a six-episode TV series simply entitled Celia.  In it, child actress Cristina Cruz M\u00ednguez played the title role of Celia, while Ana Duato (M\u00e9dico de familia, 1995) and Pedro D\u00edez del Corral played her parents.  The series, like the books, found great success originally, but eventually that success faded and today the series is not very well known.  \"En el colegio\" was the title of the fourth episode in the series and the first to be adapted from the second book, Celia en el colegio.\nCelia en el colegio was adapted as part of Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola's 1992 TV-series directed by Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau, Celia.  The series was a faithful adaptation of many events from the book and it often relied on very similar, if not exact, dialogue.  The adapting of Celia en el colegio spanned three episodes: IV. \"En el colegio\", V. \"Ni santa, ni m\u00e1rtir\" and VI. \"\u00a1Hasta la vista!\".  Many scenes were removed and absent from the series; one example of this is a part in the novel involving Celia being punished to spend some time up in Madre Florinda's chamber, when Celia, believing the nun to have died gives her belongings to a group of homeless boys and girls.  Though the entire part was not touched in the series, the character of Madre Florinda, who can be seen supported by a crutch, was included briefly in the series, if only with a few minor appearances as an extra and just one single line.\nOnly five of the nuns were referred to by name in the series: Madre Loreto, Madre Bibiana, Madre Coraz\u00f3n, Madre Isolina and the Madre Superiora (the Mother Superior), all of whom appeared in the novel.  Certain scenes and incidents from the novel involving the nuns were \"traded\" around.  For example, in the novel, Madre Mercedes is the one responsible for teaching sewing to the girls, while in the series, it was Madre Bibiana who had that task and whom failed at teaching Celia how to sew properly.  Another example, in the novel, Madre Consuelo had the ingenious idea of having the girls learn only the answers to the questions they would each be asked in the final examination given by the Madre Superiora, which turned out a complete disaster.  In the series however, it was Madre Loreto who had the idea and who was embarrassed by Celia's explaining of the situation.  The same with Celia's classmates; only Elguibia, whom differenced from the others due to her slight case of mental retardation, was given a consistent name.  The other girl actresses played Celia's friends from the novel inconsistently and were never given real names, at least they were not mentioned.\n Other events were altered from the novel in order to give the series a more dramatic appeal.  For example, in the novel, Celia does not have a good time during the end-of-the-year plays as she is excluded from participating.  However, in the series Celia does have a part in the play; shortly before her performance, Do\u00f1a Benita feels the need to tell Celia the truth about how her parents had closed down their house in Madrid.  How they, together with Celia's brother \"Cuchifrit\u00edn\" would leave \"for China\" and how she would spend the summer with the nuns instead of going to the beach with her parents.  Celia, heartbroken with the news, cleverly alters her rhyming lines in the play"

Swim That Rock is a book by John Rocco, a children's author/illustrator, and Jay Primiano, former Charlestown Parks & Recreation Director. It was published by Candlewick Press in 2014 and is Primiano's first book. Its lexile score of 750L makes it appropriate for readers aged 12\u201318 years.\nSwim that Rock follows a teenager named Jake Cole after his father disappears while at sea. Jake must work as a fisherman to help his family repay a loan, or else face moving away from his New England home. The book was positively received by critics. Although reviewers note the predictable nature of the story and unoriginal language, the book has been lauded as an authentic portrait of life in coastal Rhode Island and an \"entertaining coming-of-age story\".\nThe novel was inspired by the shared experiences of the two authors John Rocco and Jay Primiano, both of whom grew up in Rhode Island. Rocco (then 11) met Primiano (then 19) when the latter was repairing his boat at a mutual friend's home, and got a job working for Primiano as a fisherman. The two remained friends even after pursuing different careers. Primiano became a poet, living in Jamestown, Rhode Island; Rocco pursued a career as a children's book illustrator (and later, author) and moved to Los Angeles, California.\nRocco approached Primiano about collaborating on a book sometime in 2004, although the two did not actually start writing Swim that Rock until 2008. Living far apart, the two first collaborated via email, with Primiano sending approximately 4000 words a day to Rocco for him to \"cull through...[and] pick out the literary pearls\". Eventually, Rocco and Primiano rented a house in Mystic, Connecticut to collaborate in-person and finished their first manuscript. They had difficulty securing a publisher until Rocco spoke to Candlewick Press president Karen Lotz, who finally took up the book. At the time, Rocco was working on several illustration projects with the publisher. The book was edited even further before publication in April 2014.\nThe book's title is derived from a time when Rocco was working for Primiano on the latter's boat. Primiano, looking to challenge his companion, gave Rocco a large rock to swim to a neighboring boat some 200 yards away, ostensibly because the other boat's captain needed it to build a rock wall around his home. In the novel, Jake asks Gene Hassard (one of Jake's father's friends) if Gene will initiate him by making him \"swim with a rock\". The older man replies that Jake already has \"[his] own rock to swim\", which becomes a metaphor for the boy's difficulties throughout the book. Other events in the novel are also based on real-life experiences of either Rocco or Primiano, as are a number of characters. In particular, the book's Gene Hassard is based on Primiano's first boss, Gene Beebe. The fishermen and diner workers as well were based on real people from the pair's lives, albeit more generally.\nThe authors stated that they were working on a sequel continuing Jake Cole's story as early as June 2014.\nSwim that Rock was first published as a hardcover and ebook on April 8, 2014. A paperback edition is scheduled to be released April 11, 2017 with slightly different cover art.\nThe authors embarked on a 12-day tour to promote the book shortly after its publication in 2014. They visited several towns in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, including Primiano's home of Jamestown.

At the beginning of Volume 3 of Else Ury's Nesth\u00e4kchen series, Nesth\u00e4kchen im Kinderheim, published 1915/1921 (Nesth\u00e4kchen in the Children\u2019s Sanitorium), Anne Marie Braun is ten years old. She is a lively child and a good student. Shortly before her birthday, she develops a high fever at school. She has been inadvertently infected with scarlet fever by her father, a doctor in Charlottenburg (Berlin), who has just examined children with scarlet fever. After a long recovery time in the private clinic of her father, Anne Marie is still very weak. Therefore, she is sent by her parents to recover for a year in the children's sanitorium \"Villa Daheim\" in Wittd\u00fcn on the North Sea island Amrum, which is managed by a sea captain's widow Mrs. Clarsen and her sister Lina. (The captain's ship was docked in Norddorf, an actual place. There was in Norddorf a port on the Kniepsand side, and also an island railway at that time on Amrum.) Life on the island, the landscape and manners, dress and speech, are described in detail. The North Germans in the story speak Plattdeutsch (Low German), which Ury transliterates, with a German translation of some words in parentheses. Anne Marie makes friends with the naughty boy Peter, who misbehaves again and again. The two walk together to seek wealth and swords in the mud, stray off the path, and get into a storm surge. But they find (albeit with difficulty) their way out of the dangerous situation. Anne Marie befriends a good girl, Gerda. Gerda has a bad leg due to a knee joint problem. Another counterpoint to Peter (who is a replacement for Anne Marie's wild brother Klaus in this part of the novel) is Kurt, whom she already met in Berlin in the hospital. Kurt is in a wheelchair, but manages with much patience and Anne Marie's help, to relearn how to walk.  At the end of the story the First World War breaks out. Anne Marie is now eleven years old. Head over heels the sanitorium's guests flee the island. Anne Marie's doll Gerda falls off the pier into the water. The scene has a symbolic meaning: Anne Marie's childhood is over.\n\"The context of the surrounding social setting is fascinating\u2014a snapshot of a vanished world presented with charming, black-and-white period illustrations. Ury\u2019s narrative tone is amusingly sardonic at times\u2014affectionate but assessing, as it aims to appeal to both children and their parents. Her portraits of the various adults that Annemarie encounters are refreshingly textured; they\u2019re not the one-dimensional authority figures that were more typical of children\u2019s books of the time. The story also handles Annemarie\u2019s shifting emotions, from feeling forlorn to gradually coming to like many people at Wittd\u00fcn, in a lively, often charming way. It\u2019s easy to see why this series might have been so popular with German families nearly a century ago.\" Kirkus Reviews\nThis volume is the most revised of the Nesth\u00e4kchen books. In the original, Anne Marie's school year goes by the old count: in the eighth grade she advances to the seventh. In later editions, it is her third year and she advances to her  fourth year. In the 1921 edition Anne Marie's friend Gerda was from Breslau, the capital of Lower Silesia. After 1945 Gerda was from Munich, capital of Bavaria. In the original \"Princess Heinrich\" (that is, Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine, 1866\u20131953, wife of Prince Heinrich, brother of Kaiser Wilhelm II) visited the island and the children's sanitorium. In later editions Princess Heinrich became the young queen of Denmark. \nA final chapter, \u201cWar Time,\u201d added after 1945 to maintain continuity of the series after volume 4 was dropped, was a politically correct abridgement of the original version of Volume 4, Nesth\u00e4kchen and the World War. The further course of the First World War is reduced to, \"However, the terrible war had ended a short time later.\"  Anne Marie's girlfriend Vera, who appears in Volume 4, is introduced in the new chapter with a few words. Vera's oppressive history, a chilling example of relational aggression that is left out, is not only one of the most important and most instructive episodes in Anne Marie's life, but also one of Ury's major literary achievements  (see Nesth\u00e4kchen and the World War). By 1996 the publisher had dispensed with the new chapter \"War Time,\" and the story ends, as it did in 1921, with Annemarie's return to her home in Berlin.\nThe Nesth\u00e4kchen books represent a German literary genre, the Backfischroman, a girls' novel that"

Jonathan Troy (1954) was Edward Abbey's first published novel, as detailed in James M. Cahalan's biography of Abbey. Only 5,000 copies were printed and almost immediately after it was released the author wanted to disown the work. He asked that it never be published again, and it has not been, making it very rare and the only one of his eight novels that many Edward Abbey fans have not read.\nWhen a fan once asked where they could find a copy of the novel, Abbey is reported to have told them \"I don't know where you can find one, but if you do, burn it.\" Copies of the book offered for sale online start at $1,300 and go up to $7,500.\nAbbey's disgust with the novel was immediate. According to James M. Cahalan's biography, Edward Abbey, A Life, he could barely get through the galleys before the book was published. He said it seemed \"even worse than I had thought,\" too \"juvenile, naive, succeeded in almost nothing. Too much empty rhetoric, not enough meat and bone. Not convincing. All the obvious faults of the beginner.\"\nIn 1984 Abbey was quoted by William Plummer in \"Edward Abbey's Desert Solecisms\" as saying that Jonathan Troy \"was a disgusting novel, fortunately long out of print. ... It's about the agonies of growing up in a small town: pimples and masturbation. There's a Faulkner chapter, an entire chapter in one sentence ... There's a Thomas Wolfe wind-through-the-trees-outside-the-farmhouse chapter, a Joyce chapter, and of course there are newspaper clips all through the thing, like in Dos Passos's Nineteen Nineteen.\"\nThis is the only one of Abbey's eight novels that was set entirely east of the Mississippi River and away from his beloved deserts of the Southwestern United States. He does spend a good portion of The Fool's Progress in West Virginia, but it starts in Tucson and then follows a road trip to its climax.\nIn high school Abbey kept a journal and often used the moniker Jonathan Troy to refer to himself. While no one has claimed that the book is in any way an autobiographical account, it was not well received by people who had known Abbey during his senior year of high school.  The contempt Jonathan shows for the residents of his home town was a hard blow to people Abbey knew in high school, a fact that may have had something to do with Abbey's later regret at having published this book.\nStill, as with his later novels, the book contains more fiction than fact. For example, in the book, Jonathan lives alone with his one-eyed father. In real life, both of Abbey's parents were living and his father had two perfectly good eyes.\nAccording to the back of the book jacket, Abbey began writing Jonathan Troy as a creative writing assignment at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque under the sponsorship of Professor C.V. Wicker. After receiving his B.A. degree in 1951, Abbey spent a year at the University of Edinburgh. It was there that the greater part of Jonathan Troy was completed.\nJonathan Troy \u2013 High school senior and 19-year-old who longs to leave this small town behind and get to the desert.

It was adapted into the 1951 film of the  same name.\nThe novel was made into a film in 1951: The African Queen, starring Humphrey Bogart as Charlie Allnutt and Katharine Hepburn as Rose Sayer. Allnutt is changed to a Canadian in the film to explain Bogart's accent. The church is changed to Methodist from Anglican - though the paper which Allnut delivers to the missionaries in the first scene records the elevation of a college friend of the missionaries to being a bishop, which makes no sense given that the Methodist Church in England had (and has) no bishops. There are significant changes to the plot after the sinking of the African Queen.\nIn 1977, a one-hour made for television film called The African Queen aired on CBS.

All the obvious faults of the beginner.\"\nIn 1984 Abbey was quoted by William Plummer in \"Edward Abbey's Desert Solecisms\" as saying that Jonathan Troy \"was a disgusting novel, fortunately long out of print. ... It's about the agonies of growing up in a small town: pimples and masturbation. There's a Faulkner chapter, an entire chapter in one sentence ... There's a Thomas Wolfe wind-through-the-trees-outside-the-farmhouse chapter, a Joyce chapter, and of course there are newspaper clips all through the thing, like in Dos Passos's Nineteen Nineteen.\"\nThis is the only one of Abbey's eight novels that was set entirely east of the Mississippi River and away from his beloved deserts of the Southwestern United States. He does spend a good portion of The Fool's Progress in West Virginia, but it starts in Tucson and then follows a road trip to its climax.\nIn high school Abbey kept a journal and often used the moniker Jonathan Troy to refer to himself. While no one has claimed that the book is in any way an autobiographical account, it was not well received by people who had known Abbey during his senior year of high school.  The contempt Jonathan shows for the residents of his home town was a hard blow to people Abbey knew in high school, a fact that may have had something to do with Abbey's later regret at having published this book.\nStill, as with his later novels, the book contains more fiction than fact. For example, in the book, Jonathan lives alone with his one-eyed father. In real life, both of Abbey's parents were living and his father had two perfectly good eyes.\nAccording to the back of the book jacket, Abbey began writing Jonathan Troy as a creative writing assignment at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque under the sponsorship of Professor C.V. Wicker. After receiving his B.A. degree in 1951, Abbey spent a year at the University of Edinburgh. It was there that the greater part of Jonathan Troy was completed.\nJonathan Troy \u2013 High school senior and 19-year-old who longs to leave this small town behind and get to the desert. He's very rude to nearly everyone he meets, especially his father.\nNathaniel Troy \u2013 A union organizer for Industrial Workers of the World and a Communist. He wears a patch over his left eye to hide the empty eye socket. He lives under constant threats to his well-being.\nLafilia \"Leafy\" Hollister \u2013 The new girl in town who Jonathan falls in love with. She's the only woman in the book Jonathan shows any real respect to.\nEtheline Glyson \u2013 Jonathan's girlfriend at the start of the story. He's in love with her body but believes she has nothing going on inside her mind.\nPhillip Feathersmith \u2013 Jonathan's teacher and director of the school play. He appears to be gay (at least Jonathan thinks so). He is constantly trying to help Jonathan mend his relationship with his father.\nLeibert B. Pitch \u2013 Another teacher who is usually hanging around Feathersmith and Jonathan. While Feathersmith usually defends Nathaniel Troy, Pitch is against it. \"He doesn't care about anything. And I like him,\" Jonathan thinks.\nDominic \"Fatgut\" Panetelli \u2013 A co-conspirator of Jonathan's and a pathological liar. The two of them engage in petty crimes. Fatgut, so named because he's overweight, constantly lies to Jonathan about how great his life is, but when challenged makes up excuses why he can't back up any of his statements.\nCaptain Billy T. Greene \u2013 Chief of the local Salvation Army Band who tries to warn Nathaniel Troy that his activities will likely get him into trouble.

The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle is a picaresque novel by the Scottish author Tobias Smollett, first published in 1751 and revised and published again in 1758. It tells the story of an egotistical man who experiences luck and misfortunes in the height of 18th-century European society.\nGeorge Orwell, writing in the Tribune in 1944, said regarding the novels Roderick Random and Peregrine Pickle:\n\"Peregrine devotes himself for months at a time to the elaborate and horribly cruel practical jokes in which the eighteenth century delighted. When, for instance, an unfortunate English painter is thrown into the Bastille for some trifling offence and is about to be released, Peregrine and his friends, playing on his ignorance of the language, let him think he has been sentenced to be broken on a wheel. A little later they tell him that his punishment has been commuted to castration. Why are these petty rogueries worth reading about? In the first place because they are funny. Secondly, by simply ruling out 'good' motives and showing no respect whatever for human dignity, Smollett often attains a truthfulness that more serious novelists have missed.\"\nGeorge P. Upton published the Letters of Peregrine Pickle in the Chicago Tribune from 1866 to 1869 as weekly letters and then in book forms.\nBeaman, Evelyn Armstrong, \"Dickens' relationship to Tobias Smollett\".

An Infamous Army completes the sequence begun with These Old Shades, (although there is an inconsistency in the time line, with These Old Shades set in 1755, Devil's Cub set 25 years later, with only 35 years until the setting of An Infamous Army, during which time there is supposed to be two grown generations) and is also a sequel to Regency Buck."

Doctor Dido is a historical novel by the British writer F. L. Lucas. First published in 1938, it was his third novel (not including the novella The Wild Tulip, 1932). With much local and antiquarian detail, it tells the story of Samuel Plampin, Doctor of Divinity at Cambridge and Vicar of St Peter's Babraham, who in 1792 brings to the vicarage as his housekeeper a young Frenchwoman he finds in Cambridge, a destitute refugee from The Terror.\nThe novel was written in the shadow of the coming war (see F. L. Lucas, Appeasement). In his 1938 Journal Lucas described it as \"filled, between the lines, with all our hopes and fears for present and future, and dedicated, with growing misgivings for that future, 'To the Enduring Friendship of England and France'.\" Its depiction of the Napoleonic war-lust gripping France in the early 19th century foreshadows that of Hitler's Germany: \nSuddenly all his self-centred pain lost itself once more in an infinite pity ... for the whole of this human race so mad to heap sorrows of its own seeking on the sorrows nothing can avoid.\nThe policy of Appeasement, which Lucas deplored, colours other passages: \"To the English, she reflected, clear-headedness is indecent \u2013 one's mind's must always be properly clothed in a chaste modicum of cloud... For the present she decided after all to shut her eyes, English-fashion, and drift.\" For Lucas's attitude to 18th Century France, see C\u00e9cile (1930), Background.\nLucas's Journal reveals that the death of Shelagh Clutton-Brock (see F. L. Lucas, Personal life) was much in his mind as he was writing Docto Dido, his sense of sorrow and loss probably colouring his account of Plampin's sorrow for the lost Sophie.\nDoctor Dido is the familiar story of the middle-aged bachelor who falls in love with a woman much younger than himself, and pays for much bliss with much unhappiness. It explores \"The dreadful fatality of passion, its inhuman indifference, once its tide has turned, to all that the most devoted adoration can ever do to turn it back again\". It is, in addition, a satire on University life, contrasting the parochialism of Cambridge with the world-shaking events on the Continent, the malice of the Combination-Room with the kindliness of individuals. It disapproves of the monasticism imposed on dons by the ban on married Fellows: \n\u2014\"Good God, Pellew, without assistance I don't believe you would know a woman from an isosceles triangle.\"\n\u2014\"I would not go quite so far as that. I know something of isosceles triangles.\"\nLike the earlier C\u00e9cile (1930) and the later English Agent (1969), Doctor Dido traces the tension between 18th-century rationalism and, in varying forms, Romantic unreason. Samuel Plampin is a man of the Age of Reason who has outlived his era and feels alienated by the new world. Too late, he realises that he, the satirical historian of \"Enthusiasm\", has himself been guilty of Romantic excess. Lucas's hostility to religion is another undercurrent in the novel, as it was in C\u00e9cile and in the novella The Woman Clothed with the Sun (1937). When Plampin adduces Mr Paley's watchmaker analogy to try to convince Sophie, she crushes him with the reply: \"Mon ami, if as he says a watch implies a watchmaker, then a crime implies a criminal... Either abandon all reasoning for ever, or admit that God is meaner than yourself \u2013 you who would never will a single ant an instant's pain.\"\nThe novel had mixed reviews. \"The book wears altogether too studied an air,\" noted The Times Literary Supplement\u00a0; \"it carries a miscellaneous load of literary learning with a jocular lightness that seems rather forced and all too soon becomes monotonous. Mr Lucas may claim complete realism for his study of heavily academic manners, but the fact remains that realism of this sort makes for fatiguing reading.\" \"Doctor Dido has its longueurs,\" admitted another reviewer. \"Its brilliant scenes of Cambridge university life at the end of the eighteenth century are too cruel.\" Forrest Reid in The Spectator disagreed: \"It has far too much vitality to be depressing,\" he wrote, \"and for the reader at least, if not for Dr Plampin, there is the consolation of humour, wit, and irony.\" Several reviewers noted the novel's emotive appeal. \"The futility and loneliness which overwhelm the returned Dr Plampin,\" noted Desmond Shawe-Taylor in the New Statesman, \"are so touchingly conveyed that we find ourselves at last really concerned for this author of A Natural History of Enthusiasm who had been unable to buttress his own heart against the unreasonable tides of passion.\" \"It deserves to be read and appreciated,\" stated The Cornhill. \"Dr Plampin and Sophie will not readily fade from the reader's remembrance.\" Appraising Doctor Dido in The Cambridge Review, D.

Maigret is notified through Interpol that Peter the Lett, an international fraudster and leader of the notorious Baltic Gang, is travelling to Paris. Furnished only with a description he and a squad from the Police Judiciaire plan to intercept him at the Gare du Nord. However, after seeing a man who matches the description Maigret is called to a carriage of the train to find a body, also matching the description he has.\nTracking the first man to a hotel he is identified as Oswald Oppenheim, a businessman in town to meet an American, Mortimer Levington and his wife.\nMeanwhile, forensic examination of the body leads Maigret to the sea-side town of Fecamp, and to the family of Norwegian sea-captain, Olaf Swaan, another man who matches Peter's description. While staking out the house, he follows another, identical, man, an itinerant Russian, later named as Fyodor Yurevich. Maigret follows him back to Paris, to a flop-house in the Marais district where he is found to live with a prostitute, Anna Gorskin.\nSo who is Peter? A vagrant, a seaman, a businessman, a corpse? Is he Russian, Norwegian, American or Latvian? Maigret's persistence is needed to unravel the mystery and track down the real Peter.\nIn this story, we are introduced to aspects of M's detective method. Simenon tells us that, like any other policeman, Maigret \u201cworked with the amazing tools that men like Bertillon, Reiss and Locard have given the police;  anthropometry, the principle of the trace and so on\u201d. But that beyond that he sought \u201cthe crack in the wall\u201d where the tiniest flaw in a man's camouflage is allowed to slip, giving Maigret a firm grasp on his real nature (p 38).\nLater Simenon describes the moment when Peter's character \u201ccracked wide open\u201d; having observed that Peter was not merely playing a role, but \u201cliving quite different lives in alternation\u201d, Maigret caught, in a bar-room mirror \u201ca quiver in Pietr's lips, and an almost imperceptible contraction of his nostrils\u201d. At that moment Maigret saw \u201cnow the guest of the Majestic, now Anna Gorskin's tormented lover\u201d (p94-96).\nSimenon recalled when asked about the conception of his character, that he was sitting on his boat and imagined \"a large, powerfully built gentleman I thought would make a passable inspector. As the day wore on I added other features; a pipe, a bowler hat, a thick overcoat with a velvet collar, and, as it was cold and damp, I put a cast-iron stove in his office\".\nThe book has been translated three times into English: In 1933, by Anthony Abbott as The Strange Case of Peter the Lett; in 1963 by Daphne Woodward as Maigret and the Enigmatic Lett; and in 2014 by David Bellos as Pietr the Latvian.\nThe story has been adapted for television three times: In English in 1963 (with Rupert Davies in the main role); in Dutch in 1967 (Jan Teulings); and in French in 1972 (Jean Richard).\nLe Monde's 100 Books of the Century\nSimenon, tr.

Ever since her childhood Constance Langton has felt out of place. She never had a proper mother, as Constance's mom preferred to obsess over the death of Constance's infant sister Alma, to the point where this drove her to suicide many years later. To make matters worse, Constance seems to have the ability to see horrible visions of future deaths, which greatly unnerves her. In 1889 Constance discovers that she has inherited Wraxford Hall, a run down and supposedly haunted mansion in Suffolk. Despite warnings by the Wraxford family lawyer that the house has led to the death and disappearances of several Wraxfords - and that living there is not a good idea, Constance ends up drawn to the house, something that might spell her doom.\nThe Seance received positive reviews from Tor.com and The Independent, the latter of which compared the book to the works of Wilkie Collins and Arthur Conan Doyle, writing that both authors were \"fascinated by the disputed borderland between the claims of the paranormal and the techniques of Victorian science. In the hands of a lesser writer, these elements might have seemed stagey and trite. But Harwood reinvests them with novelty and makes them genuinely spooky.\" The Telegraph praised Harwood's writing, especially his \"understanding of how two young women, Constance and Eleanor, are at the mercy of a society in which they have to fight for an economic stake, continually facing the anxieties of poverty and social banishment.\"\nAurealis Award for best horror novel (2008, won)\n\"aurealis awards, previous years' results\" (PDF).
