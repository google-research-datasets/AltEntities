It was released in July 2008 as the album's lead single and quickly gained success. It sold nearly 6,000 downloads in the first week, and became 2008's highest-debuting Christian track at the time. It soon placed at No.\u00a01 on Christian radio charts, and held the position for multiple consecutive weeks. At the end of 2008, it was the second most-played song of the year on Christian contemporary hit radio.\nThe song is about wanting to see the world as God would, and having a desire to view people with more compassion. \"Give Me Your Eyes\" was written by Heath and songwriter Jason Ingram, and was generally well received by critics. The song received two GMA Dove Awards in April 2009, including the Song of the Year title. It was also Grammy Award-nominated in the Best Gospel Song category for 2009.\nThe song's meaning originated with a discussion between Brandon Heath and friend and songwriter Jason Ingram. \"We had a conversation over Chinese food that we wished we could have God's perspective on things\", Heath said. \"If we did have His perspective, we'd wish we could have it for long periods of time, rather than just for a few seconds. That was the beginning.\" He soon began to pen a song about the idea, co-writing \"Give Me Your Eyes\" with Ingram. Prior to recording What If We, Heath had written 40 possible tracks for the album, and although the song was not his top favorite, he noted that \"Give Me Your Eyes\" was \"one of the first that really stuck out.\"\nThe song's genre is represented by pop, and includes acoustic and mild hip hop influences. It is a mid-tempo song based upon a strummed acoustic guitar, background piano, and occasional strings. The song's continuous clap-sounding beat was described as a \"hip-hop shuffle\", drawing comparisons to Christian musician Mat Kearney.\nLyrically, the song is about a desire to view people as God would, and was \"inspired by people-watching at an airport\". Heath has said, \"[it's] a song about my own convictions for wanting to see the world with compassionate eyes.\"\n\"Give Me Your Eyes\" was digitally released as the lead single from What If We on July 23, 2008. Upon its release, the single was commercially successful and soon began to place on Christian radio charts. It made nearly 6,000 downloads in the first week, which was the highest-debuting Christian track of 2008 at the time. By the second week, another 6,700 copies were sold. It placed at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Christian Songs chart beginning in September, and spent an end total of 14 consecutive weeks at the top by December. It also held the No. 1 position on the Radio & Records (R&R) Christian CHR chart for 13 consecutive weeks from the last week of August through the start of December. For the week of November 1, 2008, \"Give Me Your Eyes\" debuted on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart at No. 22, which is equivalent to placing at No. 122 on the Hot 100.\nBy mid-September, it had sold 70,000 digital downloads. The song placed at No. 1 on the iTunes top Christian songs chart and held the position from July through February for seven consecutive months, receiving 100,000 downloads on iTunes by late October. It ended 2008 as the second most-played song on R&R's Christian CHR format; the song also placed at No. 9 for the year's top-played Christian AC songs.\nThis song was also by the appearances by the compilation album WOW Hits 2009 and Now That's What I Call Faith.\nThe song was generally received well by critics. The New York Times highlighted Heath's Grammy Award-nominated What If We album as one of the best Grammy nominees in Christian music that year, saying; \"Mr. Heath's sense of wonder is firmly intact \u2013 'Give Me Your Eyes,' which is nominated for best gospel song, is a breezy statement of humble devotion.\" The song was featured on USA Today's top ten \"pick of the week\" playlist in the beginning of March 2009; the magazine's editor and music critic Brian Mansfield said, \"Grammy and Dove Award nominations are attracting a second look for Heath's song about seeing life's big picture.\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Matthew Watson said of Heath's future music efforts: \"it could be really outstanding if he sticks to more upbeat songs like 'Give Me Your Eyes'.\"\nThe song was Grammy Award-nominated in the Best Gospel Song category for the 51st Grammy Awards of 2009. It received two awards at the 40th GMA Dove Awards in April 2009: Song of the Year and Pop/Contemporary Song of the Year. On January 30, 2010, the song won an Emmy for the Nashville Rescue"

The song was recorded by the former and featured as a track on the album This Is It (2009), which accompanies the 2009 concert documentary Michael Jackson's This Is It.\nIt was premiered worldwide on Jackson's official website on October 12, 2009, four months after his death on June 25, 2009. Although Sony Music Entertainment referred to the song as a \"new single\" during its promotion, it was later confirmed that the song would only be sent for airplay, and not be available to buy as a single release. According to Anka, the song was recorded in 1983 and intended to be a duet between him and Jackson on Anka's  Walk a Fine Line album under the title \"I Never Heard\", but these plans fell through. Thereafter, Sa-Fire recorded the track for her album, I Wasn't Born Yesterday (1991). The duet version of the song was featured in Anka's 2013 Duets album.

Jackson's version, styled as a pop ballad, was his first song to chart on Billboard's Hot Adult Contemporary Chart in over seventeen years. The song was generally well received by critics and enjoyed good chart performances globally. It became a top twenty hit on charts in Japan and Spain, and peaked at number 18 on both Billboard's US Adult Contemporary and R&B/Hip-Hop song charts. In 2011, it received a Grammy Award nomination.

The song was intended to be added as an album track on Anka's 1983 duets album Walk a Fine Line that he was in the process of recording at the time.\nSoon after the alleged theft in the '80s, Anka threatened to take legal action if the recordings were not returned. Jackson's version of \"This Is It\" was reportedly found in a box of tapes with only Jackson's voice and a piano accompaniment, the song was described as having been a \"bare-bone\" recording. Jackson subsequently returned the tapes, although Anka insisted that Jackson had made a copy of the recordings of \"I Never Heard\" and retitled the track with his voice to \"This Is It.\" In 1990, Anka allowed the Puerto Rican R&B recording artist Sa-Fire to record \"This Is It\", which she did under the original title \"I Never Heard\" on her second studio album I Wasn't Born Yesterday in 1991.\nOn September 13, 2009, it was reported that a \"secret Michael Jackson single\" was being produced to promote the film Michael Jackson's This Is It, so that the song's release would coincide with the release of  the film.

The song was released on July 16, 2013, as the lead single from the album through Hollywood Records after being premiered on July 12, 2013. The song was written by Zendaya in collaboration with Mick Schultz, Tiffany Fred and Paul Phamous while the song's production was handled by Mick Schultz. Musically, \"Replay\" is an electro-R&B song.\nCritical response to \"Replay\" was positive; many critics praised its composition. The song reached number forty on the United States' Billboard Hot 100 chart. It has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song also made appearances on charts in Australia, where it reached the top ten, New Zealand, Canada, and Flanders (Belgium).\nAn accompanying video was recorded on June 1, 2013, in Los Angeles and directed by Colin Tilley; the music video premiered on Disney Channel on August 15, 2013, and later that day on Zendaya's new Vevo channel. It was inspired by Janet Jackson's \"The Pleasure Principle\" video, referencing the clip in several scenes. To further promote the song, Zendaya performed it on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and included it as part of her setlist for her debut tour.\nAfter starting her career as an actress, acting in shows including Shake It Up, she began featuring on soundtracks releasing the singles \"Watch Me\" and \"Something to Dance For\". On August 8, 2012, Zendaya announced she had signed a record deal with Hollywood Records, via her official Twitter account she commented on the signing writing; \"epic moment in my life...it's official!!! HOLLYWOOD RECORDS!!!\", the comment also included pictures of herself with the label executives signing a contract. In May 2013, it was reported that Zendaya's debut album would be released in the fall of 2013 and the album's lead single would be released in June.\n\"Replay\" has a length of three minutes and twenty-nine seconds. Musically, \"Replay\" is an electro-R&B song. Zendaya's vocals in the song expands two octaves from the low note of E\u2083 to the high note of E\u2085.\nThe song was composed by Tiffany Fred and Paul \"Phamous\" Shelton. \"It's a very special song. I think it's very different and unexpected for me because I feel like it's on a higher level production wise,\" Zendaya said in an interview with Radio Disney: \"It's one of those songs that's creating its own lane or genre. I don't think it's pop, I don't think it's hip hop, I don't think it's R&B. I don't even know where you would consider it because it kind of mixes that pop sound beat with a very R&B kind of melody\". Zendaya describes the single as not basic pop music, but having an urban twist to it.\nZendaya released a preview of \"Replay\" on July 12, 2013, and released it to Radio Disney the next day. On July 16, 2013, she officially released \"Replay\" on iTunes. In August 2013, Zendaya released two previews of the music video. On September 19, 2013, Zendaya made her first national performance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, in which she sang the album's lead single. On October 29, 2013, Zendaya was the New Artist of the Month on The Today Show, where she performed an acoustic version of \"Replay\". On November 29, 2013, she performed \"Replay\" on BET's 106 & Park. Zendaya further promoted the project by hosting events like the 106 & Park special \"106 & Prom\", in which she spoke about her upcoming music project. In early 2012, Zendaya embarked on a North American tour entitled Swag It Out Tour, to promote her debut album and the Shake It Up soundtrack. The tour started on August 5, 2012, in Oakland and finished on December 17, 2013. The tour consisted of two legs over America and Canada with a total of twenty one shows.\nSam Lansky of Idolator praised the song calling \"Replay\" a \"sick burner with a pristine pop finish\", Lanksy went on to praise the song calling it \"mature, self-assured and sexy without being overly provocative\" and compared the song to that of Usher's \"Climax\" or a Cassie mixtape track.\nMuumuse praised the song and Zendaya for the maturity, praising the production and its \"strange and drippy, full of spacey, \u201csomething more urban\" sound. He also compared \"Replay\" to the music of Cassie and JoJo.\n\"Replay\" made its debut at number 42 on the Pop Digital Songs issue dated July 26, 2013, with 12,000 digital downloads sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\nThe song"

It was released on February 6, 1988 as the fourth single from his seventh solo album, Bad (1987). Arranged with a gospel choir, the song is played in the keys of G major and A\u266d major at a tempo of 100 bpm. The vocal range is A\u266d\u2083\u2013C\u2086.\n\"Man in the Mirror\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, becoming Jackson's tenth number-one single on the chart, and was certified 3x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for Record of the Year at the 31st Grammy Awards. The song peaked at number 21 in the UK Singles Chart upon release in 1988, but in 2009, following the news of Jackson's death, the song peaked at number 2. The song was remixed for the soundtrack of Jackson's tribute tour Immortal.\nThe \"Man in the Mirror\" music video was directed, produced and edited by Don Wilson. Don and Michael Jackson developed the idea for the video. Larry Stessel who was Video Commissioner at Epic Records at the time was the Executive Producer. It features a montage of clips of starving children in Africa, Adolf Hitler, Hitler's American \"relatives\", George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party, the Ku Klux Klan, Martin Luther King Jr., the Kent State shootings, Mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi, Desmond Tutu, Mikhail Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela, Pieter Botha, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, the June Struggle in South Korea, homeless people in the U.S., baby Jessica McClure's rescue, kids in graduation, and other historical figures.\n\"Man in the Mirror\" was composed by Glen Ballard and Siedah Garrett. Jackson added background vocals from Garrett, the Winans and the Andra\u00e9 Crouch Choir. The song is said to have been one of Jackson's favorite songs. Arranged with a gospel choir, Jackson would use a gospel choir again several years later on his hit \"Will You Be There\". Siedah Garrett also sang Jackson's duet \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" in mid-1987. The song is played in the keys of G major and A\u266d major at a tempo of 100 bpm. The vocal range is E\u2083\u2013G\u266f\u2085.\nThe single sleeve for \"Man in the Mirror\" contains a dedication to Yoshiaki Ogiwara, a five-year-old boy from Takasaki, Gunma, Japan who was kidnapped and murdered in September 1987. Jackson was touring Japan at the time and dedicated concerts in Osaka and Yokohama to Yoshiaki's memory.\nWhen Ed Hogan reviewed the song, he called it \"gentle.\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times noted that this song has \"gospelly lift.\" Rolling Stone's Davitt Sigerson thought that \"Man in the Mirror\" stands among the half dozen best things Jackson has done: \"On 'Man in the Mirror,' a song he did not write, Jackson goes a step further and offers a straightforward homily of personal commitment: 'I'm starting with the man in the mirror/I'm asking him to change his ways/And no message could have been any clearer/If you wanna make the world a better place/Take a look at yourself and then make a change.'\u2009\"\nIn 2009, Josh Tyrangiel from Time named \"Man in the Mirror\" among Jackson's ten-best songs and \"one of Jackson\u2019s most powerful vocals and accessible social statements, not to mention the best-ever use of a gospel choir in a pop song.\" In 2017, ShortList's Dave Fawbert listed the song as containing \"one of the greatest key changes in music history\".\nOne of the videos is a notable departure from Jackson's other videos mainly because Jackson himself does not appear in the video (aside from a brief clip toward the end of the video in which he can be seen donning a red jacket and standing in a large crowd). Instead, it featured a montage of footage of various major news events and famous people.\nThe \"Man in the Mirror\" music video was directed, produced and edited by Don Wilson. Don and Michael Jackson developed the idea for the video. Larry Stessel who was Video Commissioner at Epic Records at the time was the Executive Producer.\nPCM Stereo music video version of this song was included on Number Ones, Michael Jackson's Vision, the Target version DVD of Bad 25, and the song's video that released on VHS in 1989.\nAn alternate live video was used as the opening song in Jackson's film Moonwalker with live audio and footage from several live performances of the song during the Bad World Tour. The first segment of Moonwalker is a live performance of \"Man in the Mirror\" during his Bad Tour in Europe and America."

The song features vocals by American singer-songwriter Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic. It was released in the United States as the second single from the album on October 9, 2010, by Cherrytree and Interscope Records. According to the group, the song regards \"flying to make those dreams happen for the one you love\". They also cited the song was inspired by themselves as \"LA Dreamers living on a dream and never knowing where it would take you\".\nThe pop-rap song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Some of them called it one of the highlights of Free Wired, \"catchy\" and noticed the keyboard chords resembled those of \"Somebody to Love\" (2010) by Justin Bieber, which led to speculation that \"Rocketeer\" copied from the track. However, both songs were produced by the Stereotypes, with the latter being the first. In the US, the song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and Mainstream Top 40 charts, respectively. It also peaked at number six on the Rhythmic chart and number nine on Hot Rap Songs. The song entered at its peak of number 14 on the UK Singles Chart and reached number 11 in Slovakia. It peaked at number four in New Zealand, ten on Japan Hot 100 and number 14 in Australia.\nDirector Marc Klasfeld shot the accompanying music video. It depicts a love story between a young couple, who will have to go their separate ways since the girl has to leave for a job in Japan. During the video, her boyfriend is seen gathering material for a \"make-shift\" jet pack to get to her after she leaves. At the end of the video, he goes \"off into the night, leaving a trail of sparks behind him\". A short film, titled \"Rocketeer (LA Dreamer Short Film)\", was also released in dedication to their hometown, along with a new version of \"Rocketeer\". Far East Movement performed the song live in various shows, such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Conan, and the Billboard Music Awards.\nA demo of \"Rocketeer\" was first recorded with vocals from Bruno Mars, which were replaced by Ryan Tedder's vocals on the final version, with the version ultimately being included on Far East Movement's album Free Wired in October 2010. The former version leaked on April 13, 2011. After the success of the lead single, \"Like a G6\", the group felt pressure to re-create it. However, instead of releasing \"another dance song\", there was a need to come up something different for showing their range as musicians. As a result, \"Rocketeer\" marked a departure from Far East Movement's usual sound.\nKev Nish, one of the members of the group, commented in an interview to Blues & Soul: \"We'd basically go in the studio and take hip hop-style drums, electronic synths, alternative-style hooks and just mash it all UP! Which in turn became the inspiration behind a track like 'Rocketeer'... And, by featuring Ryan Tedder on the song, we were then also able to cover that credible, alternative rock base.\" Far East Movement detailed the process of the song's creation; they decided to change \"the tempo and fuse a slower paced hip hop track with electro synths and an alternative style hook\". According to them, the lyrics are \"about flying to make those dreams happen for the one you love\". Moreover, the group affirmed the track was \"inspired by how we grew up in Downtown LA as LA Dreamers living on a dream and never knowing where it would take you. We wanted to paint a portrait of where we live, from where we started, to the free wired mashed up community of dreamers that make up LA.\"\n\"Rocketeer\" was written by Jae Choung, James Roh, Kevin Nishimura, and Virman Coquia, whom are collectively known as Far East Movement, with additional songwriting by Jeremy Reeves, Johnathan Yip, and Ray Romulus, whom are collectively known as the Stereotypes, as well as by Mars and Philip Lawrence, also known as the Smeezingtons. The song was produced by the Stereotypes and the Smeezingtons, while it was recorded by the former team at Short Bus Studios in North Hollywood.

It is the third track from their 1993 album Zooropa and was released in June 1993 as the album's first single. The song features a monotonous mantra of \"don't\" commands spoken by guitarist the Edge amidst a backdrop of various sound effects and samples. The noisy composition and lyrical concept for \"Numb\" were inspired by the theme of sensory overload, which had prominently been incorporated into the Zoo TV Tour. Lead singer Bono and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. provided backing vocals on the track.\n\"Numb\" originated as a discarded song from the Achtung Baby recording sessions called \"Down All the Days\". While recording Zooropa, the band transformed the song with mixing assistance from co-producer Flood, the addition of keyboards and samples by co-producer Brian Eno, and the addition of the Edge's monotone vocals. The song was released as a VHS single, featuring music videos directed by Kevin Godley and Emergency Broadcast Network, respectively, but it did not attain widespread commercial success. U2 added \"Numb\" to their live set lists after resuming their Zoo TV Tour in May 1993, but like most songs on Zooropa it has never been performed live since the end of that tour.\n\"Numb\" originated as a discarded song from the Achtung Baby sessions called \"Down All the Days\" (later released in the premium editions of Achtung Baby's 20th anniversary reissue) that was recorded with producer Daniel Lanois at Berlin's Hansa Studios. The band was not fond of the track\u2014Zooropa co-producer Flood, who was engineer for the Achtung Baby sessions, said it was \"quite a ballady song and in the end it was decided that it didn't fit\" on that record. Guitarist the Edge said, \"It almost worked,\" calling it a \"quite unhinged electronic backing track with a very traditional melody and lyrics\" sung by lead vocalist Bono.\nDuring the Zooropa sessions of February\u2013May 1993, U2 revisited the song. At Windmill Lane Studios, producer Brian Eno began working with a stereo submix of the Berlin version, containing guitar, bass, bass pedals and drums, that Flood had created. Eno added about six or seven tracks of keyboards to the submix, mostly samples and strings from a Yamaha DX7 synthesiser. Some of the samples included Arabic voices and congas. According to Flood, \"The idea of his overdubs was to make up music out of non-musical noises, like loops of pieces of dialogue and video samples.\" The Edge called Eno's additions \"fantastic\".\nThe song's biggest contribution came while the band were organizing the final running order for Zooropa. The Edge spent several hours in another studio with the mix, experimenting with ideas; eventually adding vocals in a monotone, almost rapped delivery. He said that writing the lyrics \"came very quickly\", and that he wrote so many lyrics that two verses had to be cut from the song. His vocals were recorded at Westland Studios in Dublin, where the band spent one day for the album sessions. Flood subtly added gating to his voice \"to turn the level down when he wasn't singing.\" The addition of the Edge's vocals, for the most part, completed \"Numb\".\nBono and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. provided backing vocals. Flood treated Bono's vocals with heavy reverb to complement his \"falsetto soul voice\", while Mullen provided two tracks of backing vocals, one with a falsetto and one with his natural singing voice. After the vocals were overdubbed, Flood and the Edge mixed the track at Westland Studios. The Edge described it as \"a few hours' work and a lot of editing\", but said the mixing was \"the easiest thing in the world\" Flood concurred, calling the mixing \"very straightforward\". A sample of a Walkman cassette player rewinding was accidentally recorded onto the audio tapes, but the group liked the sound and looped it throughout the song. The final mix comprised about 15 or 16 audio tracks.\n\"Numb\" runs for 4:20 (4 minutes, 20 seconds). According to Hal Leonard Corporation\u2019s sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is played in common time at a tempo of 91 beats per minute. It is an industrial rock-influenced song featuring a noisy backdrop of sampled, rhythmic noises, including \"arcade sounds\", and a Walkman rewinding. One of the samples is from Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 propaganda film Triumph of the Will of a Hitler Youth boy playing a bass drum; a video clip of the sample was used as on-screen imagery during future concerts on the band's Zoo TV Tour. The Edge sings lead vocals, providing a monotone list of \"don't\" commands: \"Don't move / Don't talk out of"

It was released on October 11, 2011, by Atlantic Records as the lead single from the soundtrack of the film, Mac & Devin Go to High School. The track was co-written by Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine, along with Cristopher Brown, Snoop Dogg, and Wiz Khalifa. Since the track samples two other songs, \"Toot It & Boot It\" (2010) and \"Sneakin' in the Back\" (1974), songwriting credits were added for a total of seventeen. Produced by the Smeezingtons, its composition began during a Smeezingtons freestyle studio session; when progress on the song stalled, Aaron Bay-Shuck considered it a potential hit and asked them to finish it. After the song was finished, Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa were added.\n\"Young, Wild & Free\" received mixed reviews from music critics, who praised it for standing out stylistically from the rest of the soundtrack with hip-hop drums and a piano hook. Some critics praised Mars's pop-nostalgia chorus and Snoop Dogg's rap but criticized Wiz Khalifa's rap performance due to being too rough. It was commercially successful, reaching the top ten in several markets (including number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and number six in France and Switzerland); it peaked at number two in New Zealand and number four in Australia. The single was certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), five times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and one-time platinum by Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ).\nIts accompanying music video, filmed in Montclair, California in October 2011, was directed by Dylan Brown. The video features Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa having fun driving karts, skateboarding and surrounded by girls at a party, interspersed with footage from Mac & Devin Go to High School. \"Young, Wild & Free\" was performed live several times, including on the 2012 VMA Tour and at Coachella 2012. It was also part of the 2015 Boys of Zummer (the American leg of Khalifa's tour with Fall Out Boy), Dogg's 2016 Puff Puff Pass Tour Part 2, and two collaborative tours by Dogg and Khalifa: the 2011 High School Tour and the 2016 High Road Summer Tour. The song was nominated for Best Rap Song at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards in 2013, and received the Most Performed Song award at the 2013 ASCAP Pop Music Awards.\nDuring an interview in the American music magazine American Songwriter, Philip Lawrence said that \"Young, Wild & Free\" was \"an after-thought\" and \"there's a lot of fun behind it\". The song began when the Smeezingtons were experimenting in the studio, a process which usually starts when they get behind the mic and singing \"until something sticks\". Although the team thought \"it was just a little something\" which would never be heard, Aaron Bay-Shuck told them the song was a \"smash\" and they had to finish it. Mars then sent the song to Snoop Dogg, who showed it to Wiz Khalifa. They liked the track, decided to record it and returned the recording to Mars (who added finishing touches). \"Young, Wild & Free\" was first released on October 11, 2011, by Rostrum and Atlantic Records in various countries via digital download. A clean version of the song was released in various countries on October 21, 2011. On December 4, 2011, the single was liberated digitally in the United Kingdom and on February 3, 2012. It was released with its accompanying music video in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in a CD single.\n\"Young, Wild & Free\" is a pop-rap song, composed in the key of D major with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Their voice ranges from a low of B2 to a high of A4. It differs from the G-funk style of other songs by Dogg and Khalifa on the soundtrack, incorporating pop elements into the chorus. The song consists of hip-hop drums overlaid with a revolving, chilled \"twinkling\" piano hook and Mars's \"sprightly\" and \"carefree choral hook\". Its \"carefree vibes\" make the single \"the perfect soundtrack for a Friday night with friends\". Coughing is"

Lamar subsequently announced his involvement on January 4, 2018, along with the release of \"All The Stars\".\nUpon its release, Lamar announced his praise for Black Panther and its director, Ryan Coogler, writing \"the magnitude of [the] film showcases a great marriage of art and culture. I'm truly honored to contribute my knowledge of producing sound and writing music alongside Ryan and Marvel's vision.\"\n\"All The Stars\" received positive reviews from critics. Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone praised the song, calling Lamar's verse \"defiant\" and SZA's verse \"enthralling\" and \"filled with vocal turns\". However, Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork gave the song a negative review, calling it \"generic\" and \"pales in comparison to [Lamar and SZA's] recent works\". Pearce further wrote that the song is \"full of heavy-handed plotting and everyman cliches\" and is \"so nondescript that it reeks of compromise, devoid of personality or any true vision.\" Although Pearce complimented Lamar and SZA's performances and the \"slick production\", he ultimately wrote that \"'All the Stars' is uncharacteristically conservative for these two stars, all in service of a bigger picture.\"\nIn December 2018, Billboard ranked \"All The Stars\" as the 15th best song of the year.\nIn the week ending January 20, 2018, \"All The Stars\" debuted at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100. During its fifth week on the chart, it managed to rise to number 31 on the Hot 100, and in the week ending March 3, 2018, the single reached number seven on the Hot 100. It is Lamar's second top ten hit on the chart in 2018, following his collaboration with The Weeknd on \"Pray for Me\", which reached number seven in early February. It also became SZA's second top ten hit on the chart following her collaboration with Maroon 5 on the hit single \"What Lovers Do\". On the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, \"All The Stars\" debuted at number 19 and stayed in the top 20 for three weeks. In its fifth week, it rose to number five on the chart.\nWorldwide, the song peaked at number one in Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and Slovakia. The song reached the top ten in Australia, Canada, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\nThe music video for the song was filmed in January 2018 and released to Lamar's Vevo channel on YouTube on February 6, 2018. It was directed by Dave Meyers and the Little Homies. As of April 2021, the video has over 290 million views.\nThe video features themes and images of Afrocentrism and Afrofuturism, referencing the visual language of the film. The beginning of the video references to the Middle Passage, with appearances of Fulani hats, La Sape, Pantsula, Kufi caps, traditional African masks, and Kandake at the end. The video also features a sequence where Lamar walks alongside several panthers referencing the Black Panther soundtrack album.\nIn February 2018, British-Liberian artist Lina Iris Viktor claimed that images of her 24-karat gold patterned artwork were used in the music video without her permission.\n\nCredits adapted from"

The song features vocals by American singer-songwriter Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic. It was released in the United States as the second single from the album on October 9, 2010, by Cherrytree and Interscope Records. According to the group, the song regards \"flying to make those dreams happen for the one you love\". They also cited the song was inspired by themselves as \"LA Dreamers living on a dream and never knowing where it would take you\".\nThe pop-rap song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Some of them called it one of the highlights of Free Wired, \"catchy\" and noticed the keyboard chords resembled those of \"Somebody to Love\" (2010) by Justin Bieber, which led to speculation that \"Rocketeer\" copied from the track. However, both songs were produced by the Stereotypes, with the latter being the first. In the US, the song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and Mainstream Top 40 charts, respectively. It also peaked at number six on the Rhythmic chart and number nine on Hot Rap Songs. The song entered at its peak of number 14 on the UK Singles Chart and reached number 11 in Slovakia. It peaked at number four in New Zealand, ten on Japan Hot 100 and number 14 in Australia.\nDirector Marc Klasfeld shot the accompanying music video. It depicts a love story between a young couple, who will have to go their separate ways since the girl has to leave for a job in Japan. During the video, her boyfriend is seen gathering material for a \"make-shift\" jet pack to get to her after she leaves. At the end of the video, he goes \"off into the night, leaving a trail of sparks behind him\". A short film, titled \"Rocketeer (LA Dreamer Short Film)\", was also released in dedication to their hometown, along with a new version of \"Rocketeer\". Far East Movement performed the song live in various shows, such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Conan, and the Billboard Music Awards.\nA demo of \"Rocketeer\" was first recorded with vocals from Bruno Mars, which were replaced by Ryan Tedder's vocals on the final version, with the version ultimately being included on Far East Movement's album Free Wired in October 2010. The former version leaked on April 13, 2011. After the success of the lead single, \"Like a G6\", the group felt pressure to re-create it. However, instead of releasing \"another dance song\", there was a need to come up something different for showing their range as musicians. As a result, \"Rocketeer\" marked a departure from Far East Movement's usual sound.\nKev Nish, one of the members of the group, commented in an interview to Blues & Soul: \"We'd basically go in the studio and take hip hop-style drums, electronic synths, alternative-style hooks and just mash it all UP! Which in turn became the inspiration behind a track like 'Rocketeer'... And, by featuring Ryan Tedder on the song, we were then also able to cover that credible, alternative rock base.\" Far East Movement detailed the process of the song's creation; they decided to change \"the tempo and fuse a slower paced hip hop track with electro synths and an alternative style hook\". According to them, the lyrics are \"about flying to make those dreams happen for the one you love\". Moreover, the group affirmed the track was \"inspired by how we grew up in Downtown LA as LA Dreamers living on a dream and never knowing where it would take you. We wanted to paint a portrait of where we live, from where we started, to the free wired mashed up community of dreamers that make up LA.\"\n\"Rocketeer\" was written by Jae Choung, James Roh, Kevin Nishimura, and Virman Coquia, whom are collectively known as Far East Movement, with additional songwriting by Jeremy Reeves, Johnathan Yip, and Ray Romulus, whom are collectively known as the Stereotypes, as well as by Mars and Philip Lawrence, also known as the Smeezingtons.

The song was written by T.I., James Scheffer and David Siegel and produced by Jim Jonsin. \"Whatever You Like\" served as the third single from Paper Trail in the United Kingdom with a release date of June 1, 2009.\nThe song peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, giving T.I. his second US number one. It topped the chart for seven non-consecutive weeks, and remained in the top 3 of the charts for over 12 non-consecutive weeks. It was also number one in New Zealand and has been certified 3\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA. It was named the 16th most successful song from 2000 to 2009, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.\n\"Whatever You Like\" was written by T.I., James Scheffer and David Siegel. The song was produced by Jim Jonsin, who produced Lil Wayne's single, \"Lollipop\". The production team worked on the track when T.I. was in the studio recording his album. The instrumentals for \"Whatever You Like\" are based on a beat of lead synthesizers and drum pattern. The song runs for 4:09 and speaks about a man who can buy a woman whatever she asks for, as well encourages the woman to ask for anything she wants. A pop-rap song, contains a sample from \"Redemption\", the opening and closing theme song from the film Rocky II. \"Whatever You Like\" is set in common time with a moderately slow tempo of 80 beats per minute, and is written in the key of D minor with a chord progression sequence of Dm-Bb-F-C.\nA second version of \"Whatever You Like\" was released in order to be suitable for radio stations. The original version of the track features T.I. saying \"Late night sex so wet, it's so tight\", while the radio version replaces these lyrics with the line \"Baby I can treat you so special, so nice\" in the hook and replacing the line \"Thing gets so wet/ it hits so right\" with \"Girl, you smell so fresh, and look so nice\" in the breakdown. The line \"Tell 'em other broke niggas be quiet\" with \"Tell 'em other broke jokers be quiet\" in the pre-hook, and the 2nd verse also censors the word \"brain\" in the line \"Brain so good/ could've sworn you went to college\" due to being a slang term for oral sex. The music video uses the edited lyrics.\n\"Whatever You Like\" received generally favorable reviews. Jared W. Dillon of Sputnikmusic called the song a \"more sophisticated take\" on Lil Wayne's \"Lollipop\". Ian Cohen of Pitchfork Media noted that the song contained virtually no rapping while praising the synth-driven beat. Blender magazine ranked the song number 14 their Top 144 Songs of 2008 and number 18 on MTV's Commercially Released Hip-Hop Singles.\n\"Whatever You Like\" debuted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100. In its third week, it achieved the biggest leap to number one in Billboard Hot 100 chart history when it jumped 70 positions, from number 71 to the top of the chart, breaking the record previously held by Maroon 5's \"Makes Me Wonder\", which jumped 64 to number one. It became T.I.'s first solo Hot 100 number one of his career and his second overall following the Justin Timberlake song \"My Love\" where T.I. was a featured artist. The song's jump can be largely attributed to huge first week digital sales of 205,000, debuting at number one on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs chart. The song held the number one position on the Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks, before being replaced by Pink's \"So What.\" The following week the song knocked off \"So What\" to return to number one on the Hot 100, marking its fourth week overall at the top of the chart. It remained there for another week, marking its 5th week overall. The next week T.I. replaced himself at number one with the follow-up single \"Live Your Life\" which hadn't been done since Usher in 2004 with the first and second singles off his album (Yeah! and Burn). After spending two weeks at number two on the Hot 100, \"Whatever You Like\" again topped the chart by knocking off \"Womanizer\" by Britney Spears, marking its 6th non-consecutive week at number one on the Hot 100. This was the first time a song returned to number one on the chart after the artist's follow up single had already spent time at number one (\"Live Your Life\" having already spent a week at number one). It is also only the third song to ever have three separate runs at number one on the Hot 100, following Chic's \"Le Freak\" in 1979 and Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\" earlier in 2008. The song retained the number"

Unlike his two prior breakthrough singles which were produced by Labrinth, the track instead features production by iSHi. It was released in September 2010 through Parlophone, digitally on the iTunes Store. It serves as the third official single from his debut album Disc-Overy. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Tinie Tempah's second number-one single in the United Kingdom. The song was released as Tempah's debut U.S. single and peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The track also marks Tinie's first top 10 hit on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40.\n\"Written in the Stars\" was used by Major League Baseball for their commercials relating to the 2011 postseason. It was also chosen by WWE as its theme song for WrestleMania XXVII. Recently, it was used as the introduction to the eighth season of the South Asian Softball League. Since the 2011\u201312 season, it has been used as the theme song for Sky Sports' coverage of Premier League football. Samples of \"Written in the Stars\" can be heard in promos used for the USA Network sports-drama Necessary Roughness. The song was chosen as Miss USA 2011 Evening Gown Competition's background music. The New York Giants used the song as their entrance song in Super Bowl XLVI on 5 February 2012. It was also used in the closing ceremony of the London Olympic Games in August 2012. In May 2016, Tempah performed the song live in Wembley Stadium before the FA Cup final.\n\"Written in the Stars\" was written by \"iSHi\", Mughal, Tempah, Turner and Charlie Bernardo and produced by iSHi and James Perolls. Tinie Tempah first revealed the song on 17 June 2010 performing it live on Sony Ericsson's Pocket TV along with \"Frisky\". Tempah said \"Written in the Stars it is a real passionate track about the sort of struggle that I've had to face. You know I just really feel it as something to perform at festivals as well so I thought I might as well get my practice and start warming up now.\"\nThe song was released on 27 September 2010, followed by Disc-Overy on 4 October 2010. \u00a8Written in The Stars\u00a8 is written in the key of A minor\nRobert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a very positive review: \n Tempah makes abundantly clear on single number three that success wasn't handed to him on a platinum dinnerware set marked 'Doulton'. Au contraire, it was an exhausting journey of \"believing and praying\" in a dream that, for a time, \"wasn't going nowhere\" \u2013 and with his ear-snagging rhymes cloaked in a stadium-sized chorus courtesy of US newbie Eric Turner, we're all going to hear about it whether we want to or not. Oh Tinie, we'll never doubt your work hard, play hard mentality again. .\nThe official music video was directed by Alex Herron and was released on YouTube by Parlophone on 13 August 2010, along with a 43-second trailer of the video three days before. The video, shot in New York City, features Tinie Tempah standing and rapping on the roof while Eric Turner is sitting on the piano in a white room playing the chorus. The narrative scenes see a young boy whose life is shaped by the fact he and his mother are subjected to a financially insecure life and he is regularly bullied by his peers and how he is consumed with his book. After an interview with Virgin Media, the rapper claimed the boy 'not to be his younger self in the tennis courts' \u2013 he was trying to portray the life of a city boy. It made its US debut on 1 February 2011.\nOn 13 September 2010, \"Written in the Stars\" debuted on the New Zealand Singles Chart at number 22, beating \"Pass Out\", which peaked at number 33 on the chart in March 2010. It later peaked at number 16. The single also managed to chart in Switzerland, where it debuted at number 71 on 26 September 2010, Tempah's first single to make an impact in the country. On 3 October 2010, the track charted at No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart and UK R&B Chart, beating \"Just the Way You Are\" by Bruno Mars and \"Let the Sun Shine\" by Labrinth, making \"Written in the Stars\" Tinie Tempah's second number 1 in the UK after \"Pass Out\". \"Written in the Stars\" sold over 115,000 copies in its first week alone, which at that point of the year was a first week figure surpassed only by \"California Gurls\" by Katy Perry featuring Snoop Dogg (124,000) and the charity single \"Everybody Hurts\" by Helping Haiti (over 450,000).

On an interview with Billboard, David Guetta said: \"I am so proud of what Nicki did on this record because we know her for those crazy raps but the other record that we have, she is singing like\u2014oh man.

It was released in April 1989 as the lead single from his first solo album, Full Moon Fever. The song was co-written by Petty and Jeff Lynne, also his writing partner for the album. It reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Album Rock Tracks chart for five weeks, starting the album's road to multi-platinum status.\nPetty recalled the recording of this song to Mojo magazine: \"At the session George Harrison sang and played the guitar. I had a terrible cold that day, and George went to the store and bought a ginger root, boiled it and had me stick my head in the pot to get the ginger steam to open up my sinuses, and then I ran in and did the take.\"\nA message of defiance against unnamed forces of difficulty and possibly oppression, the lyric is set against a mid-tempo beat:\nWell I know what's right, I got just one life\n\nin a world that keeps on pushin' me around\n\nbut I'll stand my ground, and I won't back down\nDue to its themes, the song was played often on American radio following the September 11 attacks.  Petty and the Heartbreakers played a quiet but resolute version of the song at the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon following the 2001 attacks.\nIn the 2007 documentary Runnin' Down a Dream, Petty said that he felt some initial hesitation about releasing the song, given its clear and unabashed message.\nIn January 2015, it was revealed that an agreement had been reached whereby Petty and Jeff Lynne would be credited as co-writers of Sam Smith's song \"Stay with Me\" and receive 12.5% of its royalties. Petty's publishing company had contacted Smith's publisher after noticing a likeness between \"Stay with Me\" and \"I Won't Back Down\". Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith plagiarized him, saying \"All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times you catch it before it gets out the studio door but in this case it got by. Sam's people were very understanding of our predicament and we easily came to an agreement\". Smith claimed not to have heard \"I Won't Back Down\" before writing \"Stay with Me\", but acknowledged the similarity after listening to the song, calling it \"a complete coincidence\". Petty and Lynne were not eligible for a Grammy Award (\"Stay with Me\" was nominated for three awards at the 57th annual ceremony, winning two of them) as the Recording Academy considered \"Stay with Me\" to have been interpolated from \"I Won't Back Down\" by Smith, James Napier, and William Phillips, the writers of \"Stay with Me\"; Petty and Lynne were instead given certificates to honor their participation in the work, as is usual for writers of sampled or interpolated work.\nTom Petty \u2013 lead vocals and backing vocals, acoustic guitar\nMike Campbell \u2013 slide guitar\nGeorge Harrison \u2013 acoustic guitar, backing vocals\nJeff Lynne \u2013 bass, backing vocals\nHowie Epstein \u2013 backing vocals\nPhil Jones \u2013 Linn LM-1, drums\nRingo Starr \u2013 Linn LM-1, drums in video\n\n\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush used \"I Won't Back Down\" at campaign events during the 2000 presidential campaign but was compelled to stop using the song after receiving a cease and desist letter from Petty's publisher. Petty then went on to perform the song at Al Gore's home after Gore conceded the election to President Bush. Jim Webb used the song for his successful bid for one of Virginia's U.S. Senate seats in 2006, as did Hillary Clinton during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign.  The song was also used at campaign events for Congressman Ron Paul of Texas during the 2008 Republican presidential primary campaign, as well as for events for his Campaign for Liberty. The song was also played at an event for Republican Connecticut gubernatorial nominee, Tom Foley. The song was also played at the 2012 Democratic National Convention after a speech delivered by President Bill Clinton, in which President Barack Obama came out on stage to salute him.\nIn June 2020, Petty's family issued a cease and desist letter to President Donald Trump's campaign for its use of \"I Won't Back Down\" at Trump's rally in Tulsa on June 20, 2020. The letter stated: \"Trump was in no way authorized to use this song to further a campaign that leaves too many Americans and common sense behind. Both the late Tom Petty and his family firmly stand against racism and discrimination of any kind. Tom Petty would never want a song of his used for a campaign of hate. He liked to bring people"

It was released as the album's third single on 5 September 2014. The song features the vocals of English singer John Newman and is included on the deluxe edition of Newman's second studio album, Revolve. Newman's brother James Newman assisted the artists in writing the song, with Harris serving as the producer.\nThe song received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its production and Newman's vocals. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, giving Harris his seventh UK number-one single (and third consecutive) and Newman his third.\nJohn Newman initially approached Calvin Harris via Twitter about collaborating on a song he had worked on. Newman sent a demo with his vocals and a few chords and Harris built the music around it. Newman wrote all the lyrics.\nThe single and its artwork were announced on Twitter on 8 June 2014. However, a different artwork cover was uploaded onto the iTunes Store as a replacement. \"Blame\" was originally scheduled for release on 25 August, but was delayed until 7 September.\nIn August and September 2014, Harris released fifteen-second previews of the track on his Instagram account. John Newman commented on the song: \"It will live up to the hype that's been built. I'm very excited about it, I think it's the next step up in my career.\" The song is written in the key of C minor, at a tempo of 128 beats per minute. Newman's vocal range spans from B\u266d\u2083 to  B\u266d\u2085.\nThe song received positive reviews from music critics. Robbie Daw of Idolator praised the song saying: \"'Blame' somehow feels fuller and more rounded-out, structurally, than much of [Harris'] other output. Call it a new era for the Scottish producer/DJ.\" MTV Australia described the song as \"hot\" and \"sure to have the crowd singing loud and proud\". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner gave the song a four star rating out of five, commenting: \"Luckily for Calvin, everything he touches these days seems to turn more golden than his glowing tan. Guest vocalist John Newman soulfully insists on the surging bridge, before it bursts into one of Calvin's infectious four-to-the-floor choruses. It barely shifts away from the formula that's enabled him to achieve 1 billion Spotify streams, but when it's proving itself that effective, why resign the Midas Touch?\"\nWe Got This Covered gave a positive review, noting that it was \"a bit slower and more down tempo than most of his usual stuff\" and said \"John Newman's soulful vocals go down smoothly as they layer a very catchy melody that soon breaks out into a full-on dance floor hit. Admittedly, it doesn't grab you quite like Summer did, but it's still a great song and one that will surely do very well.\" Music and Lyrics gave a more nuanced review, writing the song \"hasn't honestly hit as hard as 'Summer' did on the first listen, but I'll definitely label it as a 'grower'. Not really feeling John's verses, but he really shines in the let's-go-to-church hook. 'Blame' doesn't have the best Calvin Harris EDM beat I've heard to date, but I can still bop to it.\"\n\"Blame\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number one with 70,312 copies sold in its first week, becoming Harris's seventh UK number one and Newman's third. In the United States, the song debuted at number thirty-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated 27 September 2014, peaking at number nineteen on 15 November 2014. The single topped the charts in Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, while charting within the top five in Austria, Germany, Ireland and Italy, and the top ten in Australia, Denmark, France, New Zealand and Spain.\nThe music video was directed by Emil Nava and released on 12 September 2014. It was filmed in Los Angeles and London in August 2014. The video begins with both Harris and Newman in separate places in their appropriate houses where they are both on the bed. Newman is watching some models who are seen on a film projector. Meanwhile, the models decided to go to a nightclub where one girl gets drunk while other models split where they fall into a sink, beer cooler, puddle and finally a tub. The video ends with the models ending up in a river where they are freezing and it shows the sky with the sun in the background.\nReleased on 25 September 2015.

It was written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and was produced by the singer with William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was released as the fifth and final single from the album on March 2, 1999 by Maverick Records and Warner Bros. Records. An EDM track on which Madonna experiments with different musical genres, \"Nothing Really Matters\" includes ambient music and electronic noise frequencies that were added by De Vries. Lyrically, the recording delves on the singer's first daughter Lourdes Leon, having also themes of selfishness, affection, and motherhood.\nThe song was critically appreciated for its lyrical content and composition, and was declared by reviewers as one of Madonna's most personal efforts; however, some critics felt it was tepid and lacklustre compared to other tracks from Ray of Light. In the United States, the song remains Madonna's lowest entry on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 93. Its low chart peak was due to lack of airplay and the delay in releasing it in CD single formats, to which the singer's fans protested against Warner Bros. The song became her 23rd number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart, reaching the top spot in Hungary and Spain, and entering the top ten in countries including Canada, Finland, Iceland, Italy, New Zealand, Scotland and the United Kingdom.\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Swedish director Johan Renck, and was released on February 13, 1999. Inspired by Arthur Golden's 1997 novel Memoirs of a Geisha, the video portrays Madonna as a geisha, dancing in a small room. The red kimono worn by her in the video was designed by French fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier. It was worn by the singer during her performance of the song at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. \"Nothing Really Matters\" is cited as one of Madonna's most underrated singles to date. The costume and music video has been cited by journalist and academics as one of Madonna's most iconic and best re-inventions.\n\"Nothing Really Matters\" was written by Madonna and American producer and songwriter Patrick Leonard, and was produced by herself alongside British producers William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was inspired by Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon, whom she gave birth to in 1996. These events inspired a period of introspection for the singer. \"That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before,\" she said to Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including \"Nothing Really Matters\". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to her, which included a demo version of \"Nothing Really Matters\"'s music. According to Madonna, she had been a fan of Orbit's work for a long time and was pleased with the demo version, which he started to work on.\nDe Vries, who had worked on the demo, asked Orbit to help produce the song, and was enlisted. According to Madonna: Like an Icon writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had originally composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution \"off-putting\", to which the latter confessed, \"On all the collaborations I'd left a lot of space for him, but for this I wanted to put something on the table and say, 'This is what I think'\". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a \"vision on how the song should be finished\". Orbit did not like the addition since it sounded to him that the \"DAT's broken\". De Vries defended his contribution saying that it was supposed to be \"like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune.\" Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly left it on.

It was released as the lead single in the United Kingdom on 7 November 2010. The song is the first to feature Robbie Williams since his return to the band in July 2010, and features both Williams and Gary Barlow on lead vocals.\nThe song received acclaim from critics, who praised its anthemic sound and Williams' vocals. It peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and was a hit internationally, including reaching No. 1 in Portugal.\nThe song was placed on the Radio 1 A-Playlist for a number of weeks after its first play on radio in early October. The band appeared on X Factor result show 6 to perform \"The Flood\" live for the first time on 14 November, it was also the first time they had performed as a five piece in 15 years. They also performed it on Children in Need and closed the show with number-one single \"Never Forget\".

The Daily Telegraph again praised the single stating \"The Flood is a stirring us-against-the-world pop anthem that blends the best of Williams' rabble rousing instincts with Gary Barlow's smooth songwriting.\" Orange agreed with this view, stating that \"when it comes to perfect pop, they're still the masters of their game\".\nThe Flood was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award in 2012 for best work and most performed song.\nThe single achieved commercial success in the United Kingdom and across Europe upon release, charting in more than 20 countries to date.\n\"The Flood\" debuted in Denmark at number 7 on 22 October 2010 before moving up to 4. It remained in the Danish Singles Chart for a total of 20 weeks and was certified Gold by the IFPI.

Written and composed by the group members in collaboration with Matt Rowe and Richard \"Biff\" Stannard during the group's first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album, Spice, released in November 1996. The song was written, composed, and recorded very quickly but the result was considered lacklustre by their label and was sent to be mixed by Dave Way. The group was not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, this time by Mark \"Spike\" Stent.\n\"Wannabe\" is an uptempo dance-pop song which features Mel B and Geri Halliwell rapping. The lyrics, which address the value of female friendship over the heterosexual bond, became an iconic symbol of female empowerment and the most emblematic song of the group's Girl Power philosophy. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the song won for Best British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards and for British Single of the Year at the 1997 Brit Awards.\n\"Wannabe\" was heavily promoted by the group. Its music video, directed by Johan Camitz, became a big success on the British cable network The Box, which sparked press interest in the group. Subsequently, the song had intensive radio airplay across the United Kingdom, while the group performed it on television programmes and started doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines.\nResponding to the wave of public interest in the group, Virgin released the song as the group's debut single in the United Kingdom in July 1996, well ahead of the planned release date of the Spice album. \"Wannabe\" topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and has received a double Platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The song was released in the United States in January 1997, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was the group's only number-one single in that country. By the end of 1996, \"Wannabe\" had topped the charts in 22 nations, and by March 1997 this number had climbed to 37. \"Wannabe\" became the best-selling single by a girl group in the world, with 1,385,211 and 2,910,000 copies sold in United Kingdom (by 2017) and United States (by 2014), respectively, and over 7 million copies worldwide by the end of 1997. In a 2014 study, it was found to be the most easily recognisable pop song of the last 60 years. An EP titled Wannabe 25 was released in 2021 to mark the single's 25th anniversary.\nIn March 1994, father-and-son team Bob and Chris Herbert, together with financer Chic Murphy, working under the business name of Heart Management, placed an advertisement in The Stage, which asked the question: \"Are you street smart, extrovert, ambitious, and able to sing and dance?\" After receiving hundreds of replies, the management had narrowed their search to a group of five girls: Victoria Adams, Melanie Brown, Melanie Chisholm, Geri Halliwell, and Michelle Stephenson.

Stannard recalls:\nMore than anything, they just made me laugh. I couldn't believe I'd walked into this situation.

It was released on 15 January 2008 as the second single from her second North American studio album of the same title (2008). Bedingfield co-wrote the song together with American songwriter Danielle Brisebois and American musician and songwriter John Shanks; Shanks also produced the track as well as performing on most of the instruments present. Epic Records serviced the song to contemporary hit radios in the United States on 11 February 2008. It was not released in Europe until April 2011, when it was released as the lead single from her third European studio album Strip Me Away (2011).\nBedingfield noted \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" as her favourite, stating that it centers on escaping from one's troubles. It adapts dance-pop and adult contemporary styles, differing from her previous recordings. Lyrically, the song discusses escapism and finding a peaceful place in difficult situations. The message is amplified by the melancholic tone of the lyrics mixing with the exuberance displayed in Bedingfield's voice. \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" was well received by contemporary music critics; the majority of them named it as one of the album's highlights. Several critics also praised it as a bright and lively summer tune.\n\"Pocketful of Sunshine\" experienced commercial success in North America. In the United States, it peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling three million downloads and becoming her most successful single there. In Canada, it peaked at number three on Canadian Hot 100 and was certified platinum by Music Canada. It, however, did not replicate the success internationally as it charted moderately in several countries.\nThe music video for \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" premiered on 15 April 2008, and features Bedingfield escaping from a stressful situation and dancing on a roof with other background dancers, also portraying scenes of other people escaping their troubles, coming to Bedingfield for comfort. The single has been used widely in the media, being featured in movies and television series such as Easy A, Degrassi: The Next Generation and The Ugly Truth.\n\"Pocketful of Sunshine\" was written and produced by John Shanks, while additional writing was provided by Bedingfield and Danielle Brisebois. The aforementioned songwriters were also involved in performing the background vocals present on the track. Shanks, a musician as well as a writer and producer, performed several instruments that make up the song, which include the guitar, bass and keyboards. The latter instrument was also played by Charlie Judge while Wendy Melvain performed on guitar. Jeff Rothschild was the engineer behind the recording process of \"Pocketful of Sunshine\", which took place at Starstruck Studios in Nashville, Tennessee and Henson Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. He received assistance from engineers Aaron Kasdorf and Jared Robbins in recording the song. Rothschild was involved in programming the song as well as playing the drums. It was then edited through the use of Pro Tools technology by Lars Fox and mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios in Los Angeles, California. In an interview with OK! Magazine, Bedingfield the song as one of her favourites on the album, stating \"Its about going to a familiar place when you're in that situation that you want to escape from finding a peaceful place within.\"\n\"Pocketful of Sunshine\" is the second single taken from Pocketful of Sunshine (2008), a repackaged version of N.B. released in North American territories. Epic Records serviced the song to contemporary hit radios on 11 February 2008. On 29 July 2008, an extended play of \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" was released via iTunes in North American territories. The EP features remixes by StoneBridge and American disc jockey Johnny Vicious. Following the release of Strip Me in international territories in spring 2011, the song was selected to be released as the international single. \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" was released for digital download on 15 April 2011 in Germany and 22 April 2011 in France.\n\"Pocketful of Sunshine\" is a pop song that incorporates styles of dance-pop and runs for three minutes and twenty three seconds."

The song was originally released as the theme song for director James Cameron's 1991 film, Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\nBacked with \"Civil War\" from Use Your Illusion II, the single reached number 29 on the US Billboard Hot 100, number three on the UK Singles Chart, and number one in Finland and Spain. It became a top-five hit in more than ten additional countries.\n\"You Could Be Mine\" was selected to be included in the James Cameron film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Arnold Schwarzenegger had the band members over for dinner at his own home to negotiate the deal.\nThe lyric \"With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue you get nothin' done\" from the chorus appeared on the inner sleeve of Guns N' Roses' debut album Appetite for Destruction, released in 1987 (the song had already been written by then). This \"tradition\" was followed by the line \"Ain't It Fun\" on the Use Your Illusion albums released in 1991 - two years later GN'R cover of the song \"Ain't It Fun\" appeared on \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" album. The end of first verse, \"we've seen that movie too\", is a reference to Elton John' song \"I've Seen That Movie Too\", from  the album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. Slash states that the song's writing began at the first preproduction session for Appetite for Destruction.\nThe song has a one-minute drum and guitar intro. The song was played during the ending credits of Terminator 2 and was heard in the film itself in early scenes with John Connor. It also appeared in another part of the Terminator series, Terminator Salvation.\nThe song talks about band member Izzy Stradlin's failed relationship with his girlfriend.\nThe music video for the song was directed by Andy Morahan, Stan Winston and Jeffrey Abelson. A T-800 Terminator is assembled, given the appearance of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and dispatched to assassinate the band at one of their concerts. The video consists of clips from the movie, including its teaser trailer, intercut with footage of the band performing the song as the T-800 makes his way to the front of the crowd. After the song ends, he confronts the band as they leave the venue through a back door and analyzes each member individually; Izzy Stradlin is absent at this point, replaced by keyboardist Dizzy Reed. The T-800 scans W. Axl Rose last and concludes that killing the band would be a \"Waste of Ammo\". Lowering his shotgun, he gives Rose a brief smirk and walks away.\nAs the video features clips from the movie, it could not be put on the DVD Welcome to the Videos due to licensing issues. The video was also not included on any of the DVD releases of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, although it was included with a special double tape edition of the film, released on VHS in 1993.\nEarly live versions of \"You Could Be Mine\" featured Slash using a B.C. Rich Mockingbird (as in the video) instead of his usual Gibson Les Paul, due to his use of a tremolo during the solo. It was first played live at Rock in Rio II on January 20, 1991, and has been a staple ever since. The live version features amended lyrics to the line \"an I leave you lyin' on the bed' with your ass in the air\".\n7-inch single (GEFS7-19039)\n\"You Could Be Mine\" (LP version) \u2013 5:48\n\"Civil War\" (LP version) \u2013 7:38\nEuropean CD single (GED 19039)\n\"You Could Be Mine\" (LP version) \u2013 5:48\n\"Civil War\" (LP version) \u2013 7:58\nW.

It was written and produced by Puth, with additional writing from Jacob Kasher. The song was initially released by Atlantic Records as the second promotional single on May 3, 2018, and was sent to US contemporary hit radio on July 24 as the fifth single from the album.\nThe song deals with Puth's reaction to his sudden fame, specifically his insecurities and anxieties. He has identified the song as his most personal on the album. The content of the song was so personal in fact that Puth \"was almost crying while writing it because it was so overwhelming.\"\nIn an interview with Genius, Puth explained the meaning behind the song, saying: \"I was known for who I was dating more than my music. People were forgetting that I was actually a singer. And that was not good and multiple people told me that wasn't good. I worked too hard to have that reputation. So I just like a slight steer to the left and brought it back to the music. I honestly feel better mentally than I ever have in my life.\"\n\"The Way I Am\" is an upbeat pop song in which Puth addresses on his self-acceptance. Described as an \"introspective, autobiographical track\", it heavily features \"a plugging electric guitar riff\" throughout, with \"Puth's vocals syncing up to the instrumental during the verses\".\nDirected by Colin Tilley, the music video was released on July 9, 2018. It features Puth wandering from one room to another, interspersed between flashbacks of a house party that took place the night before and shots of him sitting alone on the roof of the house, as partygoers drink and dance past him in fast-motion. Throughout the video, he locks eyes with a brunette woman; they come face to face and exchange smirks as the party comes to an end. Salvatore Maicki of The Fader regarded the video as \"a nice aesthetic throwback to the late 90s\", while PopSugar's Mekishana Pierre opined that Puth's character bears a resemblance to My So-Called Life's Jordan Catalano.\nOn June 22, 2018, Puth made the first televised performance of \"The Way I Am\" at the 2018 Radio Disney Music Awards. On July 17, he performed the song during his television appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, as well as the Citi Concert Series on Today three days later.\n\nRecording and management\nPublished by Charlie Puth Music Publishing/Artist 101 Publishing Group (BMI) admin. by Warner Chappell; Rap Kingpin Music/Prescription Songs (ASCAP)\nPersonnel\nCharlie Puth \u2013 composition, production, recording\nJacob Kasher \u2013 composition\nJan Ozveren \u2013 guitar\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Voicenotes.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease as a promotional single.\n\"Charlie Puth on fame, Boyz II Men, and his new album Voicenotes\".

It was released on August 25, 2009 as the lead single from the album. The song was co-written by Emily Osment and Anthony Fagenson, and was produced by James Maxwell Collins. Lyrically, Osment stated she wanted the song to be about \"breaking out\" and that \"a lot of kids can relate to that\".\nThe song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Some have praised Osment's \"spunk\", and also make comment about how she chose not to join with Hollywood Records, like most other Disney Channel artist and instead joined Wind-Up Records (the label that is home to Creed and Evanescence). However, some call the song childish, stating that Osment tries to come across as \"fierce\", but just falls flat in the end. However, some have praised the single, calling it a magnificent start to her career. Osment herself has stated that the song is influenced by Alanis Morissette's album, Jagged Little Pill.\n\"All the Way Up\" failed to garner much attention on the music charts, but it did manage to enter the charts in a few international territories, as well as becoming a hit on Radio Disney. The music video was directed by Roman White and features Osment, along with the band and labelmates Push Play rehearsing a performance of the song in their apartment. The video shows the effects the loud music has on all of the surrounding apartments. \"All the Way Up\" was performed on Osment's first tour, the \"Clap Your Hands Tour\", as well as the American talk show, The View.\n\"All the Way Up\" was co-written by Osment, along with James Maxwell Collins and Anthony Fagenson. The song was recorded by Osment while on the set of the hit Disney show, Hannah Montana. She stated during an interview that the song was finished after nearly 3 months of working on it. The single was debuted on Radio Disney on August 25, 2009, and was released for radio airplay the following day. Originally, You Are the Only One was intended to be released as the lead single. However, Osment pushed for the release of \"All the Way Up\", and eventually her record label agreed to release it as her debut single.\n\"All the Way Up\" has an emphasis mainly on the bass and drums, but the guitar is also dominant in the song. Osment has listed Alanis Morissette as one of the main inspirations for the single, and album in general. She stated that Morissette's album Jagged Little Pill was the main influence for her musical career, and that she had incorporated themes from the album into her own. When being interviewed about the single, Osment stated\n\u201cThat song was written about a year ago and I recorded the final recording three or four months ago. I wrote it with Tony Fagenson and Max Collins.... When we first wrote it we wanted to write a song about breaking out... A lot of kids can connect with that because we all have strange habits.\nThe lyrics to \"All the Way Up\" were co-written by Osment, with all of her teenage fans in mind. It speaks of wanting to break out, and just be who you want to be. The main example of this theme is shown in the chorus of the single, when Osment sings the line, \"All the way up, all the way down. Never look back, it's time to break out!\" \"All the Way Up\" is constructed with the common verse-chorus pattern.\n\nCritical response to \"All the Way Up\" was generally mixed, with the majority of critics leaning more toward the positive side. Andrew Leahy, of allmusic, stated that \"After flirting with pop and country on her early recordings, Emily Osment underwent a rock & roll makeover for her debut EP, All the Right Wrongs.\" They also went on to state that \"Despite some fairly catchy songs, [Osment] never quite shakes [herself] free of the Disney machine: [she] embraces Auto-Tune, emphasizes overly polished production, and generally whittles away at the sharp teeth these tunes might've otherwise had. In their review of the album, absolutepunk.net stated \"All The Way Up, though upbeat, contains mundane lyrics (\u201cIts my life, it\u2019s a riot/ Come on, baby, you can\u2019t deny it\u201d), and boring pop melodies.\" They even went on to say that Oment was suffering a major identity crisis (referring to her signing with Wind-up Records instead of Hollywood Records like most Disney artist.)\nThe single did receive positive reviews as well, though. In their review of the single, sodahead.com said the song was their favorite on the album. They went on to say that the song was very \"fun\", and makes you \"wanna get up and dance!\"\n\"All the Way Up\""

Keys co-wrote and co-produced the R&B ballad with Jeff Bhasker and Salaam Remi. The song contains an interpolation of the drums from the 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" by American rock guitarist Billy Squier, who received a writing credit on \"Girl on Fire\". Released on September 4, 2012, as the lead single from the album of the same name, \"Girl on Fire\" is Keys' first release under RCA Records following the closure of J Records, after a reorganization at Sony Music Entertainment.\n\"Girl on Fire\" was inspired by Keys' giving birth to her son Egypt and marriage to husband Swizz Beatz. Keys recorded a three-track suite for the song, consisting of the main version in addition to two remixes. The first remix, titled \"Inferno\", adds two new verses from American hip hop artist Nicki Minaj, whilst the second mix titled \"Bluelight\" strips back the drums and piano leaving a sparse bass-led production and re-recorded \"smokey\" vocals. \"Girl on Fire\" opened to extremely positive reviews from critics, with many praising Keys' vocals and the song's production. Keys performed \"Girl on Fire\" for the first time at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards on September 6, 2012, where she was joined by Minaj and American gymnastics gold-medalist Gabby Douglas. The song has been certified 5x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\"Girl on Fire\" is the lead single and title track from Alicia Keys' fifth studio album, Girl on Fire (2012). Alongside the main single, Keys recorded two other versions: the Inferno Remix which features new verses from Nicki Minaj and a Bluelight Remix which strips back the vocals and production from the main single. Gerrick Kennedy from the LA Times spoke of the multiple versions of the song commenting that the main single was most likely made for pop radio, but noted that Minaj's verses on the Inferno Remix would probably get noticed more. On being able to premiere her new song at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, Keys said, \nDebuting a new song at the VMAs is definitely special. I debuted 'No One' at the VMAs\u00a0\u2014 it was the first time anyone in the world heard 'No One,' Keys said. \"It's the perfect setting. It's the right energy. It's the right vibe. People are so excited about the night of music and hearing different styles that it just goes over really well. I can't wait!\n\n\"Girl on Fire\" is a midtempo song written by Keys, Jeff Bhasker, Salaam Remi and American rock guitarist Billy Squier. Squier earns a writing credit for the inclusion of an interpolation of the drums from his 1980 song \"The Big Beat\". Composed on the key of A major, \"Girl on Fire\" uses common time and is set to a \"heavy beat\" at a tempo of 93 beats per minute. Keys' vocals range in the song over an octave from a low note of C\u266f\u2084 up to a high note of E\u2085. On the main single, Keys opens the songs with the lyrics \"She got both feet on the ground and she's burning it down. She got her head in the clouds and she's not backing down. This girl is on fire!\" Keys' lyrics centre around toasting the \"achievements of women everywhere\", particularly with the hook \"She's just a girl and she's on fire\", which according to MTV's Rob Markman is delivered with a \"calming-yet-commanding wail\". Markman also spoke of the pace of the song, describing it as \"pulsating\". LA Time's Gerrick Kennedy expanded further describing the songs components as \"a fierce battlecry over a fast-building simplistic hook\". Critics likened \"Girl on Fire\" to Keys' previous singles \"No One\" (2007) and \"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\" (2009). Throwing \"If I Ain't Got You\" (2004) into the list of comparisons, Erin Thompson from Seattle Weekly said \"Girl on Fire\" compares to previous Keys' ballads with its \"quiet, unassuming verses leading into big, empathic choruses.\"\nThe Inferno version features Nicki Minaj, who wrote and rapped two new verses on the song. Minaj's vocals were recorded at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. The inferno remix uses the same production and sample as the main single however, the first two verses of the song were described as \"understated\" by Carl Williot from Idolator, with Minaj leading the remix with a new rap verse. She raps \"Took me on the balcony, telling me to jump with her/ Yeah I'm in the ghost but I ain't doing stunts with her/ I ain't trying to be that, haters want to see"

It was the first single released from their third studio album, Hot Mess. The song was released digitally through iTunes on May 11, 2009. On May 8, 2009, \"Good Girls Go Bad\" made its radio debut on KIIS-FM with Ryan Seacrest's show.\nThe song was produced by former American Idol judge Kara DioGuardi and Kevin Rudolf.\nThe song went on to become Cobra Starship and Leighton Meester's first US hit and top 10, peaking at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified double-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, denoting over 2 million copies sold in the United States. The song received heavy airplay in Canada as well, debuting at 21 on Canada's radio airplay chart \"Canadian Hit 30\" week ending July 25, 2009. The song also debuted on Radio 1 in the UK in September 2009. The song was licensed in various media.\nSome of the official remixes also feature rapper Flo Rida.\nThe band was first offered to work with Kara DioGuardi in 2009, just as DioGuardi was becoming an American Idol judge. Vocalist Gabe Saporta explained,\nWe got offered to work with Kara right as she was becoming an American Idol judge. We didn't know who she was. She didn't know who we were. We got hooked up with her. I'm like, 'Who is this person?' She's like, 'Who's this annoying band?' But we got in the room, and it was like magic, and we wrote the song in 15 minutes. It's, like, the best song on our album.\nFifteen minutes after the creation of the hook for the song, the entire track was done. On April 27, 2009, it was announced Gossip Girl star Leighton Meester would be featured. Lead singer Gabe Saporta had wanted Meester to be featured in the song because \"it's already kind of her character in Gossip Girl, like the perfect girl with the bad streak.\" Once Meester heard \"Good Girls Go Bad\", she took an immediate liking to it. \"I thought, 'I need to get on that!' It totally is my sound too. Really fun to dance to it. Very edgy and cool\".\nCobra Starship has performed the song live with Nicole Scherzinger at 36th People's Choice Awards, and Paulina Rubio at Los Premios MTV Latinoam\u00e9rica 2009. On November 18, 2009, Leighton Meester performed the song for the first time ever at the Flagship Store of American Eagle Outfitters. On November 24, 2009, Cobra Starship, alongside Leighton Meester, performed the song for the first time ever on the OP Presents Tour at the Nokia Theatre.\n\"Good Girls Go Bad\" is in A Minor and has a vocal range between A3 through C5. The song moves at 126 bpm and is set in 4/4 time. The song maintains a sequence of A minor-C-G-F.\nBillboard reviewer Michael Menachem made comment on the song:\n\"Good Girls Go Bad has the magic to launch the members of Cobra Starship into superstardom. The New York dance-punk band powers the single from its third album, \"Hot Mess\"\u2014stylish enough for a stroll along the boardwalk and rowdy enough for the club. The guy anthem is sweetened with \"Gossip Girl\" star Leighton Meester's first musical effort, adding some sass to match Gabe Saporta's energetic vocals. The contagious hook and chorus have a lively group component where the co-eds battle in a call-and-response sing-off. With a similar appeal to No Doubt's \"Hey Baby\"\u2014minus the reggae but with an accelerated jolt of electro\u2014Cobra Starship has arrived.\"\nBill Lamb of About.com gave the song  stars commenting on its danceable sound and that it sounds good on the radio, catchy and sticks in the brain, and that Leighton Meester adds some spice but disregards the silly lyrics. Overall, he thinks that \"This is one of the most deliberately polished pop singles of the year.\"\nHowever, Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy gave the song one star out of five, saying it is \"one of the most boorish, witless singles in recent memory. The music is bad enough, its sub-GaGa production bearing all the class of a street-bought 'Romex' watch. Somehow though, the lyrics manage to take the song into a whole new world of awful, reading like a passion-free imbecile manifesto.\" According to the review, the song is likely to be the \"emotionally and artistically most bankrupt pop song\" of 2009.\nA music video for the song was shot on May 3, 2009, in New York City by director Kai Regan and it premiered on Monday, June 29, 2009. Leighton Meester shot the clip while she was in"

Mauboy told The Daily Telegraph that it \"is just about a relationship all gone wrong but also a celebration.\" Her manager David Champion said \"Inescapable\" was a dedication to Sony Music record-label executive Jay Dee Springbett, who was found dead at his Sydney apartment on 30 June 2011. Champion said, \"Jess and JD worked very closely together on making 'Inescapable' and she is devastated by his passing... His spirit lives on in the recording.\"\nJonathon Moran of The Daily Telegraph praised \"Inescapable\" for being \"catchy, sexy, [and] radio-friendly\", while a writer for 97.3 FM called it \"an absolute smash.\" For the week commencing 1 August 2011, \"Inescapable\" debuted at number 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart and number eight on the ARIA Urban Singles Chart.

The next scene shows her in front of a gold backdrop wearing a leopard-print dress with black boots; she is standing beside a man who is tied up and sings to him with a megaphone. Another scene shows Mauboy wearing a navy blue jumpsuit in a room full of mirrors. Throughout the video, Mauboy is seen with two male dancers performing choreography on a dark grey backdrop. The video ends with a dedication to Jay Dee Springbett saying, \"To Jay, We did it! This is our song. Your forever in my heart. Love Jess.\"\nA writer for 97.3 FM called the video \"vibrant, fun, [and] colourful fantastic\" and wrote that it \"showcases Jess at her best & is exactly what the Australian public love about our girl.\" A biographer of Mauboy's for The Celebrity Bureau commented, \"Her single 'Inescapable' was written by renowned US songwriter Diane Warren and went on to achieve DOUBLE PLATINUM sales and over 1 million views on YouTube/Vevo.\"\nMauboy performed \"Inescapable\" live for the first time at the 2011 ASTRA Awards on 21 July 2011.

It is a dance-pop tune which features instrumentation from both keyboard and drums, and uses a synthesized backing. Both Jessica Mauboy and Ludacris use auto-tune. Lyrically, the song is about Mauboy and her girlfriends getting ready to go to a party, and taking to the streets in their Aston Martin DB9.

There are also intercut snippets of a DB9 driving swiftly along a highway with a license plate reading \"JP Logistics\", an anonymous dancer on a bar seat with curly hair, and city scenes including neon signage. Mauboy herself can be seen wearing a fox fur and dancing at a club with some girlfriends, while holding a glass of champagne, and a bottle of alcohol is also pictured.

The dance-pop song peaked at number four in Germany and at number nine on the UK Singles Chart, while it reached number 59 on the US Billboard Hot 100. An accompanying music video was directed by Austrian film director Stefan Ruzowitzky, and depicts NSYNC  dancing inside a warehouse.\nThe song was originally pitched to the Backstreet Boys but was eventually given to NSYNC to record. It was co-written by Max Martin and Kristian Lundin in a three day period after their debut single \"I Want You Back\" started appearing on several charts in Europe. Their then-label BMG Ariola, wanted the next single to be similar but catered towards an American audience. On the day of recording \"Tearin' Up My Heart\", Lundin overslept because he recorded a previous track and slept at 7 a.m. NSYNC arrived in Stockholm the previous night to record the song for one day since they were scheduled to be in Germany the next morning. JC Chasez was the last member to perform the final takes in the studio while the other members were at the airport, as they recorded throughout the night until 6 a.m. NSYNC were excited to record the song, with Chasez stating that it would help with the band's concerts because they could start and end the show with \"two hit songs\". \"Tearin' Up My Heart\" is a dance-pop song.\nIn 2007, VH1 listed \"Tearin' Up My Heart\" as the 30th greatest song of the 1990s. In Billboard's ranking of \"The 100 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time\", the song was ranked as number five, stating that although it was similar to \"I Want You Back\", the song's \"higher energy and sharper hook\" was made \"more awe-inspiring\" than the former. In addition, they wrote that \"the harmonies provided by the rest of the group on the chorus make it about as quintessential as boy band songs come, with the rolling pop melody and funky pre-verse breakdown helping it really soar\".\nThe song has reached the top 10 in several countries, including number three in Canada, number four in Germany and Austria, number six in Sweden, and number nine in the UK. It has also charted in top 20 in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.\nIn the US, \"Tearin' Up My Heart\" charted at number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reached the top 10 on the Mainstream Top 40.\nIt has since been certified Silver in the UK.\n\nThe music video was directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky, and was filmed in Florida. It depicts NSYNC dancing inside a warehouse, playing basketball, and taking photos using a Polaroid camera. They additionally participate in a photo shoot, perform acrobatics, eat pizza, and are sprawled next to grayscale photographs. Chasez is seen performing with a guitar. Each member wears matching black and white outfits. The music video was released in Europe in February 1997, and eventually aired in the US on the debut episode of Total Request Live on September 14, 1998.\nThe video begins with several flash cuts of Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez posing in front of the camera. The remaining members join in as they perform several choreographed sequences, which constantly transition from the group wearing urban clothing and white tank tops and jackets. The first verse begins with Chasez sitting on a gym bench, while Chris Kirkpatrick is practicing on a punching bag. Both are then seen leaning on the rafters, as Timberlake is choosing clothes off a clothes rack. The group are then playing a basketball game, as they prepare for a photoshoot in front of a white backdrop. The chorus begins with the group, wearing white shirts and black pants, performing choreographed dance moves as the photographer takes various flash photos. Several members then perform stunts, such as backflips, midair splits and various parkour jumps.\nTimberlake's verse begins with the group lying on the floor covered with instant photographs, then taking selfies while eating pizza on the couch. The next scene transitions to Timberlake lying on a bed, as he stretches his arms out. The group continue to perform their choreography during the chorus, however each member individually dances in front of the camera.

It was released through Jive Records, as the second single from their second studio album No Strings Attached (2000) in the United States, and as the third single from the international edition of No Strings Attached. The song was written by Max Martin, Andreas Carlsson, and Rami Yacoub, and produced by the latter. The pop track was inspired by Joe Jackson's \"Steppin' Out\" (1982) and Rupert Holmes' \"Him\" (1980), while the lyrics are about a man attempting to persuade a woman to start a new relationship together as she recovers from a previous breakup.\n\"It's Gonna Be Me\" debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 42, where it eventually peaked at number one for two consecutive weeks. It was the only NSYNC song to peak at the number one position on the Hot 100. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) one month after its retail release. \"It's Gonna Be Me\" also peaked at number one in Canada, and charted in the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart, New Zealand, and Sweden.\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Wayne Isham, and depicts each NSYNC member as a doll inside a toy store attempting to be bought by a female customer. NSYNC performed the song at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards and 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, and in three headlining concerts. \"It's Gonna Be Me\" was popularized as an Internet meme titled \"It's Gonna Be May\", after a Tumblr image of NSYNC member Justin Timberlake was posted in 2012 with the respective caption, which gained the attention of Barack Obama and Timberlake himself.\nIn 1999, Max Martin, Andreas Carlsson, and Rami Yacoub resided in Key West, Florida, to write another single after NSYNC finished recording \"Bye Bye Bye\" (2000). Carlsson whistled the eventual melody of \"It's Gonna Be Me\", which caught Martin's attention and subsequently told him to include it in the track. On the weekend of July 17 to 18, 1999, the band recorded vocals for the song in Battery Studios during their break from performing on the NSYNC in Concert tour in New York. They also traveled to Stockholm, Sweden, where they recorded additional vocals in Cheiron Studios.\nWhile \"It's Gonna Be Me\" was written, Carlsson was inspired by Joe Jackson's \"Steppin' Out\" (1982) and Rupert Holmes' \"Him\" (1980). \"Steppin' Out\" influenced the bassline of the lyric, \"You don't want to lose it again, but I'm not like them\", while \"Him\" inspired the song's love triangle theme as well as the title lyric being influenced by the chorus. During recording, Martin consciously wanted the lyrics to be sung in a specific way, which was described by NSYNC member JC Chasez in an interview with Billboard as saying \"ET'S GONNA BAY MAY!\" instead of \"It's gonna be ME\". According to Rami, Zomba Group founder Clive Calder additionally told Justin Timberlake to over pronounce the lyric.\n\"It's Gonna Be Me\" is a pop song, with a funk and R&B influence. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, it is based on  common time, with a tempo of 82 beats per minute, while composed in the key of C minor. NSYNC's vocal range spans from the low note of F\u2084 to the high note of G\u2085, while the song is constructed in verse\u2013chorus form. Timberlake performs the lead vocals on the song, elongating the word \"me\" with a \"funkadelicized vibrato\". Carlsson compared the way Timberlake sung the note to the Backstreet Boys song \"It's Gotta Be You\" from their 1999 album Millennium, which the opening line \"baby\" was pronounced as \"Bay-bay\" instead of \"Bay-bee\". He opined that Martin's vocal style originated from his time in the Swedish band It's Alive. NSYNC altered the way each consonant and vowel was pronounced in the song in order to provide it with energy. The letter \"l\" was specifically emphasized on the word \"lose\" so that the lyric would be sung as \"You don't wanna NLUUSE\" instead of \"You don't wanna lose\".\nInstrumentation consisted of a whirring electronic drum, funk-sounding bass guitar, bright halting string instruments, and staccato piano notes. The crashing piano stabs were incorporated in order for the beat to sound"

It was released through Jive Records, as the second single from their second studio album No Strings Attached (2000) in the United States, and as the third single from the international edition of No Strings Attached. The song was written by Max Martin, Andreas Carlsson, and Rami Yacoub, and produced by the latter. The pop track was inspired by Joe Jackson's \"Steppin' Out\" (1982) and Rupert Holmes' \"Him\" (1980), while the lyrics are about a man attempting to persuade a woman to start a new relationship together as she recovers from a previous breakup.\n\"It's Gonna Be Me\" debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 42, where it eventually peaked at number one for two consecutive weeks. It was the only NSYNC song to peak at the number one position on the Hot 100. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) one month after its retail release. \"It's Gonna Be Me\" also peaked at number one in Canada, and charted in the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart, New Zealand, and Sweden.\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Wayne Isham, and depicts each NSYNC member as a doll inside a toy store attempting to be bought by a female customer. NSYNC performed the song at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards and 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, and in three headlining concerts. \"It's Gonna Be Me\" was popularized as an Internet meme titled \"It's Gonna Be May\", after a Tumblr image of NSYNC member Justin Timberlake was posted in 2012 with the respective caption, which gained the attention of Barack Obama and Timberlake himself.\nIn 1999, Max Martin, Andreas Carlsson, and Rami Yacoub resided in Key West, Florida, to write another single after NSYNC finished recording \"Bye Bye Bye\" (2000). Carlsson whistled the eventual melody of \"It's Gonna Be Me\", which caught Martin's attention and subsequently told him to include it in the track. On the weekend of July 17 to 18, 1999, the band recorded vocals for the song in Battery Studios during their break from performing on the NSYNC in Concert tour in New York. They also traveled to Stockholm, Sweden, where they recorded additional vocals in Cheiron Studios.\nWhile \"It's Gonna Be Me\" was written, Carlsson was inspired by Joe Jackson's \"Steppin' Out\" (1982) and Rupert Holmes' \"Him\" (1980). \"Steppin' Out\" influenced the bassline of the lyric, \"You don't want to lose it again, but I'm not like them\", while \"Him\" inspired the song's love triangle theme as well as the title lyric being influenced by the chorus. During recording, Martin consciously wanted the lyrics to be sung in a specific way, which was described by NSYNC member JC Chasez in an interview with Billboard as saying \"ET'S GONNA BAY MAY!\" instead of \"It's gonna be ME\". According to Rami, Zomba Group founder Clive Calder additionally told Justin Timberlake to over pronounce the lyric.\n\"It's Gonna Be Me\" is a pop song, with a funk and R&B influence. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, it is based on  common time, with a tempo of 82 beats per minute, while composed in the key of C minor. NSYNC's vocal range spans from the low note of F\u2084 to the high note of G\u2085, while the song is constructed in verse\u2013chorus form. Timberlake performs the lead vocals on the song, elongating the word \"me\" with a \"funkadelicized vibrato\". Carlsson compared the way Timberlake sung the note to the Backstreet Boys song \"It's Gotta Be You\" from their 1999 album Millennium, which the opening line \"baby\" was pronounced as \"Bay-bay\" instead of \"Bay-bee\". He opined that Martin's vocal style originated from his time in the Swedish band It's Alive. NSYNC altered the way each consonant and vowel was pronounced in the song in order to provide it with energy. The letter \"l\" was specifically emphasized on the word \"lose\" so that the lyric would be sung as \"You don't wanna NLUUSE\" instead of \"You don't wanna lose\".\nInstrumentation consisted of a whirring electronic drum, funk-sounding bass guitar, bright halting string instruments, and staccato piano notes. The crashing piano stabs were incorporated in order for the beat to sound"

Although credited to the whole band, it was largely written by their drummer Roger Taylor, and is the eighth track on the band's 1991 album Innuendo.\nThe song was released as a single in the United States on Freddie Mercury's 45th birthday, 5 September 1991, and as double A-side single in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 9 December, in the wake of Mercury's death, with the Queen track \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". The double A-side debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart and remained there for five weeks, topped the Irish Singles Chart for six weeks, and reached number 16 in Germany. The song was awarded a Brit Award for British Single of the Year in 1992. In 1999 it was included in Queen's compilation album Greatest Hits III.\nRon Hart of Rolling Stone writes, \"the conga-driven synth ballad \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" is Innuendo\u2018s most significant single, given that it was released on Mercury's 45th birthday, and that its video marked the last time his fans were able to see the singer alive, as it was filmed in May of 1991 during the final stages of his battle with AIDS. A ballad in the vein of \"Love of My Life,\" it was a song that carried a significant amount of weight given the frailty of Mercury's appearance in the black-and-white video, later compounded when unreleased colour footage from the filming emerged in Days of Our Lives.\"\nReminiscing on the past, Roger Taylor penned the song as Freddie Mercury's health was deteriorating. As a teenager Taylor had known Mercury since the late 1960s when they worked together at Kensington Market in London before the two (along with Brian May) founded Queen in 1970. The opening chorus in the song reminisces, with \"Those were the days of our lives\", while the second chorus refers to the present, \"Cos these are the days of our lives\".\nI was sitting at home in a rather reflective mood and I did know that Freddie was ill, and I think it came out of that slightly melancholic mood. I guess I was trying to put an optimistic slant on it in a way\u2014those were the days then. And these are the days of our lives\u2014Today is more important than yesterday.\n\u2014\u2009Taylor speaking to Absolute Radio in 2011.\nThe video was the last Queen video to feature Freddie Mercury in person before his death on 24 November 1991. Rudi Dolezal and Hannes Rossacher of DoRo Productions filmed the music video at studios in London on 30 May 1991.\nMercury, Roger Taylor and John Deacon were present at the shoot; Brian May was filmed later in the year and added in digitally, as he was out of the country on a promotional tour at the time of the shoot. Following rumours about Mercury's health, the video was filmed and released in black-and-white to hide the full extent of his illness.\nIn the video, Mercury wears a waistcoat with pictures of cats that was made for him by Queen costume designer Diana Moseley. With his farewell look straight at the camera as the song ends, Mercury whispers \"I still love you\", directed to his fans, which are his last words on camera. Video director Dolezal had been told beforehand to keep things speedy due to Mercury's ailing condition, but before shooting wrapped Mercury requested one more take for the last lyrics of the song: \"Those days are gone now but one thing's still true / When I look and I find I still love you\". Jordan Runtagh for People writes, \"On the last line, he summons all his strength for a final heroic pose before collapsing into himself with a soft laugh. Staring through the camera, he whispers a final \"I still love you\" before snapping his fingers, walking out of frame with a flourish\". Dolezal comments, \"In these last few seconds of that song, he gives us a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of his whole life: 'I was a big superstar, but don't take it too seriously.' And then, 'I still love you,' which is to the fans. Then he walks out of life. Even in his last moments, he planned his exit artistically. That's how he wanted it to be.\"\nThe US version of the video features animation produced by Walt Disney Studios, as Queen's North American record label, Hollywood Records, is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney"

It was released in October 1988 as their debut single and as the opening track of their album Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. The song was the first recording made by the group, although it was originally intended as a bonus track on a European single by George Harrison. When he and Jeff Lynne presented the song to Harrison's record company, the executives insisted it was too good for that purpose, a decision that resulted in the formation of the Wilburys. The song was written primarily by Harrison, although, as with all the tracks on Vol. 1, the writing credit lists all five members of the band: Harrison, Lynne, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty.\n\"Handle with Care\" was the Wilburys' most successful single. It peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, number 2 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart and number 21 on the UK Singles Chart, and was a top-five hit in Australia and New Zealand. Directed by David Leland, the video for the song was an MTV favourite in the late 1980s.\nPetty and his band the Heartbreakers often performed \"Handle with Care\" in concert. Lynne sang it with them at the Concert for George, a year after Harrison's death in November 2001. Harrison's son Dhani Harrison sung lead on the song with Jeff Lynne's ELO during their 2019 US tour.\n\"Handle with Care\" came about through Warner Bros. Records, which distributed George Harrison's Dark Horse record label, pressing Harrison for an extra track for the European release of his \"This Is Love\" single. Having arrived in Los Angeles in April 1988, Harrison discussed the request over dinner with Jeff Lynne, his co-producer on the Cloud Nine album, and Roy Orbison, whose album Mystery Girl Lynne was producing at the time. Lynne agreed to help him record the track the following day, and Harrison invited Orbison to attend the session, after Orbison had said he \"would like to come along and watch\". With no professional studios available at such short notice, Harrison phoned Bob Dylan, who agreed to let them use his garage studio in Malibu. Tom Petty, who had also been working with Lynne in Los Angeles, was invited the following day, when Harrison went to retrieve his guitar from Petty's house.\nIn a 1990 interview for the Dutch television show Countdown, Harrison said that he started writing \"Handle with Care\" \u2013 with a section in mind for Orbison to sing \u2013 on the morning of the session. Lynne helped Harrison complete the music for the song when they arrived at Dylan's house; according to Petty, Harrison had the chord sequence \"pretty much\" completed beforehand. In another contemporary interview, Harrison recalled that he had the opening line, \"Been beat-up and battered around\", but otherwise, the lyrics were the result of a group effort. Harrison asked Dylan, who had been tending a barbecue for the musicians, to \"Give us some lyrics, you famous lyricist.\" When Dylan asked for a title for the song, Harrison looked around the garage and said, \"Handle with Care\", after a label on a box.\nAll five musicians assisted in writing the song's lyrics, and sang and played acoustic guitars on the basic track. Harrison said that, having already planned Orbison's segment, he decided to include portions sung by Dylan, Lynne and Petty.\n\"Handle with Care\" was written in the key of G major. The main riff and verses feature a four-bar chord sequence with a descending bass line. The first bridge includes a G augmented chord. The time signature throughout is 4/4, played to a moderate rock beat. In music journalist Matthew Greenwald's description, the composition is \"built around a descending, folk-rock chord pattern and some ... major-key chorus movements\". He identifies the song's message as being \"about getting out from under the shell of the '60s fallout, along with a strong theme of survival\".\nThe song's structure comprises rounds containing three distinct sections: Harrison's verses, the Orbison-sung \"I'm so tired of being lonely\" bridge, and a second bridge led by Dylan. Author Ian Inglis writes that Harrison's verses reflect his having overcome hardships and challenges throughout his musical career, with the line \"Oh, the sweet smell of success!\" conveying a mix of optimism, resignation and cynicism regarding the concept of stardom. Inglis says that while the song bears \"Harrison's distinctive musical and vocal"

Harrison was inspired to write the song following the successful Concert for Bangladesh shows, which were held in New York on 1 August 1971 as a benefit for refugees from the country formerly known as East Pakistan. The lyrics reflect his disappointment that such a humanitarian aid project was necessary, given the abundance of resources available across the planet, and his belief that if all individuals were more spiritually aware, there would be no suffering in the world. Adding to Harrison's frustration while writing the song, the aid project became embroiled in financial problems, as commercial concerns delayed the release of the Concert for Bangladesh album, and government tax departments failed to embrace the goodwill inherent in the venture.\nHarrison recorded \"The Day the World Gets 'Round\" in England between October 1972 and March 1973. The recording features an orchestral arrangement by John Barham and a similarly well-regarded vocal performance from Harrison. The other contributing musicians were Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner. Reviewers have described the composition variously as a protest song, a devotional prayer, and a counterpart to John Lennon's peace anthem \"Imagine\".\nAs with all the new songs released on Living in the Material World, Harrison donated his publishing royalties from the track to the Material World Charitable Foundation, an organisation he set up to avoid the tax problems that had befallen his Bangladesh relief effort. The song typifies Harrison's ideal for a world unencumbered by national, religious or cultural delineation. In 2009, Voormann and Yusuf Islam covered \"The Day the World Gets 'Round\" and released it as a single to benefit children in war-torn Gaza.\nIn his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison describes the period following the two Concert for Bangladesh shows as \"very emotional\". The concerts took place at Madison Square Garden, New York, on 1 August 1971, as the first part of his fundraising program for the 8\u201310 million refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. The generosity of all the participants, together with the response from the general public, encouraged Harrison to feel \"very positive about certain things\". At the same time, the fact that it had fallen to musicians such as himself and concert instigator Ravi Shankar to address the issue left Harrison \"slightly enraged\", given the wealth of resources available to governments around the globe. Author Gary Tillery writes that, through his humanitarian gesture, Harrison had \"changed the perception\" of rock musicians, \"making it clear they could be good world citizens too\", while music critic Mikal Gilmore has noted of Harrison's \"cautious yet optimistic and tender\" worldview: \"[it] stood in stark contrast to the ugly dissolution of the Beatles and the defeated idealism that then characterised so much of rock & roll culture.\" The day after the Madison Square Garden concerts, Harrison began writing the song \"The Day the World Gets 'Round\", having stayed in New York to work with producer Phil Spector on the proposed live album of the event.\nHarrison found frustration in this next phase of the Bangladesh project, as the various record companies associated with the concerts' performers attempted to profit from the forthcoming release. Chief among these was the Beatles' US distributor, Capitol Records, who delayed issuing the album in the hope of negotiating a royalty rate to cover what they perceived as high distribution costs for the boxed three-record set. Harrison was resolute that Capitol should absorb the costs, just as the Beatles' Apple record label had already paid for the album's lavish packaging and full-colour booklet. All those involved with the concerts and post-production on the live album had given their services for free, in keeping with Harrison's hope that, in Tillery's words: \"Every penny of income \u2013 from the gate receipts to the profits from an album and a film \u2013 would go toward alleviating the suffering.\"\nBy early October 1971, bootleg recordings of the concerts were available in New York, potentially denying funds to the refugees. On 23 November, Harrison's exasperation with the situation saw him raging against Capitol president Bhaskar Menon during a late-night television interview with Dick Cavett, and threatening to take the album to a rival label. Menon then backed down, ceding much of the distribution rights to Columbia/CBS, whose artist Bob Dylan had made a"

Taken from a yet to be titled EP, David Aud\u00e9 produced the single. \"I'm Still Hot\" peaked at No. 1 on both the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs and Hot Dance Airplay charts. As part of its social media campaign to build awareness about life settlements, The Lifeline Program released a second version of the song featuring comedian and actress Betty White on 22 September 2011.\nAfter Luciana moved to the U.S. in late 2010, she met producer Aud\u00e9, and went to the recording studio to lay down the vocals for the track which he later produced.\nIn 2011, Luciana collaborated with White to produce the vocals and music video for the second version of \"I'm Still Hot\". The Lifeline Program released the music video on its website and on YouTube on Oct. 12, 2011. Good Morning America broadcast the world premiere of the music video live, spawning a host of national media coverage encompassing local news stations, news websites, social media networks, blogs, video logs and national entertainment news television programs.\nThe version of the song featuring White remains available for purchase on iTunes, and a portion of the proceeds of its sales benefits the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association.\nThere are two different music videos for this song.\nThe original music video was filmed throughout Los Angeles. The video starts with Luciana waking up on a bed with some men and then she has some flashbacks from the party the night before. She then walks down the street with a stereo and a microphone and starts to sing and dance. The Burgoyne Brothers directed the video.\nThe music video with White begins with White standing outside of the Los Angeles Zoo saying what a nice day she has had. Then Luciana turns up outside of the zoo in a limousine and shouts \"Oi Betty! Come and check out my hot wheels!\" The video then goes to White and Luciana in a song, dance and rapping battle. Bodybuilders and a boa constrictor serve as White's entourage as White hand-feeds the bare-chested men slices of cheesecake, an appropriation to The Golden Girls\u2014the television sitcom perhaps most responsible for establishing Betty White as a household name. Joey Sergo (also known as Joey Swoll) stars as one of the bodybuilders.\nThe video has a duration of four minutes and 29 seconds, and is available for viewing on The Lifeline Program website and on YouTube.\n\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (Original Mix) \u2013 3:06\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (Original Extended) \u2013 4:51\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (R3hab Remix) \u2013 4:07\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (Dave Aud\u00e9 Remix) \u2013 6:03\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (SuperMal Remix) \u2013 4:45\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (Revolvr & Scotty Boy Remix) \u2013 5:19\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (Ecotek & James Egbert Remix) \u2013 5:29\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (featuring Betty White) \u2013 2:33\n\nThe song made its first appearance on US Dance Charts at 43 and after a 7-week climb it topped both US Club Songs and Airplay Charts.

The song was inspired by 1980s music and is lyrically about moving on after a heartbreak. It was released on 27 March 2020 through RCA UK as the lead single off their sixth studio album, Confetti (2020). \"Break Up Song\" peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart and charted in several other countries. It has since received gold music certifications from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and from Pro-M\u00fasica Brasil (PMB).\nLittle Mix members Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall wrote \"Break Up Song\" with Frank Nobel, and producers Kamille and Goldfingers. According to Thirlwall, they wrote the song more than a year prior to its release with 1980s pop music and an element of nostalgia in mind, similar to that of their 2015 single \"Black Magic\". Edwards, Pinnock and Thirlwall composed it during a whirl of creativity where they wrote seven songs with Kamille in one day, after having only one melody from a frustrating previous session. The track's 1980s sound stemmed from a synthesiser they dabbled with in the studio.\nA different song was initially chosen as their sixth album's lead single with an accompanying music video already filmed. However, the group opted for \"Break Up Song\" at the last minute after hearing the demo again during a playback session. The demo had only one verse and main line. Edwards described it as \"very basic at the time. The beat was all over the place and it was really, really rough - but it just had something about it.\" Thirlwall recalled, \"We got that jittery feeling that we had with \"Shout Out to My Ex\" and \"Black Magic\" where it just felt special.\"\nThirlwall described the track as \"a very feel-good kind of empowerment song about going out and just forgetting about all your woes and troubles\". It was also called an \"80s-synth pop anthem\" about \"getting over the end of a relationship\".\nA Little Mix-themed filter on Instagram was made available to the group's followers to promote the track. The song was released on 27 March 2020 and on the same day a Spotify vertical video and a lyric video were both released. The latter was made by Kayleigh, a fan of the band from the Netherlands.\nLittle Mix announced the official music video for the song on 7 May 2020 on their social media, and it was released a day later at 9am BST. The music video for the song was semi-animated, as the planned video shoot for the song had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The group filmed portions of the video at home using the original concept. The animation of the video displayed felt fabric texture to depict the band. In the video, the animated part was focused on the group hosting a Good Morning Britain-style breakfast show on a television channel called LM TV. Leigh- Anne Pinnock is presented as a news reporter, while Jesy Nelson presents the weather forecast. Perrie Edwards is presented as a fitness mentor, while Jade Thirlwall tackles the latest fashion, with each of them having their own segment in their respective verses of the song. The video also includes real-life clips of the band dancing to the song while dressed in different styles of 80's clothing.\nOn 21 August 2020, Little Mix performed \"Break Up Song\" for the first time as part of the set list for their Little Mix Uncancelled concert. The song was later performed on the eighteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing in December 2020, with member Jesy Nelson absent from the performance.\nDigital download and streaming\n\"Break Up Song\" \u2013 3:20\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 acoustic\n\"Break Up Song\" (acoustic version) \u2013 3:22\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 Nathan Dawe remix\n\"Break Up Song\" (Nathan Dawe remix) \u2013 3:21\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 Steve Void remix\n\"Break Up Song\" (Steve Void remix) \u2013 2:57\nStreaming \u2013 Break Up Song \u2013 EP\n\"Break Up Song\" \u2013 3:20\n\"Break Up Song\" (acoustic version) \u2013 3:22\n\"Break Up Song\" (Nathan Dawe remix) \u2013 3:21\n\"Break Up Song\" (Steve Void remix) \u2013 2:57\nCredits adapted from Qobuz.\nJesy Nelson\u00a0\u2013 vocals\nLeigh-Anne Pinnock\u00a0\u2013 vocals, songwriting\nJade Thirlwall\u00a0\u2013 vocals, songwriting\nPerrie Edwards\u00a0\u2013 vocals, songwriting\nKamille\u00a0\u2013 production, keyboards, vocal production, bass, background vocals\nGoldfingers\u00a0\u2013 production, drums, keyboards, programming\nRaphaella Mazaheri-Asadi\u00a0\u2013 vocal production\nFrank Nobel\u00a0\u2013 drums, keyboards,"

The single was released on 18 May 2009. Written by British songwriter Scott McFarnon, it was produced by Mark Ronson, like the rest of the songs on this album. It was released on the Columbia record label.\nMerriweather said that this song \"is about the blindness of war and the absence of compassion displayed by western administrations. And Communism, specifically communism in Romania. Mainly about Vatra Dornei region.\"\nThe video for the song was shot in Brooklyn, New York and was directed by Anthony Mandler.\nThe video is made up mostly of scenes showing Merriweather and his on-screen girlfriend in a dark apartment. The video shows the emotional strain that is taking its toll on their relationship. It shows their anger and frustration with each other. Merriweather is also seen sitting alone in the corner of a dark room as images are projected over the wall behind him. The images depict bullets shooting through glass as well as fire. These scenes are interspersed with shots of Merriweather in a dark, abandoned warehouse. He is also seen walking the streets of Brooklyn. Though the overall colour palette of the video is quite dark and dreary, hints of red are used throughout the video in the clothing Merriweather wears, the lighting in one of the rooms, as well as some of the images projected on the wall.\nThe video was released on 15 April 2009 on Merriweather's YouTube account. As of 28 May 2009, this upload had received about 410,427 views and a 5-star rating from over 748 viewers.\n\"Red\" received mixed reviews from music critics:\nDigitalspy gave the song 3 out of 5 stars saying that \"Sadly this press release description of Daniel Merriweather's latest single is much like the singer himself - intriguing on paper, but lacking in excitement when you actually sample the goods\". They also said that \"but there's something rather cold and clinical about the Australian's performance. He may list Stax and Motown as influences, but the 26-year-old doesn't transfer the fire and thrills of his heroes into his own melodic flow\".\nThe Beat Review gave the song 4 out of 5 stars saying that \"It\u2019s an emotional track that catches every emotion of everybody who hears it. It\u2019s somehow about being \u201cperfect\u201d as Daniel sings, \u201cIt took something perfect, to paint it red\u201d. Along with the impressive arrangement, Daniel\u2019s soulful, raspy vocals ventures into the whole track making it one of his finest\".\nChart Blog gave the song 3 out of 5 stars saying \"I can't tell if it's the quiet, uncharismatic way he has about him or the song's melodic weak spots which is the problem - for all that the chorus is great, there's a bridge which doesn't really work - but somehow this isn't an easy song to get excited about\".\n\"Red\"\n\"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)\"\n\nThe song entered the UK Singles Chart at #5, making it his second top ten hit as the lead vocalist. It stayed at #5 for a second, third and fourth week. The song entered the Irish Singles Chart at #36, marking it the first Merriweather song, with him as a lead vocalist, to chart in the country. It eventually peaked at #9, becoming his first top ten hit on the Irish Charts. The song also became popular in Denmark, spending 16 weeks on the chart and peaking at #5.\n\n\n\n\nThe B-side song entered the UK Singles Chart at #126, without any promotion except from being the \"Red\" B-side. It was the first B-side by Merriweather to chart.\n\"Music - - Albums Release Diary\". Digital Spy. Retrieved 28 November 2009.\n\"Music - - Singles Release Diary\". Digital Spy.

Written and produced by lead vocalist Jared Leto, \"Do or Die\" explores the feeling of standing up and living one's dreams using also ironic undertones. The song is styled in electronic rock and imbued with elements of arena rock. It was serviced to mainstream radio in July 2013 in Europe, and was released as a promotional single in the United States in March 2014. A version of the song remixed by Dutch music producer Afrojack was digitally released in March 2014 and later included on the deluxe edition of Afrojack's debut studio album Forget the World (2014).\n\"Do or Die\" received positive reviews from music critics, who hailed its musical diversity and its euphoric but minimalistic nature. It charted in some nations due to digital sales from the parent album. The accompanying music video, directed by Leto, features live footage of Thirty Seconds to Mars onstage as well as stories from their fans, personally interviewed by Leto. The video garnered general acclaim from critics, who lauded its atmosphere and simplicity. The song was included in the setlist of the band's Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and the subsequent Carnivores Tour.\n\"Do or Die\" was written and produced by Jared Leto. It was engineered by Jamie Reed Schefman and mixed by Serban Ghenea. John Hanes engineered it for mixing at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The song was recorded at The International Centre for the Advancement of the Arts and Sciences of Sound in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Howie Weinberg and Dan Gerbarg at Howie Weinberg Mastering. Thirty Seconds to Mars unveiled six songs from their fourth studio album Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, including \"Do or Die\", during a preview event held at the Electric Lady Studios in New York City on March 14, 2013.\n\"Do or Die\" is an electronic rock song with influences and elements from arena rock. It opens with a female voiceover introducing the song's title in the Chinese language, after which there is an electronic introduction. This is followed by the sound of guitars, drum beats and synthesizers. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Leto voicing the line, \"I will never forget the moment\". The full-throated chorus then follows, which features heavy use of synthesizers and drums. The song includes a contribution from the band's fans, credited as the Knights of the White Shadow, who provide additional vocals recorded at the band's studio.\nIn an interview with PureVolume, Leto explained that the song is \"about standing up and living out your dreams\", but also features an ironic connotation. Markos Papadatos, in his review for Digital Journal, called it an \"upbeat\" song which \"deals with one taking their own stance on their beliefs, and living life to the fullest\". In a preview of the record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse described the song by saying that the band goes \"the synthy dance route on the track's intro before fire-alarm guitars and pummeling drums roar in and smash the Korg keyboards to bits\".\n\"Do or Die\" was released as a promotional single in Europe in July 2013 through Virgin Records. The song debuted at number 98 on the Ultratip chart of Belgium's Flemish region on August 24. The following week, it jumped to number 73 and peaked at number 40 on September 21. On August 30, 2013, it debuted at number 75 on the \u00d63 Austria Top 40. In the Czech Republic, the song entered the national airplay chart at number 91 on the week ending October 20, 2013.

It entered the UK Rock Chart at number 38. After four weeks, the song peaked at number seven on the issue dated September 28, 2013. \"Do or Die\" was used by Major League Baseball as the theme song for the 2013 Major League Baseball Postseason.\nIn March 2014, it was announced that Dutch music producer Afrojack and Thirty Seconds to Mars had collaborated on a remixed version of the song. It became commercially available for download in March 2014 and was later included on the deluxe edition of Afrojack's debut studio album Forget the World. Leto described the collaboration by saying, \"It was a lot of fun, and it's kind of our little summer song. I think it's good to do things"

Written by lead vocalist Jared Leto, who co-produced the song with Steve Lillywhite, \"City of Angels\" was inspired by Leto's experience of living in Los Angeles with his family and was influenced by the city's culture. Imbued with elements of synthrock as well as music from the 1980s, the track was cited as an example of the album's variety and experimentation. It was one of the first songs to be written for Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, but required a long period of time to record.\n\"City of Angels\" was released as a promotional single in July 2013 in the United States, and was serviced to mainstream radio in Europe in October 2013. It received general acclaim from music critics, who commended the song's composition and production. Following the release of Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, the track appeared in the lower regions of the UK Rock Chart. When released as a single, it re-entered the chart reaching number 21, peaked at number eight on the Alternative Songs in the US, and experienced moderate success in some international markets due to digital sales from the album. A piano version of the song was digitally released in July 2014.\nJared Leto directed the music video for the song, which features several personalities joining the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. The video was favorably reviewed by critics, who complimented the simplicity and cohesion with the song's message. It received the Loudwire Music Award for Best Rock Video and was nominated for Best Cinematography at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Thirty Seconds to Mars performed a piano rendition of the song at the 2014 iHeartRadio Music Awards. \"City of Angels\" was included in the setlist of the band's Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and subsequent Carnivores Tour.\n\"City of Angels\" was written by lead vocalist Jared Leto, who also produced the song with Steve Lillywhite.

Shannon Leto revealed that it was the oldest song written for the album and took a long time to make.\nWhile writing the song, Leto was influenced by the culture of Los Angeles and inspired by his relationship with it. He explained that pursuing his creative ambitions in Los Angeles had led to a \"love/hate relationship\" with the city. Leto told Interview magazine, \"the song is about people coming to the City of Angels to live their dreams and to make their dreams their reality. It's about how the other people they've met in the city have helped them\u2014you know, a group of people all kind of joining together into a community of outsiders, of mavericks, of freaks, of artists. It's about coming to a place to do something different and something special.\"\n\"City of Angels\" is a synthrock song with influences and elements from experimental music. It opens with an instrumental section and \"gently burbling\" synthesizers. It follows with the sounds of drum beats, including taiko drums, then transitions into a piano melody. After the first verse, the chorus follows, with Leto singing, \"Lost in the City of Angels / Down in the comfort of strangers / I found myself in the fire burned hills / In the land of a billion lights\". During the bridge, he ornaments his vocal lines with melodic crescendos, affirming \"I am home\". After the final chorus, the song reaches a drum-heavy climax. Emily Zemler from Billboard cited \"City of Angels\" as an example of variety and experimentation in Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. She described the song as a \"pulsating, subtler track that employs a blipping electronic beat rather than the band's usual rock backdrop\".\nIn a preview of the"

Written and produced by lead vocalist Jared Leto, \"Do or Die\" explores the feeling of standing up and living one's dreams using also ironic undertones. The song is styled in electronic rock and imbued with elements of arena rock. It was serviced to mainstream radio in July 2013 in Europe, and was released as a promotional single in the United States in March 2014. A version of the song remixed by Dutch music producer Afrojack was digitally released in March 2014 and later included on the deluxe edition of Afrojack's debut studio album Forget the World (2014).\n\"Do or Die\" received positive reviews from music critics, who hailed its musical diversity and its euphoric but minimalistic nature. It charted in some nations due to digital sales from the parent album. The accompanying music video, directed by Leto, features live footage of Thirty Seconds to Mars onstage as well as stories from their fans, personally interviewed by Leto. The video garnered general acclaim from critics, who lauded its atmosphere and simplicity. The song was included in the setlist of the band's Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and the subsequent Carnivores Tour.\n\"Do or Die\" was written and produced by Jared Leto. It was engineered by Jamie Reed Schefman and mixed by Serban Ghenea. John Hanes engineered it for mixing at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The song was recorded at The International Centre for the Advancement of the Arts and Sciences of Sound in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Howie Weinberg and Dan Gerbarg at Howie Weinberg Mastering. Thirty Seconds to Mars unveiled six songs from their fourth studio album Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, including \"Do or Die\", during a preview event held at the Electric Lady Studios in New York City on March 14, 2013.\n\"Do or Die\" is an electronic rock song with influences and elements from arena rock. It opens with a female voiceover introducing the song's title in the Chinese language, after which there is an electronic introduction. This is followed by the sound of guitars, drum beats and synthesizers. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Leto voicing the line, \"I will never forget the moment\". The full-throated chorus then follows, which features heavy use of synthesizers and drums. The song includes a contribution from the band's fans, credited as the Knights of the White Shadow, who provide additional vocals recorded at the band's studio.\nIn an interview with PureVolume, Leto explained that the song is \"about standing up and living out your dreams\", but also features an ironic connotation. Markos Papadatos, in his review for Digital Journal, called it an \"upbeat\" song which \"deals with one taking their own stance on their beliefs, and living life to the fullest\". In a preview of the record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse described the song by saying that the band goes \"the synthy dance route on the track's intro before fire-alarm guitars and pummeling drums roar in and smash the Korg keyboards to bits\".\n\"Do or Die\" was released as a promotional single in Europe in July 2013 through Virgin Records. The song debuted at number 98 on the Ultratip chart of Belgium's Flemish region on August 24. The following week, it jumped to number 73 and peaked at number 40 on September 21. On August 30, 2013, it debuted at number 75 on the \u00d63 Austria Top 40. In the Czech Republic, the song entered the national airplay chart at number 91 on the week ending October 20, 2013. In Slovakia, it debuted at number 67 on September 22, 2013 and eventually peaked at number 29 on January 26, 2014. Polydor Records released \"Do or Die\" in the United Kingdom on September 9, 2013. It entered the UK Rock Chart at number 38. After four weeks, the song peaked at number seven on the issue dated September 28, 2013. \"Do or Die\" was used by Major League Baseball as the theme song for the 2013 Major League Baseball Postseason.\nIn March 2014, it was announced that Dutch music producer Afrojack and Thirty Seconds to Mars had collaborated on a remixed version of the song. It became commercially available for download in March 2014 and was later included on the deluxe edition of Afrojack's debut studio album Forget the World. Leto described the collaboration by saying, \"It was a lot of fun, and it's kind of our little summer song. I think it's good to do things"

Keys co-wrote and co-produced the R&B ballad with Jeff Bhasker and Salaam Remi. The song contains an interpolation of the drums from the 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" by American rock guitarist Billy Squier, who received a writing credit on \"Girl on Fire\". Released on September 4, 2012, as the lead single from the album of the same name, \"Girl on Fire\" is Keys' first release under RCA Records following the closure of J Records, after a reorganization at Sony Music Entertainment.\n\"Girl on Fire\" was inspired by Keys' giving birth to her son Egypt and marriage to husband Swizz Beatz. Keys recorded a three-track suite for the song, consisting of the main version in addition to two remixes. The first remix, titled \"Inferno\", adds two new verses from American hip hop artist Nicki Minaj, whilst the second mix titled \"Bluelight\" strips back the drums and piano leaving a sparse bass-led production and re-recorded \"smokey\" vocals. \"Girl on Fire\" opened to extremely positive reviews from critics, with many praising Keys' vocals and the song's production. Keys performed \"Girl on Fire\" for the first time at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards on September 6, 2012, where she was joined by Minaj and American gymnastics gold-medalist Gabby Douglas. The song has been certified 5x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\"Girl on Fire\" is the lead single and title track from Alicia Keys' fifth studio album, Girl on Fire (2012). Alongside the main single, Keys recorded two other versions: the Inferno Remix which features new verses from Nicki Minaj and a Bluelight Remix which strips back the vocals and production from the main single. Gerrick Kennedy from the LA Times spoke of the multiple versions of the song commenting that the main single was most likely made for pop radio, but noted that Minaj's verses on the Inferno Remix would probably get noticed more. On being able to premiere her new song at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, Keys said, \nDebuting a new song at the VMAs is definitely special. I debuted 'No One' at the VMAs\u00a0\u2014 it was the first time anyone in the world heard 'No One,' Keys said. \"It's the perfect setting. It's the right energy. It's the right vibe. People are so excited about the night of music and hearing different styles that it just goes over really well. I can't wait!\n\n\"Girl on Fire\" is a midtempo song written by Keys, Jeff Bhasker, Salaam Remi and American rock guitarist Billy Squier. Squier earns a writing credit for the inclusion of an interpolation of the drums from his 1980 song \"The Big Beat\". Composed on the key of A major, \"Girl on Fire\" uses common time and is set to a \"heavy beat\" at a tempo of 93 beats per minute. Keys' vocals range in the song over an octave from a low note of C\u266f\u2084 up to a high note of E\u2085. On the main single, Keys opens the songs with the lyrics \"She got both feet on the ground and she's burning it down. She got her head in the clouds and she's not backing down. This girl is on fire!\" Keys' lyrics centre around toasting the \"achievements of women everywhere\", particularly with the hook \"She's just a girl and she's on fire\", which according to MTV's Rob Markman is delivered with a \"calming-yet-commanding wail\". Markman also spoke of the pace of the song, describing it as \"pulsating\". LA Time's Gerrick Kennedy expanded further describing the songs components as \"a fierce battlecry over a fast-building simplistic hook\". Critics likened \"Girl on Fire\" to Keys' previous singles \"No One\" (2007) and \"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\" (2009). Throwing \"If I Ain't Got You\" (2004) into the list of comparisons, Erin Thompson from Seattle Weekly said \"Girl on Fire\" compares to previous Keys' ballads with its \"quiet, unassuming verses leading into big, empathic choruses.\"\nThe Inferno version features Nicki Minaj, who wrote and rapped two new verses on the song. Minaj's vocals were recorded at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. The inferno remix uses the same production and sample as the main single however, the first two verses of the song were described as \"understated\" by Carl Williot from Idolator, with Minaj leading the remix with a new rap verse. She raps \"Took me on the balcony, telling me to jump with her/ Yeah I'm in the ghost but I ain't doing stunts with her/ I ain't trying to be that, haters want to see"

It was released digitally on June 10, 2008, as the album's first single and reached the top 30 of the US Billboard Hot 100. Outside the US, the track reached the top 20 in Hungary, Japan, and the United Kingdom.\nThe song received two Grammy Award nominations at the 2009 ceremony for Best R&B Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. The video was voted 12th on BET: Notarized Top 100 videos of 2008.\nThe song received generally positive reviews. About.com said that \"If you were one of the people wondering if Jennifer Hudson could sustain her vocal energy, power and passion on a full album like she did in the role of Effie in the movie Dreamgirls and like she also does on the album's opening song and first single, \"Spotlight,\" then wonder no more: the answer's a definite yes. \"Spotlight\" exemplifies the album as a whole: it's got a strong, independent woman singing strongly about love and relationships. In this case, the song is about a controlling lover: \"If I'm just love's prisoner, then I'm bustin' out,\" she sings.\" AllHipHop said that \"\"Spotlight\" as catchy as it is was not debut single-worthy, and a brand new artist wouldn't have been looked at twice; but because it was Jennifer (and penned by Ne-Yo) attention was paid.\". Allmusic said that \" 'Spotlight' was both promising and satisfying, nearly a dead-center bull's-eye \u2013 dramatic but not over the top, powerful but not a gratuitous fireworks display, a melancholy but striking midtempo track with a gently thumping four-four pulse.\" Digital Spy said that Hudson \"navigates the emotional complexities of 'Spotlight', on which she plays a downtrodden girlfriend\". New York Daily News said that the song's \"trendy, staccato backup vocals give the song spine. Better, the character presented by the lyrics \u2013 a put-upon woman who's finally stepping out \u2013 fits Hudson's persona as the angry queen of payback.\" Slant magazine said that \"Lead single \"Spotlight\" is a serviceable, pulsating, you-did-me-wrong jam that is, thanks to Stargate and Ne-Yo, perfectly in line with today's trends.\" The Times said the song \"is predictably mid-tempo as it tries to please all her fan bases at once.\"\nThe song's music video was directed by Chris Robinson and Hudson introduced its premiere screening on BET's 106 and Park on June 24, 2008. Ryan Gentles from the plays Madea Goes to Jail and Diary of a Mad Black Woman appears in the video as Hudson's love interest.\nHudson appears talking on her cellphone to her friend, complaining about her over-protective boyfriend. After she gets off her cellphone, she puts on a jacket and a scarf and leave her house into an alley, then entering a nightclub, dancing and having a good time until she sees her boyfriend Gentles. She then takes his hand and leads him into a white room with stripes telling him that she loves him but that he needs to realize that she is a good girl and not to worry before it is too late. Towards the end of the video, Hudson is walking down a runway with her boyfriend sitting in front of the runway. The video ends with Hudson getting off her cellphone. A bottle of Campari is prominently displayed in the video in a scene featuring Hudson and Gentles at the nightclub.\n\"Spotlight\" peaked at number twenty-four on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Hudson her first top thirty hit to date on the chart. The song also peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, spending two consecutive weeks at number one.\nOn September 21, 2008, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number fifteen on downloads alone. It is her first top twenty hit in the United Kingdom, and climbed to number eleven on September 28 despite there being no CD single release. It also peaked at number one on UK Airplay Chart. All in all the song performed better on the charts in the United Kingdom than in her native United States. In 2008, \"Spotlight\" was the biggest selling non-top ten single of the year. In 2017, following an impromptu performance on The Voice UK the song re-entered the United Kingdom charts at number 90.\nUS CD single\n\"Spotlight\" (album version) \u2013 4:10\n\"Spotlight\" (instrumental) \u2013 4:11\n\"Spotlight\" (call out hook) \u2013 0:11\n\"Spotlight\" (Remix By Jemell Moore [Google My Name]) \u2013 4:09\nGerman basic CD\n\"Spotlight\" (album version) \u2013 4:10\n\"Spotlight\" (part 2; featuring Young Jeezy) \u2013 5:07\nGerman premium CD\n\"Spotlight\" (main version) \u2013 4:10\n\"Spotlight\" (Moto Blanco club mix) \u2013 7:56\n\"Spotlight\""

And even though people may talk and say whatever they may want to say, but then no one can get in the way of this.\" Keys said that it was a song that \"just wrote itself\". It was one of the last songs written for the album.\nThe song was first heard in August 2007 after Keys included a clip of the song in a newsletter on her official website and fan club. It was released officially on September 10, 2007, and its radio premiere was on Atlanta's WVEE on August 29. Keys performed a medley of \"No One\" with George Michael's \"Freedom!

Popjustice viewed the song as \"one of [Keys'] best singles to date and possibly one of the eight best ballads of 2007\". Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote that the song \"shows the soulful chanteuse acting her age, in the best possible way\" and that Keys \"hold[s] back on the mastery of vocal craft to let cool, crisp production lead\", adding that it \"heralds her youth, while maintaining Keys' lockdown on penetrating hooks and soul-sopped production with a buoyancy that makes it a blast to sing along with.\" Anthony Venutolo of The Star-Ledger felt that on \"No One\", Keys \"attempts to offer uplift through cliches\".\nAlex Fletcher of Digital Spy gave the song four stars out of five and called it \"simplistic yet beautiful, fluttering, piano-tinkling ballad\", the lyrics of which \"expose Keys' vulnerability and current loved-up status\". David Mead of Paste commented that the song \"showcases a new depth and width to the tone of her voice, which seems to get closer to that of Aretha Franklin with each album.\" Nekesa Mumbi Moody of The Washington Post cited \"No One\" as one of the \"gems\" of the album and stated it \"recalls a Bob Marley groove\".\n\"No One\" was ranked at number three on Entertainment Weekly's recap of \"The 10 Best Songs of 2007\", while it was voted number 23 on The Village Voice's 2007 Pazz & Jop critics' poll (tied with Modest Mouse's \"Dashboard\", R.

It was written and produced by Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley and Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon, with additional writing by James Fauntleroy. \"Tunnel Vision\" was digitally released on June 14, 2013 by RCA Records as the third single from the album. It is a mid-tempo R&B song with EDM influence and instrumentation featuring Timbaland's signature ad-libs, record-scratching, heavy drums, melodic bass, orchestration and synthesizer. Its lyrics proclaim Timberlake's tunnel vision for his love interest, with several voyeuristic references.\n\"Tunnel Vision\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, most of whom praised Timbaland's production, and it was cited as The 20/20 Experience's highlight. After the album's release, the song charted in South Korea and the United States because of high digital sales. It debuted on the singles chart in South Korea at number 27, selling 6,670 digital copies in its first week. \"Tunnel Vision\" peaked at number 40 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number eight on the UK R&B Singles Chart.\nThe music video for \"Tunnel Vision\" was directed by Jonathan Craven, Simon McLoughlin and Jeff Nicholas, and premiered on July 3 on Timberlake's Vevo channel. In the seven-minute video, Timberlake and Timbaland watch nude women and dance. Critics labeled the video NSFW and compared it to the video for Robin Thicke's 2013 single, \"Blurred Lines\". Originally banned on YouTube, it was later posted with the condition that viewers disclose their age. The song was part of the set list for Timberlake's 2013 Legends of the Summer concert tour with rapper Jay-Z and his fifth solo tour, the 2013\u201315 20/20 Experience World Tour.\n\"Tunnel Vision\" was written by Justin Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley, Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon and James Fauntleroy, and produced by Timbaland, Timberlake and Harmon. Timberlake arranged and produced his vocals, which were recorded at Larabee Studios in North Hollywood, California. Other instrumentalists were Harmon on keyboards and Elliot Ives on guitar. The song was engineered by Chris Godbey (assisted by Alejandro Baima) and mixed by Jimmy Douglass, Godbey and Timberlake at Larabee Studios.\nOn June 10, 2013 Timberlake introduced the artwork for the \"Tunnel Vision\" single, a black-and-white close-up of the singer's face in the silhouette of a nude woman. Kia Macarechi of The Huffington Post found the artwork unpleasant and unusual; according to Justin Myers of the Official Charts Company, Timberlake \"seems to be playing up to his naughty nickname of Trousersnake with the cover\". Zach Dionne of New York's Vulture website called the cover \"awful boobnose single art\", committing to \"the smoky naked woman vibe\". \"Tunnel Vision\" and its radio edit were digitally released in France and Italy on June 14 on Amazon. That day, the single was also released in Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden on 7 Digital and the iTunes Store. It was released on June 17 in Norway, the following day in Spain and on June 21 in Switzerland.\n\"Tunnel Vision\" is a mid-tempo R&B song with an EDM influence. Billboard's Jason Lipshutz noted that it has an instrumentation that features \"fizzing beats abetted by the producer's [Timbaland] signature ad-libs and vocal record-scratches\", while according to Sobhi Youssef of Sputnikmusic the song is built on \"still-existing chops with a drum heavy, syncopated backbone amidst frenetically shifting bass melodies, sweeping orchestrations, and vacuous synths that all coalesce into a fuzzed out boom-bap.\" Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media called the synthesizer \"sinister\" and, according to Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson, it has Middle Eastern tones. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle called the beats and vocal loops on \"Tunnel Vision\" reminiscent of Timbaland's past work with the late American singer Aaliyah. According to Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post, its beat resembles that on 50 Cent's 2007 single \"Ayo Technology\" (also featuring Timberlake).\n\"Tunnel Vision\" features \"thrilling\" evolutions in production and arrangement complementing Timberlake's vocals, "

Darkroom and Interscope Records released it as the lead single from the Netflix drama series 13 Reasons Why's second season soundtrack. Eilish and Khalid wrote the song with Eilish's brother, Finneas O'Connell, who produced the track. The song has been described as a chamber pop ballad whose lyrics recount Eilish and Khalid trying to overcome serious depression together. The song also appears on the deluxe version of Eilish's EP Don't Smile at Me.\nUpon its release, \"Lovely\" received positive reviews from music critics. The song reached number 64 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and peaked within the top 40 in several other countries. \"Lovely\" has been awarded several certifications, including six times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The track was accompanied by a music video released on April\u00a026, 2018, depicting Eilish and Khalid walking around a glass case, interacting with each other, and trying to overcome their depression. Eilish included the track on the setlists of her 2019 When We All Fall Asleep Tour and her 2020 Where Do We Go? World Tour.\nDarkroom and Interscope Records released \"Lovely\" on April\u00a019, 2018, for digital download and streaming as the lead single for the album 13 Reasons Why: Season 2 (Music from the Original TV Series). The song was later included on the expanded edition of Eilish's debut EP Don't Smile at Me. Billie Eilish, Khalid and Finneas O'Connell wrote the track while production was handled solely by Finneas. Studio personnel, John Greenham and Rob Kinelski, handled mastering and mixing respectively. In an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1, Eilish explained the inspiration for the track's title: \"We called it that because the song was sort of really freaking depressing so then it\u2019s like oh, how lovely, just taking everything horrible like you know what this is great. I\u2019m so happy being miserable.\" A remix by American electronic dance music duo Hippie Sabotage, was released on July\u00a010, 2018, through SoundCloud. Dan Regan of Billboard praised the remix, saying it has \"fresh vocals\" and a \"trap-style beat [that] buff new dimension into the song\".\nCritical commentary described \"Lovely\" as a chamber pop-based stripped back ballad. According to sheet music published by Universal Music Publishing Group at Musicnotes.com, it is written in the key of E minor with a moderately fast tempo of 114 beats per minute; its chord progression follows a basic sequence of Cmaj7\u2013Em\u2013Bm. The track features minimalist production that consists of piano, violin strings provided by Madison Leinster, and percussion. Eilish explained about working with Khalid and how the track was created to Zane Lowe: \"One thing that I\u2019ll say is that when we wrote this song, what was cool about it was that it wasn\u2019t like we\u2019re going to the studio and going to write a hit. He just came over and we hung out. Me and my brother hung out with Khalid in our house and it was literally this is us hanging out as friends and we ended up writing a song.\"\nClaudia Willen of Insider describes \"Lovely\" as beginning with \"Khalid's voice echoing Eilish's vocals.\" The pair \"come together to harmonize in the chorus, singing about the feeling of being trapped inside of one's own mind\". The duo sings in a melancholic tone. The song becomes more dramatic as the pair move into the chorus, as Eilish sings: \"Isn't it lovely, all alone?/Heart made of glass, my mind of stone/Tear me to pieces, skin to bone/Hello, welcome home.\" Eilish and Khalid's voices sound hopeless as the song is coming to an end. \"But I know some day I'll make it out of here/Even if it takes all night or a hundred years/Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near/Wanna feel alive, outside I can fight my fear\", as backdrop piano and two chord strings accompany the lyrics.\nJon Blistein writing for Rolling Stone magazine called \"Lovely\" a \"smoldering ballad\". The Times' Raisa Bruner described the song as \"somber\" and \"haunting\", writing \"[there] [is] little to celebrate in the dark, brooding lyrics, but still 'Lovely' finds beautiful sounds in that pained place\". Mike Nied of Idolator commended the production, describing the strings as \"heartrending\" and the production \"atmospheric\". Robin Murray writing for"

The song was written by RedOne, Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, Bilal Hajji, and Achraf Jannusi, with co-writing credits from Minaj, and production was handled by RedOne, Falk and Yacoub. Despite the song not winning the poll where Minaj asked fans to pick the next single from her album, Minaj went ahead and released \"Pound the Alarm\" due to a large number of airplay requests for the song.\nMusically, \"Pound the Alarm\" is a Eurodance song that talks about having a good time and partying all night, as well as going to festivals/carnivals as the music video portrays. The song reached the top ten in Australia, Canada, Finland, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\nThe accompanying music video was shot in her native birth country, Trinidad and Tobago, and features Minaj performing at a national Trinidad and Tobago Carnival as well as dancing from locals of the country. The music video received positive reviews, many enjoying the fun atmosphere. The song was featured on Minaj's Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour. The song is included in the game Just Dance 2014. It is also one of the select songs available on the demo version.\nOn May 24, 2012, a poll was posted on Minaj's official website asking the fans to choose the next single(s). The poll is divided into three categories. The third and final category asks to choose between \"Pound the Alarm\", \"Whip It\", and \"Va Va Voom\". \"Va Va Voom\" had the most votes and won the poll. \"Whip It\" came in second and \"Pound the Alarm\" came in third. After the poll results were finalized, a fan then told Minaj; \"\u039d\u039f\u039f\u039f!! Pound The Alarm is way more energetic!!!\", where Minaj replied: \"I agree!!!! Fun2perform. But the polls don't lie do they?\".\" The song was eventually trending on Twitter for the choice of the songs. Moments later she tweeted: \"Oop. Just got word that radio 1 in the uk and nova & 2day fm in australia are runnin w/ #poundthealarm due to the amount of requests\" and later added after \"Sorry va va voomers...Looks like France has chosen #poundthealarm for the win as well barbz.\"\nMinaj confirmed on Twitter on June 6, 2012, that she chose \"Pound the Alarm\" as the next single instead of \"Va Va Voom\" owing to the number of radio requests \"Pound the Alarm\" was getting in the UK, Australia, and France. It officially impacted Australian radio on June 12, 2012, where it was the most added track of the week. It also impacted UK radio on June 15, 2012. In the United States, the song was released as the second mainstream single and fourth single overall from the album on July 17, 2012.\n\"Pound the Alarm\" is a Eurodance song produced by RedOne, Falk, and Rami. It is composed in common time in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 125 beats per minute. It moves in common time and follows a chord progression of C\u266fm\u2013G\u266fm\u2013A\u2013B, and Nicki's vocals span from B\u2083 to A\u2084. The song makes use of EDM, techno and house in its composition, while also being influenced by rave. After each chorus there is a \"frantic\" Eurodance and dubstep breakdown, and also features the sounds of alarms, which were sampled from American artist Britney Spears from her 2000 single Stronger, weaving beats, and \"seize-the-night\" lyrics.\nLyrically, it talks about having a good time and partying. However, in one of the verses, she warns her lover by saying, \"I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle\", meaning that whilst muzzles prevent dogs from barking, nobody can stop her from saying what she wants to say, as she is a 'bad bitch'. When the song received mixed reception from critics with it being too similar, RedOne, who produced both the song and \"Starships\" told MTV News that \"Pound the Alarm\" is sonically edgier. \"It's got the pop element, but it's got some hard-core elements, some dance underground elements.\" Laurence Green from MusicOMH compared the song to 2 Unlimited by saying \"The techno push of 'Pound the Alarm' comes on like [2 Unlimited] set loose in the studio [...]\". Kitty Empire from The Observer described the song as firmly a \"half-rap, half-pop\" song.\nEntertainment Weekly gave a positive review by describing the song as \"The perfect trunk rattler to blast from your"

The song was written by frontman Courtney Taylor-Taylor after seeing a woman pull up in her car to the traffic lights outside his apartment. It was released as the second single from the band's third studio album, Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia, on July 11, 2000.\nUpon its original release, it failed to reach the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 42, even after a yearlong tour. After featuring in a popular Vodafone advertisement, it was re-released on October 9, 2001, and peaked at No. 5 on the same chart.\nLead singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor said the song was inspired when he saw a woman in a car stopped at the traffic light below his apartment window and began to fantasize about a relationship with her. He said, \"My silly little brain ran amok with the dream of love and vintage motor malfunctions. It was only natural to weave it into a song on the spot.\"\nLouis Pattison of NME called the song \"the quintessential Dandy Warhols moment to date\". In 2011, Robert Webb of The Independent called it \"a defining song of the last decade\".\nThe A.V. Club noted the various influences from \"retro\" music present in the song, including how the guitar intro seems to imitate that of 'Little Bitch' by The Specials as well as 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' by the Rolling Stones.\nThe music video for the song, directed by Taylor-Taylor, has been the subject of controversy and is rarely broadcast on television during the day, since it contains full-frontal male and topless female nudity. However, when played on some music channels, these areas are pixelated.\nThe video shows the band playing in a karaoke bar (actually the Slabtown bar in Portland, Oregon, closed in 2014) while many different people mime to the lyrics of the song. This is intercut with a video accompanying the lyrics on the television screen at the bar. In this video, the scenes correspond with the lyrics. In the first verse, a man approaches a young woman who is fixing a car (a hearse, actually) with her friends. They both flirtatiously sing the lyrics to each other as a sign of attraction. The man is so attracted to the woman that he stares at her lower body and then visualizes her naked. Then the video switches to a waiter while he is serving a group of customers at a table. One of the girls in the group is attracted to the waiter and the two begin to flirt and mime the lyrics to the second verse. She visualizes him naked. It then turns out that the waiter and the mechanic who was fixing the car live in the same \"pad\". From the lyrics in the third verse, it is likely that the waiter is the mechanic's ex-boyfriend, as the man she was flirting with earlier is also with her. While the mechanic and her new love interest exchange a look, the woman from the restaurant emerges from a curtain wearing a nightgown. She then takes the waiter's hand and pulls him away. The video ends with the characters from the video miming the lyrics in the karaoke bar along with many other people including a man spinning a hula hoop around his waist.\nThe song has been featured in several movies, including The Replacements, Summer Catch, Igby Goes Down, Clockstoppers, Flushed Away, Little Nicky, Foolproof, Delirious, and Man of the Year. Among the television series it has been featured on are Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Numb3rs, Six Feet Under, Daria, Fresh Meat, and Chuck. A very obvious variation of the song is used as the opening theme song for the American version of the game show Cash Cab. The song was also featured in season 7 of Dancing with the Stars for Cody Linley and Julianne Hough's tango performance. For many years it has been the theme music for the BBC Radio phone-in show 6-0-6. It has also been featured in the PlayStation game Test Drive Le Mans in 2000.\nIn 2006, a mashup between the song and \"Horny\" by Mousse T. was released as the single \"Horny as a Dandy\". It reached No. 17 on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe song was the subject of a minor controversy in 2011 when British conservative politician Theresa May played the song as she walked from a conference speech. It was initially speculated that the track was \"Rocks\" by Primal Scream, who posted a statement on their website condemning her \"inappropriate\" use of their song, calling her a \"legalised bully\" and \"the enemy\".

It was produced by Butch Walker, and released on January 12, 2009, as the album's third single. \"Thinking of You\" deals with a break-up in which Perry does not want to move on but has no choice, and feels nostalgic of a previous lover while in a relationship with another man.\nThe song peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the album's only single to fail to reach the Top 10 in the United States, and peaked at number 27 in the United Kingdom. There are two music videos released for the song. The first was released in 2007 and features Perry in two different rooms\u2014black and white\u2014and was directed by a friend of hers. The second was the commercial release in 2009, which is set in the 1940s and features Perry playing a woman who lost her lover, a soldier (played by Matt Dallas), in battle during World War II. Perry began playing the song during gigs as early as 2006, and performed the song on all of her concert tours: the Hello Katy Tour, the California Dreams Tour, the Prismatic World Tour and Witness: The Tour. In South America, the song was included in the international soundtrack of Brazilian soap opera India, a Love Story and became very successful.\n\"Thinking of You\" was written by Perry in 2002 and produced by Butch Walker. Amateur video of Perry performing an entirely acoustic version at the Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Los Angeles as early as 2006 is available on YouTube. The single was released on January 12, 2009, in the US, and in Australia a week later.\nAccording to digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony-ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of E major and the tempo moves at 76 beats per minute. Perry's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of G\u266f\u2083 to the higher note of C\u2085. According to Perry, the lyrics of the song are about a break-up after which she doesn't want to move on but has no choice, and is thinking about her ex-boyfriend while she is with her current lover. Perry describes her former lover as \"perfection\" and feels disgusted with herself when she kisses her current boyfriend, calling him second best in comparison.\nWriting for BBC Music, Lizzie Ennever exalted her vocal performance while commenting that the song possesses \"edge\" and \"rawness\" that, according to Ennever, are characteristic of the \"real [Perry]\".

The song was released on September 9, 2011, by RCA Records as the third and final single from the album. \"Wish You Were Here\" was written by Lavigne along with the song's producers Max Martin and Shellback. According to Lavigne, the song shows her vulnerable side. Critical reception toward the song was positive, with critics praising it as a highlight on the album.\nThe accompanying music video for \"Wish You Were Here\" was directed by Dave Meyers and it premiered on September 9, 2011. Lavigne described the video as different from her previous work. Upon its release on the Internet, it received mixed to positive reviews from music critics who praised Lavigne's portrayal of emotions, and described it as dark. She further added \"Wish You Were Here\" to the set list of her tour, The Black Star Tour.\n\"Wish You Were Here\" is written by Lavigne, Max Martin, and Shellback, while produced by the latter two. It was recorded at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. In a telephone interview with The Caprice, Lavigne confirmed that the song would serve as the third and possibly last single from Goodbye Lullaby. During an interview with Artistdirect, Lavigne said that the song showed her vulnerable side.\nIn an interview with MTV News, she stated that the song is the perfect tune for anyone who's not able to be with the ones they love this holiday season. \"I\u2019m excited about 'Wish You Were Here' being the single because it's a ballad and the song kind of represents the album definitely more so than the first single,\" she told MTV News about the song, which she performed during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade last week. \"That was kind of more my older stuff and more pop rock and aggressive and a lighter subject. Goodbye Lullaby, for me, was a record that I was writing for myself.\" Lavigne also described her meeting with Martin and the work on \"Wish You Were Here\":\n\"He said some really kind things that really meant a lot to me. He worked with so many people and he's an artist, he's very sensitive. We wrote a couple really special songs together. It's kind of hard to work with someone new, and when I went in and did vocals on 'Wish You Were Here', I did my first take, and then Max stood up and was like, 'I'm so honored that you're here.' And it was a really special moment, where he understood me and I understood him. We connected and had a really great time. And it was really magic my first trip there.\"\n\"Wish You Were Here\" was described as a midtempo power ballad, while featuring soaring strings, piano and drum kits. The lyrics talk about missing someone and something we all go through in our lives.\nIn an interview with MTV News, Lavigne described the song as the most personal track on the album. \"It was more raw and stripped-down and more emotional and I wasn't holding back,\" she said of working on the album. \"[It's] sort of more song driven and the production was mainly just like a lot of acoustic guitars and loops and just all about the vocal; the vocal being clear and having an honest emotion to it. And saying that, yeah, the first two singles ['What the Hell' and 'Smile'] were more pop rock, and so now finally with this one, 'Wish You Were Here', being released, it feels right.\"\nThe song comes from a place deep inside and is very much about someone in Lavigne's life. \"I love this song. I like this song because I wrote it about missing somebody and that's something that we all go through at some point in our lives,\" she explained. \"It's just about looking back and remembering all those good times you shared with somebody, all the crazy moments. And that's life. We all experience that at some point, but it has a positive message.\"\n\"Wish You Were Here\" received largely positive reviews from critics.  Jody Rosen, writing for Rolling Stone magazine, described \"Wish You Were Here\" as a \"jangling power ballad\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic marked \"Wish You Were Here\" as a highlight of the album, Goodbye Lullaby. Al Fox, an editor of BBC Music, said that the song is one of the tracks from the album where \"Lavigne actually manages to communicate some real sentiment\". He also commented that it is \"an unassuming strum-along\". Bill Lamb of the website About.com found \"interesting arrangements and musical settings\" in the song. While reviewing Goodbye Lullaby, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy concluded that the main theme"

It was produced by Butch Walker, and released on January 12, 2009, as the album's third single. \"Thinking of You\" deals with a break-up in which Perry does not want to move on but has no choice, and feels nostalgic of a previous lover while in a relationship with another man.\nThe song peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the album's only single to fail to reach the Top 10 in the United States, and peaked at number 27 in the United Kingdom. There are two music videos released for the song. The first was released in 2007 and features Perry in two different rooms\u2014black and white\u2014and was directed by a friend of hers. The second was the commercial release in 2009, which is set in the 1940s and features Perry playing a woman who lost her lover, a soldier (played by Matt Dallas), in battle during World War II. Perry began playing the song during gigs as early as 2006, and performed the song on all of her concert tours: the Hello Katy Tour, the California Dreams Tour, the Prismatic World Tour and Witness: The Tour. In South America, the song was included in the international soundtrack of Brazilian soap opera India, a Love Story and became very successful.\n\"Thinking of You\" was written by Perry in 2002 and produced by Butch Walker. Amateur video of Perry performing an entirely acoustic version at the Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Los Angeles as early as 2006 is available on YouTube.

Perry's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of G\u266f\u2083 to the higher note of C\u2085. According to Perry, the lyrics of the song are about a break-up after which she doesn't want to move on but has no choice, and is thinking about her ex-boyfriend while she is with her current lover. Perry describes her former lover as \"perfection\" and feels disgusted with herself when she kisses her current boyfriend, calling him second best in comparison.\nWriting for BBC Music, Lizzie Ennever exalted her vocal performance while commenting that the song possesses \"edge\" and \"rawness\" that, according to Ennever, are characteristic of the \"real [Perry]\".

She co-wrote the song with Max Martin, Bonnie McKee, and its producers Dr. Luke and Cirkut. It was specifically written for Perry's autobiographical film Katy Perry: Part of Me. Capitol Records released the song onto radio stations on May 22, 2012. The track is a power ballad styled in dance-pop, and features lyrics about the reality of a break up and moving forward.\n\"Wide Awake\" became another commercial success for Perry, topping the charts in Canada and New Zealand while reaching number two in Lebanon and the United States. In America, the song was kept off the top spot by Carly Rae Jepsen's \"Call Me Maybe\". It also peaked within the top 10 in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, and the United Kingdom as well as the top 20 in Brazil, Italy, and Slovakia. The single's music video was directed by Lance Drake, and featured a fairy tale-like story, starring Perry and a child version of her. The video also makes references from Perry's Teenage Dream singles and the previous Complete Confection single \"Part of Me\".\nPerry co-wrote \"Wide Awake\" with Bonnie McKee, Max Martin, and its producers Cirkut and Dr. Luke. The production coordination was helmed by Irene Richter and Katie Mitzell. Recorded at NightBird Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California, it was engineered by Clint Gibbs, who was assisted by Angelo Caputo, and John Hanes, and was mixed by Serban Ghenea.\nAccording to Perry, \"Wide Awake\" was inspired by \"major life changes\", including her divorce from actor and comedian Russell Brand. In an interview with MTV News, Perry revealed, \"Well, this song, I have a lot of different emotions and feelings in all of my songs. This song in particular is a dose of reality. It's kind of like coming down from a high. You\u2019ve been on cloud nine for so long, and it can't always be so sweet and sometimes you need to realize that, and you have to pick yourself up and move forward and face the facts of life and know that this is just a lesson you learn and you're stronger because of it.\" Initially Max Martin had produced a demo with the chorus being \"No Matter What\" however due to his accent Mckee, misheard the lyrics as \"I'm Wide Awake/I'm Born Again and wrote the song around that hook. McKee opined that the song represented Perry's departure from her previous releases.\n\"Wide Awake\" impacted US contemporary hit radio on May 22, 2012 through Capitol Records, in support of Perry's autobiographical film Katy Perry: Part of Me. The single's cover artwork was released on the same day via Perry's Twitter account, featuring Perry with deep purple hair and multicolored lettering.\n\"Wide Awake\" is a midtempo dance-pop ballad. \"Wide Awake\" has a relatively rare pop song chord construction: it uses a single 4-chord progression (Gm7-Bb9-F-C) which repeats throughout the entire length of the song and never changes (another example of a non-changing 4-chord progression song is U2's \"With or Without You\"). Written in the key of F major, the song has a metronome of 80 beats per minute. Perry's vocals on the song span from the low-note of C\u2084 to the high-note of D\u2085.\n\"Wide Awake\" is lyrically about the reality of a break up and moving on, which many have believed to have been written about Perry's ex-husband, Russell Brand, since it was written and recorded after the divorce. Byron Flitsch from MTV stated that the downtempo melody of the song \"highlights the song's introspective lyrics\". Robbie Daw of Idolator described the song's lyrics as \"universally relatable\". Katy's Christian upbringing is also prominent on \"Wide Awake\", which references the concept of being born-again.\nJody Rosen from Rolling Stone awarded \"Wide Awake\" three and a half stars out of five. He praised the song's composition, provided by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Bonnie McKee, and also felt it was, musically, a more comfortable side for Perry than \"Part of Me\". Robert Copsey from Digital Spy commented that the song sees Perry in \"reflective mode\", and gave it four stars out of five.\nHowever, in an album review for Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly was more critical of the song, deeming it a \"weepie\" and a \"kind of bummer\", along with \"Part of Me\". In their list of \"The 10 Best Guilty Pleasure Songs of 2012\", Ernest Baker and Lauren Nostro from Complex listed \"Wide Awake\" at"

It was produced by Butch Walker, and released on January 12, 2009, as the album's third single. \"Thinking of You\" deals with a break-up in which Perry does not want to move on but has no choice, and feels nostalgic of a previous lover while in a relationship with another man.\nThe song peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the album's only single to fail to reach the Top 10 in the United States, and peaked at number 27 in the United Kingdom. There are two music videos released for the song. The first was released in 2007 and features Perry in two different rooms\u2014black and white\u2014and was directed by a friend of hers. The second was the commercial release in 2009, which is set in the 1940s and features Perry playing a woman who lost her lover, a soldier (played by Matt Dallas), in battle during World War II. Perry began playing the song during gigs as early as 2006, and performed the song on all of her concert tours: the Hello Katy Tour, the California Dreams Tour, the Prismatic World Tour and Witness: The Tour. In South America, the song was included in the international soundtrack of Brazilian soap opera India, a Love Story and became very successful.\n\"Thinking of You\" was written by Perry in 2002 and produced by Butch Walker. Amateur video of Perry performing an entirely acoustic version at the Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Los Angeles as early as 2006 is available on YouTube. The single was released on January 12, 2009, in the US, and in Australia a week later.\nAccording to digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony-ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of E major and the tempo moves at 76 beats per minute. Perry's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of G\u266f\u2083 to the higher note of C\u2085. According to Perry, the lyrics of the song are about a break-up after which she doesn't want to move on but has no choice, and is thinking about her ex-boyfriend while she is with her current lover. Perry describes her former lover as \"perfection\" and feels disgusted with herself when she kisses her current boyfriend, calling him second best in comparison.\nWriting for BBC Music, Lizzie Ennever exalted her vocal performance while commenting that the song possesses \"edge\" and \"rawness\" that, according to Ennever, are characteristic of the \"real [Perry]\". David Balls from Digital Spy described the track as a \"serious offering designed to show off her vocal and songwriting talents\", and compared it to the catalogues of Alanis Morissette and band Evanescence. Giving it three stars out of five, he wrote: \"So does she succeed? Well, certainly not for want of trying.\" In a less positive review, Nicole Frehsee from Rolling Stone dismissed the song as \"generic Dawson's Creek schlock\".\nJon Caramanica of The New York Times favored the song's production, stating that Perry works better with melody and emotion. He contrasted the song\u2014which he described as \"gently and compellingly angry\"\u2014with Perry's singles of sexual themes, and concluded that \"feeling deeply is shocking enough\". For Contactmusic.com, Kelda Manley called the song \"high quality\" whereas NME reviewer Alex Miller jokingly regarded it as having \"all the emotional subtlety of a flamethrower\". A writer for The Boston Globe found similarities to Alanis Morissette's musicality in the track, such as her \"sour melodicism\" and vocals. Reviewing the single for Billboard, editor CT praised Perry for her \"distinct vocal inflection\". Another writer of Capital described it as \"cracking\" and \"single material\".\nIn the United States, \"Thinking of You\" attained moderate success. The song debuted on the US Billboard component chart Bubbling Under Hot 100 at number 5. Three weeks later, it entered the primary Hot 100 chart at number 79; having climbed to number 50 in the following week. It rose fifteen spots one week after, giving the track the title of \"Greatest Digital Gainer\" for that chart issue. The following week, it reached a peak of number 29, where it stayed for more two weeks.

Life for Rent. The song was first released to US radio on 7 July 2003 and was issued in the United Kingdom as a physical single on 1 September 2003. The song performed well on record charts around the world, peaking at number one in Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Portugal. In Dido's native UK, it reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, and in the United States, it climbed to number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, features actor David Boreanaz as Dido's love interest.\n\"White Flag\" was nominated for the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards but lost to Christina Aguilera's \"Beautiful\". It won the Best British Single at the 2004 Brit Awards. The song has featured in several TV series including Smallville, The Inbetweeners, Medium, The Sopranos, Tru Calling, Cold Case, Winners & Losers, as well as in the films Perfect Stranger, Mommy and Bad Education. Carly Rae Jepsen performed a cover version of the song on Canadian Idol. \"White Flag\" ranked at number 317 on Blender's list \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\".\n\"White Flag\" was written and produced by Dido, Rick Nowels, and Rollo Armstrong. In the song, the protagonist is unwilling to give up, even if she knows her relationship is over.\n\"White Flag\" features \"multi-layered\" sound, delicate piano outro, and strings. The majority of the song is in the key of D minor, but constantly alternates between that key and its relative major, F major. The tempo is 90 beats per minute, and Dido's vocals range from the low note of A\u2083 to the high note of C\u2085.\nDavid Jeffries from AllMusic praised \"Dido's sweet delivery\" and stated that \"It\u2019s all very beautiful, the perfect soundtrack for weeping, and the definition of \"wistful\" in a song.\" Derryck Strachan wrote for BBC Music that the song is \"engaging to the extent that you could easily be humming along without it registering in your brain. There's something unconscious, pleasantly innocuous about it. It's comfort food for the ears and it could be easily on a Tom Hanks\u2013Meg Ryan romantic comedy.\" Alexis Petridis from The Guardian wrote that the song \"is a superb, confidently written pop song, possessed of a chorus that is impossible to dislodge from your memory without the aid of hypnotherapy.\"\nThe song was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 Grammy Awards, but lost to Christina Aguilera's \"Beautiful\". The song won the award for \"Best Single\" at the 2004 BRIT Awards.\nThe music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, features actor David Boreanaz as Dido's love interest.\nThe video tells a story about a relationship that is over, but where Dido is obviously still smitten with her ex, who is oblivious of her. They have numerous occasions where they are near each other without him noticing. Dido is clearly still not over him, while he doesn't seem to really notice she is there. At the end of the video, they return to their apartments and Dido's room is filled with photos of him and, in a twist ending, his apartment is also filled with Dido's photos (showing he's still as much in love with her as well.) The screen rotates throughout the entirety of the video, never standing still. The song's opening is also cut out entirely from the video.\nEuropean and Japanese CD single\n\"White Flag\" \u2013 3:58\n\"Paris\" \u2013 3:23\nEuropean 12-inch single\nA. \"White Flag\" (Beginnerz Remix) \u2013 7:33\nB. \"White Flag\" (Version Idjut) \u2013 7:12\nUS promo CD\n\"White Flag\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:36\nUS 7-inch single\nA. \"White Flag\" \u2013 4:00\nB. \"Don't Leave Home\" \u2013 3:46\nAustralian CD single\n\"White Flag\"\n\"Paris\"\n\"White Flag\" (Johnny Toobad mix)\nCredits are lifted from the European CD single liner notes.\nStudios\nRecorded and mixed at The Church\nAdditional recording at The Ark\nStrings recorded at Angel Studios\nMastered at Metropolis Studios\nPersonnel\nDido \u2013 writing (as Dido Armstrong), vocals, production\nRick Nowels \u2013 writing, guitar, keyboards\nRollo \u2013 writing (as Rollo Armstrong), production\nPaul Herman \u2013 additional acoustic guitar\nRusty Anderson \u2013 electric guitar\nMark Bates \u2013 additional keyboards, piano, programming\nP*Nut \u2013 drums and bass programming\nAsh Howes \u2013 recording, mixing\nGrippa \u2013 additional recording\nGavin Callaghan \u2013 recording assistant\nNathan Loughran \u2013 recording assistant\nNick Ingman \u2013 string arrangement\nGavyn Wright \u2013"

It was released in July 2020 as the lead single from his twelfth studio album Body Language. It was produced by Scott Hendricks and was written by Ross Copperman, Josh Osborne, and Matt Jenkins. Their fourth collaboration and released directly after their duet \"Nobody but You\", \"Happy Anywhere\" was released as a single via digital download and streaming on July 24, 2020, by Warner Records. To promote the song, Shelton's official website launched a contest where fans could upload pictures of themselves with their loved ones.\nMusically, \"Happy Anywhere\" is an upbeat country duet with similarities to their previous collaborations. The lyrics pertain to the couple's personal relationship and describe being able to find happiness anywhere, which alludes to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, the song peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 and had first week sales of 27,000 copies. It also reached number two on the main Digital Song Sales chart in the US, blocked from the top spot by Taylor Swift's 2020 single \"Cardigan\". In Canada, \"Happy Anywhere\" entered several of the country's Billboard charts.\nAn accompanying music video for the song was released the same day as the song and was produced by Todd Stefani, Gwen's brother. The clip is a montage of home video footage captured by Shelton and Stefani throughout their relationship.\nIn December 2019, Shelton and Stefani released their collaboration \"Nobody but You\", a newly recorded track for Shelton's third compilation album, Fully Loaded: God's Country (2019). The song was later released as a single from the project in January 2020, and achieved significant commercial success in the United States, where it topped Billboard's Country Airplay and Digital Songs charts and became Stefani's highest-charting effort on the Billboard Hot 100 since 2007. Following the impact of his previous collaboration with Stefani, Shelton commented: \"Even though Gwen and I just had a single out, we decided that, under the circumstances, this year ... man, there's never been a better time for 'Happy Anywhere'.\" Shelton first teased the release on July 20, 2020, in an official press release. That same day, he unveiled the single cover art via his official Instagram account. He also confirmed Stefani's involvement with the track and stated it was inspired by the events of the COVID-19 pandemic. The song was written by Ross Copperman, Josh Osborne, and Matt Jenkins.\nThe song was released to music retailers for digital download and streaming on July 24, 2020, through Warner Records. It marks Shelton and Stefani's fourth collaboration, following \"Go Ahead and Break My Heart\" (2016), \"You Make It Feel Like Christmas\" (2017), and \"Nobody but You\". In the United States, it was sent to country radio outlets for airplay the next day. In September 2020, Shelton's official website announced a contest where fans could upload pictures of themselves with a \"description of the person that makes you happy anywhere\"; the stories were then posted on a world map on the site.\nMusically, \"Happy Anywhere\" is an upbeat country song. The track has been described as a love song and Shelton referred to it as a \"loving, feel-good tune\". Stefani provides less vocals for \"Happy Anywhere\" than she previously did in \"Nobody but You\", and does not have a solo verse or chorus; however, she contributes to harmonies with Shelton.\nAccording to the song's sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, \"Happy Anywhere\" is set in common time and has a moderately slow tempo with 166 beats per minute. The key of the song is in A-flat major, with the pair's vocal range spanning from E\u266d\u2084 to E\u266d\u2085 in scientific pitch notation. The song begins with a short instrumental intro, followed by two verses, each succeeded by a chorus. The first verse begins using the chord progressions of A\u266d\u2013D\u266d\u2013E\u266d, which are replicated during the other verses; during the chorus, the progressions transition to a structure of G-Am-Bm-C/Am.\nRegarding the lyrical content of \"Happy Anywhere\", Shelton remarked: \"We've all been in quarantine and lockdown, and hopefully we've been doing that with somebody that we really love and enjoy being around. That's what happened with Gwen and me"

The song was produced by West, BoogzDaBeast and Xcelence. The producers wrote it alongside Aaron Butts, though the song's sampling of work by Whole Truth led to songwriting credits being listed for Calvin and Curtis Eubanks. It was playlisted to UK mainstream radio by the BBC as the album's lead single on November 8, 2019, through GOOD Music and Def Jam. Around the time of release, the song was the top performing track from Jesus Is King on streaming services. A religious hip hop track, it includes a sample of \"Can You Lose by Following God\" by Whole Truth, which is chopped up in certain sections.\nThe lyrics of \"Follow God\" are about Kanye West's connection with his father, which is in reference to both God and his biological father Ray West, while the meaning of being \"Christlike\" is questioned by him. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics; many named it the best track on Jesus Is King. Critics appreciated the bouncing beat and Whole Truth sample, and complimented West's rapping flow and pace. The song was awarded Top Gospel Song and Rap/Hip Hop Recorded Song of the Year at the Billboard Music Awards and 51st GMA Dove Awards in 2020, respectively.\nCommercially, \"Follow God\" debuted at number 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming West's 18th track to reach the top 10 on the chart. The song also reached the top 10 in nine other countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. It was later certified platinum and silver in the United States and the United Kingdom by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI), respectively. An accompanying music video was screened on November 6, 2019, and released the following day. It shows Kanye and Ray West drive ATVs in snow in Cody, Wyoming. The video concludes with a message from Kanye about his relationship with Ray West. Kanye West performed the song with the Sunday Service Choir as part of his Sunday Service concerts in 2019.\nKanye West produced \"Follow God\" with Xcelence and BoogzDaBeast, the latter of which is one of Jesus Is King's lesser-known producers who contributed to six of its tracks. West previously worked with BoogzDaBeast on the 2018 self-titled debut studio album by Kids See Ghosts, a hip hop duo composed of West and Kid Cudi. The song title was first revealed in a revised track listing of Jesus Is King that West's wife Kim Kardashian shared via Twitter on September 27, 2019. West later previewed the track at a listening party for the album at The Forum in the Los Angeles County on October 23 of that year.\nThe song samples \"Can You Lose By Following God\" (1969) by gospel band Whole Truth, which was featured on archival record label The Numero Group's 2013 compilation album Good God! Apocryphal Hymns. Though the album was not confirmed to be the sample source, West had often sampled music released through the archival record label in the past, including on his tracks \"Bound 2\", \"Facts\", \"Ghost Town\", and \"4th Dimension\". Brothers Calvin and Curtis Eubanks received credit as writers on \"Follow God\" because they contributed backing vocals to \"Can You Lose By Following God\". The song was co-written by West, Aaron Butts, Xcelence and BoogzDaBeast. \"Follow God\" was one of the three tracks that caused the release of Jesus Is King to be delayed due to mixing modifications. West collaborator Consequence explained that the song was important to West due to him being \"up against the ghost of\" his previous tracks such as \"Otis\", \"Good Morning\", \"Champion\" and \"Heard 'Em Say\". According to Consequence, \"Follow God\" had \"to go somewhere new\" and \"be mechanically in tune with the people.\" Consequence said the song \"is a dirty version that got cleaned up,\" which he and West opted for, believing it was an authentic version that \"the people are going to gravitate to\". West cited \"Follow God\" as an example of him creating a track \"that people never heard before.\"\n\"Follow God\" is a hip hop track which features a chopped up sample of Whole Truth's soul recording \"Can You Lose by Following God\". It was compared to West's earlier releases which used samples, and his 2016 song \"Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1\". \"Follow God\" is built around the sample's vocal line, \"Father, I stretch/Stretch my hands to You,\" which begins from the 1:32 mark of the sample. It opens with the sample used as a declaration.\nThe lyrics are about Kanye's"

The song contains vocals from rappers Ty Dolla Sign and 070 Shake, along with a voicemail message from rapper Nicki Minaj. West, 070 Shake, Mike Dean, Kevin Parker, Ty Dolla Sign, Malik Yusef, 7 Aurelius, Irv Gotti, and Pardison Fontaine wrote the song. Fontaine was revealed by West to have contributed to most of the writing and felt unhappy with him for revealing this information. The song features an R&B background and West raps about his feelings towards fathering a daughter within his verse.\n\"Violent Crimes\" received mixed to negative reviews from music critics, with the majority of them criticizing West's rapping and mostly panning his lyricism, while its position as the closing track also faced criticism. However, some critics that generally placed less focus on West's verse expressed more positive feelings, often highlighting the inclusion of the song on the album and sometimes complementing the composition. In 2018, the song reached number 27 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and also attained top 40 positions on the Canadian Hot 100, Irish Singles Chart and ARIA Singles Chart. It was certified platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). An accompanying lyric video was released on June 19, 2018, featuring visuals reminiscent of the cover art for Ye. In January 2019, the Sunday Service Choir performed the song live, led by West. The song was later flipped within the track \"Brothers\", which surfaced online in July 2019.\nAlong with \"Violent Crimes\", Ty Dolla Sign also has vocals on Ye tracks \"All Mine\" and \"Wouldn't Leave\". On June 4, 2018, three days after the album's release, Ty Dolla Sign teased a joint album with West. He recalled \"going off on the backgrounds, no Auto-Tune\" when working with West in a phone conversation with Rolling Stone on August 30 of that year. 070 Shake saw an increase in popularity after appearing on the track and \"Ghost Town\" from the album, which was recorded in 2018. When asked in a June 2018 interview with Billboard about how she felt to be a part of the track, 070 Shake was quoted as saying: \nLook, it feels good. I love being apart of [music with a message], no matter who it is. My goal is to be able to impact people in a positive way. So that just made the song that much better.\n West asked his wife Kim Kardashian to get Nicki Minaj's help with figuring out how to deliver some lines on \"Violent Crimes\", yet he ultimately decided on including the actual voice note itself that was received from her. Nicki Minaj revealed on Queen Radio that she was initially surprised when Ye premiered due to being unsure about how her voice note would end up being used. West had previously collaborated with Nicki Minaj on his 2010 single \"Monster\" that features Jay-Z, Rick Ross and Bon Iver alongside her, which he references with the lines \"I hope she like Nicki, I'll make her a monster/Not havin' menages\".\nCo-writer Kevin Parker of Tame Impala was unaware that the track would be on the album until a friend informed him that it was being played at the listening party; Parker previously thought he was credited on \"Ghost Town\", not \"Violent Crimes\". Allegedly, Parker sent a number of samples to West for the album, though assumed that they hadn't made the cut after not hearing back from him. Prior to co-producer 7 Aurelius receiving credit on the song, he had been inactive musically since 2012. West's track \"Brothers\" later surfaced online in July 2019 with production included from 7 Aurelius, and the track flips \"Violent Crimes\".\n\"Violent Crimes\" is a \"lullaby\" that includes an R&B background. It is linked to \"essentially, since he became a father to a daughter\", West knowing \"how to treat women better\". The song begins with low-key production and long piano tones, with 070 Shake performing the intro, as well as the chorus. West's verse sees him rap about thoughts towards fathering a daughter from his position, expressing fears of her being victimized by men. The need for West to keep his daughter protected from \"pimps\", \"monsters\" and \"playas\" is mentioned by him. By offering ambitions as a father, West attempts to undo his years of misogyny. Ty Dolla Sign contributes softly sung vocals to the song that appear next to those of 070 Shake, prior to Nicki Minaj's outro.\nPiercing the silence as the song begins to wind down, Nicki Minaj's vocals on the outro consist of a voice recording,"

The song was produced by West, while co-produced by Jeff Bhasker. The producers co-wrote it with Esthero, Malik Yusef, and Starshell. West initially shared the song via his blog on September 10, 2008, before re-recording it after negative reactions. The song was later released for digital download on September 18, 2008 by Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam as the lead single from the album. An electropop song, its instrumentation relies on piano and Roland TR-808 drumbeats.\nWest sings through Auto-Tune on the song, with the lyrics looking at a failed relationship's after effects. \"Love Lockdown\" received widely positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented the production. Some directed praise towards the drums in the production, while numerous critics highlighted West's vocal performance on the song. It was named to year-end lists for 2008 by multiple publications, including Pitchfork and Blender. The song won the award of Best Rap/Hip Hop Dance Track at the 2009 International Dance Music Awards. On the US Billboard Hot 100, it became West's highest debut by entering at number three on the chart. The song also reached the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.\n\"Love Lockdown\" has been certified quadruple platinum and gold in the United States and the UK by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI), respectively. An accompanying music video premiered on October 7, 2008. The video replicates the role of Christian Bale in the American film American Psycho (2000), with West making his appearance in his own apartment while all colour has been removed from the rooms. In 2008, Time listed the visual as their Video of the Year.\nWest first performed the song live at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, taking influence from the 2008 Summer Olympics' opening ceremony for the performance. He later performed it on multiple occasions, including at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Hollywood Bowl in 2011 and 2015, respectively. The song was used for Grand Theft Auto's standalone video game compilation, Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City (2009). Cover versions of it were performed by Glass Animals and Lorde in 2014 and 2018, respectively. A remix 12\" vinyl was released in November 2008 for \"Love Lockdown\", which included remixes done by Chew Fu and Jake Trothn, among others.\nAround the time of West's third studio album Graduation being released in September 2007, American record producer Jeff Bhasker started to play keyboards for West's band due to them needing someone to fill in. Originally, Bhasker met West through the rapper's DJ A-Trak and was trying to increase name recognition for himself as a producer by working with West; Bhasker called him \"awesome\". He contributed writing to multiple songs on 808s & Heartbreak, including \"Love Lockdown\", which was co-written by West, Esthero, Malik Yusef, and Starshell. Bhasker recalled that all of the songwriters \"deciphered what\" was being said on the song's demo, shortly after it had been freestyled in full by West. According to Bhasker, the writers helped fill in the words when deciphering West's demo and he admitted collaborators are needed \"that understand songwriting to make the song as good as it can be, even if its not like, 'Okay, let's try this melody or that melody.'\" West produced the song, while co-production was handled by Bhasker. After she accidentally met West in the hallway of a recording studio, Starshell participated in a songwriting session. During the session, the track was written. Starshell later expressed feelings of gladness that she had worked with West, since gathering the experience early in her career helped her understand how the music business works. She explained, stating: \"In this industry, it's about networking and relationships.\"\nInspired by 1980s synthpop icons such as Phil Collins, Gary Numan and Boy George for the material on 808s & Heartbreak, West considered the tracks to be more minimal and functional due to him making usage of the Roland TR-808 drum machine.

The song was written by Max, Madison Love, M\u00e5ns Wredenberg, Noonie Bao, and producers Cirkut and Lotus IV. It is a dance-pop song with lyrics about a girl being gaslighted, serving as a continuation from Max's 2018 song \"Sweet but Psycho\". The Isaac Rentz-directed music video was released on July 30, 2020, and features Max seeking revenge on her boss and cheating boyfriend.\nMax first teased \"Who's Laughing Now\" on her social media accounts on May 28, 2020, before officially announcing the single's initial June 2, 2020 release date, and cover art the next day. The release date was subsequently postponed because it coincided with Blackout Tuesday. She then announced that the song would be released on June 25, 2020, but was also indefinitely delayed on June 17, 2020. She eventually announced that it would be released on July 30, 2020. The cover art depicts a topless Max positioned in front of a flaming background. \"Who's Laughing Now\" was written by Max, Madison Love, M\u00e5ns Wredenberg, Noonie Bao, Cirkut and Lotus IV, with the latter two handling production.\n\"Who's Laughing Now\" is a dance-pop song, which contains several minor chords. Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic compared the song's island groove to artists such as Clean Bandit and Ace of Base. It was written as a continuation from her 2018 song \"Sweet but Psycho\", as the lyrics both describe a misunderstood girl being gaslighted, and serve as an analogy to Max's own experiences being rejected in the music industry. She summarized the song as \"basically telling everyone to just fuck off\". Max stated that \"Who's Laughing Now\" is targeted towards females who had bullied her throughout middle school, causing her to start home-school. The song's title was envisioned after a self-discovery revelation by Max.\nWriting for Us Weekly, Nicholas Hautman praised the chorus of \"Who's Laughing Now\", indicating that it had the catchiest \"don't cha\" since the Pussycat Dolls song \"Don't Cha\" (2005). However, Issy Sampson of The Guardian criticized the song for sounding similar to \"Sweet but Psycho\", which she described as an \"irritating earworm\". She added that the former used a \"smug\" horrible personality trait in place of \"psychotic.\"\nThe music video was directed by Isaac Rentz and released on July 30, 2020. Max is depicted as a person seeking revenge after being fired by her boss and cheated on by her boyfriend. She is seen dancing in a destroyed office and breaking a car with a crowbar, before breaking free of a psychiatric hospital while strapped in a straitjacket. Max wrote the video's plot, which she decided to incorporate several female characters into a corporate workforce dominated by men. One character portrayed by Max is gaslighted by a doctor into becoming \"psycho\", while another had musical instruments appearing from her head, which was parallel to her own negative experiences with music executives. An interactive quiz was launched as a collaboration with Spotify prior to the release of Max's debut studio album Heaven & Hell (2020). It contains 10 questions asking about personality, resulting in the choice of one of four characters portrayed in the music video; Amanda, Torrence, Carmen, and Ava.\nDigital download / Streaming\n\"Who's Laughing Now\"\u00a0\u2013  3:00\nDigital download / streaming \u2013 The Remixes\n\"Who's Laughing Now\" (Breathe Carolina Remix)\u00a0\u2013  2:24\n\"Who's Laughing Now\" (Cat Dealers Remix)\u00a0\u2013  3:40\nDigital download / streaming \u2013 The Remixes\n\"Who's Laughing Now\" (KOLIDESCOPES Remix)\u00a0\u2013  3:20\n\"Who's Laughing Now\" (COASTR.

It was released as the lead single from the album on March 17, 2008, by Warner Bros. Records. It marked the first time in Madonna's 25-year career that another artist was featured in her own single. According to Madonna, the song is about saving the environment and \"having a good time while we are doing it\". She also cited the song as the inspiration for the documentary I Am Because We Are (2008).\nThe song was recorded at Sarm West Studios, in London, while the mixing of the track was finished at The Hit Factory studio, in New York City. Sound engineer Demo Castellon first worked on the vocals and then on the beats, while the synths were composed by Timbaland and Danja. An uptempo dance-pop song with an urban and hip hop style, \"4 Minutes\" incorporates Timbaland's characteristic bhangra beats and the instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cowbells. The lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.\n\"4 Minutes\" received positive reviews from music critics, who called it a busy dance track and complimented its music, which was compared to that of a marching band. Some reviewers, however, felt that Madonna sounded like a featured artist on her own song. The song peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100, giving Madonna her 37th top-ten single, breaking the record previously held by Elvis Presley, as the artist with most top-ten hits. Internationally, \"4 Minutes\" topped the charts in 21 countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.  \"4 Minutes\" has sold over three million copies in the United States and a total of five million copies worldwide.\nThe music video shows Madonna and Timberlake singing and running away from a giant black screen that devours everything in its path. \"4 Minutes\" was performed by Madonna on the promotional tour for Hard Candy and during the rave segment of the 2008\u20132009 Sticky & Sweet Tour. The song received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical at the 2009 ceremony.\nFollowing the release of her tenth studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), Madonna wanted to record more dance music. When asked by producer Stuart Price what kind of music appealed to her, Madonna replied that she loved the records of singer Justin Timberlake and producer Timbaland, so she collaborated with them. \"4 Minutes\" was written by all three artists, along with Nate \"Danja\" Hills, and produced by Timbaland, Timberlake and Danja. The song, initially named \"4 Minutes to Save the World\", was one of the last to be produced for Madonna's album Hard Candy. In an interview with MTV News, Madonna said that the concept of the song was developed through discussions with Timberlake. She further explained the meaning of the song:\nI don't think it's important to take it too literally. I think the song, more than anything, is about having a sense of urgency; about how we are you know, living on borrowed time essentially and people are becoming much more aware of the environment and how we're destroying the planet. We can't just keep distracting ourselves we do have to educate ourselves and wake up and do something about it. You know at the same time we don't want to be boring and serious and not have fun so it's kind of like well if we're going to save the planet can we have a good time while we are doing it?\nMadonna clarified that her age did not have anything to do with the sense of urgency reflected in the track; instead, it was just something that she had in mind for a long time and with \"4 Minutes\", the sense seeped into her music. Ingrid Sischy from Interview magazine said that the song felt like a ballad for the world, containing \"the sounds of a great big marching band. It's a giant dance song\". Madonna agreed with Sischy and responded that the song was \"a funny paradox\" and was one of the inspirations behind her"

Written by Usher, Dupri and Cox, the song is a confession of a man to his woman about his impregnated mistress. This is a continuation of \"Confessions Part I\" which relates to a man's infidelity. Its personal content evoked rumors and early responses from the public even before its release, believing that Usher was asserting the truth; however, Dupri divulged that the story behind the album is about himself.\n\"Confessions Part II\" received mixed reviews from critics. The song was released as the third single from the album, following the success of \"Burn\".  The single reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, becoming the album's third consecutive number-one single. Internationally, the single had lesser success than the album's previous releases.\nWhen he started working on his fourth studio album Confessions after the release of his 2001 album 8701, Usher chose not to branch out much with musical collaborators; instead, he chose to continue creating music with his previous producers. He again enlisted producer-songwriter Jermaine Dupri, who had produced songs for Usher's two previous albums. Dupri approached Bryan-Michael Cox, asking him to become a collaborator. Cox has been a frequent partner of Dupri who had produced hits for Usher as well. Like \"Burn\", the second single from the album, Dupri and Cox conversed about a situation, creating the idea of the prospective song. However, they were concerned because they needed somebody to write such a song and they never thought Usher would do it. The concept became \"Confessions\".\nUsher started recording the song in July 2003 in New York City. One day, before the night was over, Usher was singing about impregnating a mistress and becoming displeased, having found that she is three months pregnant. The theme of cheating inspired him and Dupri, and they then decided to produce two parts of \"Confessions\": Part I and Part II. Usher said that the former is a \"dramatization where a guy confesses all the stuff he's been doing\" against his woman. The latter speaks of impregnating a mistress.\nWhile Confessions was still in production, Usher promised \"real talk\" in it. He decided \"to let it all hang out by singing about some of his own little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets.\" He explained: \"All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of.\"  He further noted that, for the most part, the album's subject matter is \"very personal\". Dupri expected people to question some of the personal lyrics they associated in the song.\n\"Confessions Part II\" was released as the third single from the album, following \"Burn\". The single was released in the United States as a 12-inch single on August 24, 2004. It was released in Germany on October 18, and Australia on October 26, 2004, featuring the album and remix version of the track and a song called \"Whatever I Want\". In the United Kingdom, it was issued as a double A-side with \"My Boo\", the fourth single from the album. The single was released in the country on November 1, 2004.\nUsher held few listening parties for the album prior to its release. Shortly after, people came up with different interpretations of \"Confessions Part II\", among other personal songs in the album. In 2003, Usher's two-year relationship with TLC's Chilli was going to \"flame-out\", which partly contributed to the concept of  \"Burn\". They finally broke up early in 2004 because of \"irreconcilable differences and because the two found it almost impossible to make compromises\" which partly triggered public speculation that some of the songs in the album are in reference to his personal struggle. They referred to the song speaking about Usher's \"infidelity\" to Chilli.\nAlongside the \"cheating\" rumors, the public inferred from the lyrics that Usher had impregnated a mistress in real life. Usher, however, emphasized that he was not in a relationship or \"got another girl pregnant\" and he was singing a \"character\". The similarity of situations he faced before and experiences of his friends collectively inspired him to write the song. In the middle of rumors, Dupri admitted that the stories behind the songs in the"

It features guest vocals by Trinidadian-American rapper Nicki Minaj and English rapper M.I.A. The song was written and produced by Madonna and Martin Solveig, with additional writing by M.I.A., Minaj and Michael Tordjman. After working with Solveig on one song, Madonna continued recording others including \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\". Madonna chose to work with M.I.A. and Minaj on the track since she felt they were both strong women with unique voices. She also liked their music and what they represented.\nA demo version of the song, titled \"Give Me All Your Love\", was leaked on November 8, 2011, resulting in a man from Spain being arrested for copyright violations. The final version of the song was released on February 3, 2012, as the lead single from MDNA. The track was her debut single from her three-album deal with Interscope Records. Backed by bouncing synthesizers, marching drums and a cheer, \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" is a dance-pop song, with elements of new wave and disco. Madonna executes the chorus in high-pitched vocals while during its dubstep breakdown, Minaj raps her verse as her alter-ego Roman Zolanski, followed by M.I.A. rapping her verse.\n\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Its chorus was noted as a highlight by critics, who described it as catchy; however, they felt that the musical composition was inferior to Madonna's previous singles. Commercially, the song attained success, topping the charts in Canada, Finland, Hungary, and Israel while peaking within the top ten in several European countries. In the United States, it became Madonna's 38th top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, extending her record as the artist with the most top-ten singles in the chart's history, a record that would be surpassed later by Drake in 2020.\nThe song's accompanying music video featuring both Minaj and M.I.A. was directed by Megaforce. It shows Madonna, Minaj, and M.I.A. along with cheerleaders wearing animegao masks and football players. Madonna first performed the song with Minaj and M.I.A. at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show. During the performance, M.I.A. extended her middle finger towards the camera while rapping her verse. She was criticized in the media and broadcaster NBC and the National Football League (NFL) issued apologies. They also fined the rapper which was resolved through a confidential agreement. Later that year, Madonna also performed \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" on The MDNA Tour, where she wore a majorette outfit.\nIn December 2010, Madonna posted a message on her Facebook, exclaiming: \"Its official! I need to move. I need to sweat. I need to make new music! Music I can dance to. I'm on the lookout for the maddest, sickest, most badass people to collaborate with. I'm just saying\". One of the collaborators was French DJ and producer Martin Solveig, who was invited to a writing session by Madonna in London in July 2011. Originally, Madonna wanted to work with Solveig on one song, but eventually it turned into three tracks\u2014\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\", \"I Don't Give A\", and \"Turn Up the Radio\". In an interview with Billboard, Solveig explained that Madonna had enough time for the project, hence after working on one song, they continued recording. Solveig described the sessions as fun and labeled them a \"privileged time\".\n\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" was written by Madonna, Martin Solveig, Nicki Minaj, M.I.A., and Michael Tordjman, while production was helmed by Madonna and Solveig. Madonna had wanted to work with M.I.A. and Minaj on a song, since she felt that they are both \"strong women with a unique voices\". She paid tribute to the stars, saying \"[Minaj and M.I.A. are] not conventional pop stars and I really admire them both\". M.I.A. confirmed the collaboration on her Twitter account, saying that she had been asked to come to New York City on November 29, 2011. The rapper felt that the collaboration was an achievement her mother would be proud of, \"way [more] than me putting 'Galang' out in a club.\"\nOn November 8, 2011, a demo version of the song, named \"Give Me All Your Love\", was leaked. According to Keith Caulfield from Billboard, \"Within a few hours, [the song and its leak] was one of the top 10 trending topics worldwide on"

It was released as the lead single from the album on March 17, 2008, by Warner Bros. Records. It marked the first time in Madonna's 25-year career that another artist was featured in her own single. According to Madonna, the song is about saving the environment and \"having a good time while we are doing it\". She also cited the song as the inspiration for the documentary I Am Because We Are (2008).\nThe song was recorded at Sarm West Studios, in London, while the mixing of the track was finished at The Hit Factory studio, in New York City. Sound engineer Demo Castellon first worked on the vocals and then on the beats, while the synths were composed by Timbaland and Danja. An uptempo dance-pop song with an urban and hip hop style, \"4 Minutes\" incorporates Timbaland's characteristic bhangra beats and the instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cowbells. The lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.\n\"4 Minutes\" received positive reviews from music critics, who called it a busy dance track and complimented its music, which was compared to that of a marching band. Some reviewers, however, felt that Madonna sounded like a featured artist on her own song. The song peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100, giving Madonna her 37th top-ten single, breaking the record previously held by Elvis Presley, as the artist with most top-ten hits. Internationally, \"4 Minutes\" topped the charts in 21 countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.  \"4 Minutes\" has sold over three million copies in the United States and a total of five million copies worldwide.\nThe music video shows Madonna and Timberlake singing and running away from a giant black screen that devours everything in its path. \"4 Minutes\" was performed by Madonna on the promotional tour for Hard Candy and during the rave segment of the 2008\u20132009 Sticky & Sweet Tour. The song received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical at the 2009 ceremony.\nFollowing the release of her tenth studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), Madonna wanted to record more dance music. When asked by producer Stuart Price what kind of music appealed to her, Madonna replied that she loved the records of singer Justin Timberlake and producer Timbaland, so she collaborated with them. \"4 Minutes\" was written by all three artists, along with Nate \"Danja\" Hills, and produced by Timbaland, Timberlake and Danja. The song, initially named \"4 Minutes to Save the World\", was one of the last to be produced for Madonna's album Hard Candy. In an interview with MTV News, Madonna said that the concept of the song was developed through discussions with Timberlake. She further explained the meaning of the song:\nI don't think it's important to take it too literally. I think the song, more than anything, is about having a sense of urgency; about how we are you know, living on borrowed time essentially and people are becoming much more aware of the environment and how we're destroying the planet. We can't just keep distracting ourselves we do have to educate ourselves and wake up and do something about it. You know at the same time we don't want to be boring and serious and not have fun so it's kind of like well if we're going to save the planet can we have a good time while we are doing it?\nMadonna clarified that her age did not have anything to do with the sense of urgency reflected in the track; instead, it was just something that she had in mind for a long time and with \"4 Minutes\", the sense seeped into her music. Ingrid Sischy from Interview magazine said that the song felt like a ballad for the world, containing \"the sounds of a great big marching band. It's a giant dance song\". Madonna agreed with Sischy and responded that the song was \"a funny paradox\" and was one of the inspirations behind her"

The album was released with the intention of toning down the image of Madonna, who was being heavily criticized at the time. She wrote and produced the song with Canadian musician David Foster. \"You'll See\" was released on October 30, 1995, by Maverick Records as the lead single from the album. An acoustic pop ballad, \"You'll See\" features instrumentation from percussion, tremolo guitar and piano, while lyrically it speaks of independence after the end of a love affair.\nThe song received positive reception from contemporary critics, with reviewers praising Madonna's vocals. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) honored it as the Most Performed Song, in their annual ASCAP Pop Awards for 1997. \"You'll See\" was commercially successful, reaching the top five in Austria, Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom. The single also managed to peak at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 making it Madonna's 29th top-ten single on the chart.\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Michael Haussman, where the story line served as a sequel to Madonna's previous music video for \"Take a Bow\". An alternate Spanish version, written by Argentine singer-songwriter Paz Martinez, also received a music video, and was included on the Latin American edition of Something to Remember. Madonna has performed the song live on the British television program Top of the Pops and on selected US shows of her 2001 Drowned World Tour. In 2009, Scottish singer Susan Boyle included a cover of the song on her debut studio album I Dreamed a Dream.\nAfter a controversy-fueled period, Madonna's personal life had started to dominate over her musical career. \"She knew it was time to make a change\" as said by one anonymous member of her management team who claimed that she wanted to prove there was more to her than the constant media circus surrounding her. In November 1995, Madonna released a compilation album, Something to Remember, featuring a selection of her ballads over a decade of her career and three new songs; described as a \"love letter from Madonna to her fans and music lovers alike\" the compilation was targeted to emphasize the singer's musical abilities, and away from the theatrics. On the album's liner notes, Madonna further explained:\nSo much controversy has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs are all but forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate the idea of doing things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.\nFor the new songs, Madonna worked with David Foster, a well-known producer who had worked with the likes of Barbra Streisand, Al Jarreau and Earth, Wind & Fire. Foster initially did not expect Madonna would collaborate with him, as he believed that his music would not \"really [be] hip enough for her\". The recording session with Foster resulted in two new songs to the final track list, \"You'll See\" and \"One More Chance\". Foster commented: \"At the end of the day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, 'You'll See', was really great. Madonna had written a great lyric ('You think that I can't live without your love / You'll see') and I thought my music was great\". The track was produced and arranged by Madonna and Foster, who worked on the song during the third weekend of September 1995.\nRecording of the song was done in Brooklyn Studios and assisted by Ronnie Rivera. It was engineered and mixed by David Reitzas, who also produced the remix of \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" for Something to Remember. Simon Franglen provided synclavier programming for the song. Only three instruments were used for the song\u2014acoustic guitar played by Dean Parks, electric guitar played by Michael Thompson and keyboard played by Foster. A Spanish version of the song, titled \"Ver\u00e1s\", was recorded by Madonna at Gloria and Emilio Estefan's studio in Miami. The song was translated into Spanish by Paz Martinez and was included as a bonus track on the Latin American editions of Something to Remember. \"You'll See\" premiered on the radio forums of the official Warner Bros. Records' website on October 18, 1995 and was officially released"

Warner Bros. Records released it on October 4, 1999, as the first single from Hill's fourth album of the same name (1999). The song was produced by Byron Gallimore and Hill. \"Breathe\" became Hill's seventh number one on the Hot Country Songs chart in the United States, spending six weeks at number one. It also peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in April 2000. Despite not peaking at number one, it was the number-one pop single of 2000.\nBill Lamb from About.com said that country singer Faith Hill \"leaned heavily in a pop direction\" on \"Breathe\". He described it as \"a classic power ballad\". In 2005, Blender ranked it at number 167 in their list of \"Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\". They described it as a \"swooning ballad [that] turns country gal into Mississippi queen.\" The Daily Vault's Alfredo Narvaez said it is a \"great song\", adding, \"if it is not a single already, it must be soon. This song is destined for the prom night halls and the wedding receptions of tomorrow. (Yeah, it's that good and strong.)\"\nOn October 4, 1999, \"Breathe\" was released US radio, and on February 8, 2000, it was issued as a physical single. The song spent six weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, seventeen weeks at number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, and one week at number one on the Adult Top 40 chart. The song also reached a peak of number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five non-consecutive weeks starting with the week ending April 22, 2000. It was kept off the top position by Santana's \"Maria Maria\" featuring The Product G&B and \"Try Again\" by Aaliyah.\nEven though \"Breathe\" never made it to number one on the weekly Billboard Hot 100 chart, it was on the chart for 53 weeks and named the number one single of 2000 on Billboard's year-end countdown. It was one of only three songs in the history of the Hot 100 to be named the number one single of the year without making it to the top of the chart on any of the weekly surveys. (The first was \"Wooly Bully\" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs in 1965, and the third was \"Hanging by a Moment\" by Lifehouse in 2001.)\nIn 2009, the single was named the twenty-seventh most-successful song of the 2000s, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. The song was released in the United Kingdom in May 2000 and reached number 33.\nUS CD single\n\"Breathe\" [Pop Version] \u2013 4:10\n\"It All Comes Down to Love\" \u2013 4:16\nUS Promo The Hex Hector Remixes\n\"Breathe\" [Main 7\" Mix \u2013 Recall] \u2013 3:55\n\"Breathe\" [Main 7\" TV \u2013 Recall] \u2013 4:04\n\"Breathe\" [Main 7\" Instrumental \u2013 Recall] \u2013 4:04\n\"Breathe\" [Main 7\" Acapella \u2013 Recall] \u2013 3:44\n\"Breathe\" [Main Radio Edit] \u2013 3:58\n\"Breathe\" [Main Radio Edit TV track] \u2013 3:58\n\"Breathe\" [Main Radio Edit Instrumental] \u2013 3:58\n\"Breathe\" [Main Club Mix Vocal up] \u2013 10:10\n\"Breathe\" [Main Club Mix Instrumental] \u2013 10:10\n\"Breathe\" [Main Club Dub] \u2013 8:55\nUK CD single\n\"Breathe\" [Pop Version] \u2013 4:09\n\"This Kiss\" [Pop Radio Version] \u2013 3:16\n\"What's In it For Me\" \u2013 5:36\nEurope promo\n\"Breathe\" [Pop Remix] \u2013 4:10\n\"Breathe\" [Hex Hector Radio Edit] \u2013 5:55\nEurope maxi-CD\n\"Breathe\" [Tin Tin Out Radio Mix] \u2013 3:57\n\"Breathe\" [Radio Version] \u2013 4:08\n\"Breathe\" [Main Club Mix] \u2013 10:10\nOther versions\n\"Breathe\" 2010 (Freemasons Remix) \u2013 3:12\n2000 Billboard Music Awards: Hot 100 Single of the Year won\n2000 Billboard Music Awards: Hot 100 Airplay Track of the Year won\n2000 Grammy Awards: Best Female Country Vocal Performance won\n2000 Grammy Awards: Best Country Song nominated\n2000 Grammy Awards: Song of the Year nominated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian singer Wanessa Camargo made a cover in Portuguese named \"Eu Posso Te Sentir (I Can Feel You)\".\nSmartbomb has covered \"Breathe\" on their CD Yeah.

Released as the second single from West's second album, Late Registration (2005), \"Gold Digger\" peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 on September 6, 2005, becoming West's and Foxx's second number one single. Co-produced with Jon Brion, the song contains samples of Ray Charles' \"I Got a Woman\".\nThe single broke a record for the most digital downloads in a week, selling over 80,000, and at the time was also the fastest-selling digital download of all time; both records have since been broken. It was 2005's second-longest running number one on the Billboard Hot 100 behind \"We Belong Together\" by Mariah Carey and is the joint sixth longest ever at ten weeks.\nAt the 2006 Grammy Awards, \"Gold Digger\" was nominated for Record of the Year and won the award for Best Rap Solo Performance. The song lists at number 60 on Billboard magazine's All Time Top 100 and at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. \"Gold Digger\" was voted number 20 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. The single topped The 2005 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. As of January 2011, the song has sold over 3,000,000 copies in the United States. In 2018, The song was ranked 63 on the Top 100 Billboard Hot 100 Songs of all time, as part of Billboard's celebration of the 60th anniversary. \"Gold Digger\" is one of the best-selling singles in the United States.\nUpon its release, many surmised that West conceived \"Gold Digger\" after watching Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning portrayal of Ray Charles in the biographical film Ray. However, he had actually constructed the beat of the song long before the movie was even developed. In 2003, West performed a very early version of the song at the 2nd Annual Dynamic Producer Conference in New York City. West originally produced and recorded \"Gold Digger\" in Ludacris's home in Atlanta for Shawnna's 2004 debut album Worth Tha Weight and had written the chorus from a female first-person viewpoint: \"I'm not sayin' I'm a gold digger, but I ain't messin' with no broke niggas.\" However, for reasons unknown, Shawnna passed on using the song. Not wanting to let it go to waste, West decided to keep the beat for himself and add lyrics expressed from a male's point-of-view.\nThe second verse of \"Gold Digger\" was the first to be written, as West used to rap the verse in early 2004 while on tour promoting his debut album, The College Dropout. The first verse was made later in the year while West was on Usher's Evolution Tour. Lastly, the original third verse was taken from an unreleased song called \"Drop Dead Gorgeous,\" which West had produced and rapped on for Murphy Lee of St. Lunatics. About a year later, right before \"Gold Digger\" was set to be released as a single, West decided to write a different third verse and in a week the new song was recorded and mastered at Sony Music Studios in New York City.\nThe idea of employing Jamie Foxx specifically to sing an interpolation of Ray Charles' \"I Got a Woman\" in place of its initial sample did in fact arise from West seeing Ray with his friend John Mayer. Foxx's vocals were recorded over many takes; in one version he sang from start to finish, but the track was retracted as his performance didn't coincide well with the song's instrumentation. After recording another version, Foxx decided to re-record it once more as he felt it contained too many explicit lyrics. Once the track was finally in place, it was layered with additional instruments provided by American film score composer Jon Brion and individually selected by West. By the end of their very first studio session together, the pair had completed the basic tracks for the final version of \"Gold Digger\". Despite being a featured singer, Foxx's part only appears in the intro and the rest of the song uses West's vocals and samples of Charles.\n\"Gold Digger\" is a hip hop beat that contains samples (as well as an interpolation during the introduction) of \"I Got a Woman\" by Ray Charles, and a bouncy drum beat formed from handclaps and scratches by DJ A-Trak. Towards the end, the song employs vintage 1970s synthesizers which emit a honking sound in cadence to Kanye's voice. West delivers a tongue-in-cheek lyrical narrative within \"Gold Digger\" in which he critically depicts the disastrous life of a man married to a woman who manipulates him for financial gain. However, another story arises within the third verse, which illustrates a"

Warner Bros. Records released it on October 4, 1999, as the first single from Hill's fourth album of the same name (1999). The song was produced by Byron Gallimore and Hill. \"Breathe\" became Hill's seventh number one on the Hot Country Songs chart in the United States, spending six weeks at number one. It also peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in April 2000. Despite not peaking at number one, it was the number-one pop single of 2000.\nBill Lamb from About.com said that country singer Faith Hill \"leaned heavily in a pop direction\" on \"Breathe\". He described it as \"a classic power ballad\". In 2005, Blender ranked it at number 167 in their list of \"Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\". They described it as a \"swooning ballad [that] turns country gal into Mississippi queen.\" The Daily Vault's Alfredo Narvaez said it is a \"great song\", adding, \"if it is not a single already, it must be soon. This song is destined for the prom night halls and the wedding receptions of tomorrow. (Yeah, it's that good and strong.)\"\nOn October 4, 1999, \"Breathe\" was released US radio, and on February 8, 2000, it was issued as a physical single. The song spent six weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, seventeen weeks at number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, and one week at number one on the Adult Top 40 chart. The song also reached a peak of number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five non-consecutive weeks starting with the week ending April 22, 2000. It was kept off the top position by Santana's \"Maria Maria\" featuring The Product G&B and \"Try Again\" by Aaliyah.\nEven though \"Breathe\" never made it to number one on the weekly Billboard Hot 100 chart, it was on the chart for 53 weeks and named the number one single of 2000 on Billboard's year-end countdown. It was one of only three songs in the history of the Hot 100 to be named the number one single of the year without making it to the top of the chart on any of the weekly surveys. (The first was \"Wooly Bully\" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs in 1965, and the third was \"Hanging by a Moment\" by Lifehouse in 2001.)\nIn 2009, the single was named the twenty-seventh most-successful song of the 2000s, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.

The song features American rapper Lil Wayne who co-wrote the song alongside Hilson and Zachary Anson Wallace. Production credits are shared between Danja and Polow da Don, who also co-wrote the song. Following the minimal chart success of Hilson's worldwide lead single \"Energy\" in the United States, international markets received \"Return the Favor\", while \"Turnin Me On\" was released as the third single in the US.\nAfter experimenting with more pop-oriented music in her previous mentioned songs, Hilson opted for a more urban, hip-hop flavored sound for the song, due to her wanting to keep to her roots. While noting her less than stellar vocals on the track, critics praised Hilson's sassiness and attitude on the track and complimented Lil Wayne's verse, which has been called the best surprise rap since Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes on TLC's \"Waterfalls.\" The song's accompanying music video features intricate Aaliyah and \"Soldier\"-esque choreography, dance scenes such as the Bird Walk, and Hilson being flaunted by men. The scenes are intercut with mirror scenes with younger kids.\nThe song was a commercial success in the United States, reaching number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100, whilst reaching two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"Turnin Me On\" received two nominations at the 2009 BET Awards, and a \"Song of the Year\" nomination at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards. A leaked remix of the song caused controversy, with rumors that Hilson was taking shots at fellow female R&B singers Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Ciara; however, Hilson has fervently denied the rumors that it was a diss. Hilson performed the song as a part of a medley at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards and BET Awards.\nIn June 2008, Rap-Up originally reported the song as \"Turn Off\", while Hilson was playing it at Interscope-Geffen-A&M Records' second annual \"Creme of the Crop\" post-BET Awards dinner on June 25, 2008. Then an unmastered version of \"Turn Off\" was leaked online in September 2008. After selecting the predominantly pop-sounding \"Energy\" and \"Return the Favor\", Hilson selected \"Turnin Me On\" as In a Perfect World...'s third single. When asked in an interview with That Grape Juice if choosing the song was a conscious effort, since the song had a different sound than the previous singles, Hilson responded, \n\"Absolutely! I mean, there\u2019s another side of me. I\u2019m from Decatur, Georgia and that is a predominantly black neighbourhood with a lot of lower-class and some middle-class neighbourhoods. I guess that is the song that probably properly describes the type of girl I am, in relation to where I\u2019m from. So yeah, it was definitely a conscious effort to make sure that I stay close to home on some records.\"\nThe song is a futuristic-esque R&B, synth-driven, bass-heavy urban song, featuring \"bouncy\" horn samples. Written in the key of C minor the song is in a \"moderate R&B groove\". It is set in common time and Hilson's vocals span from the low note of G\u2083 to the high note of C\u2085 \" \"Turnin Me On\" is lyrically about physical attraction and composed in a hard-edged tone.\" MTV Buzzworthy described the song \"as one-part Rihanna 'Umbrella' and two parts Beyonc\u00e9 'Ring the Alarm'\"\nNaming it a standout track from In a Perfect World... Andy Kellman of AllMusic called the song a \"coquettish trunk rattler.\" Barry Walters of Spin complimented Hilson's \"sassiness\" on the song which she \"wore well.\" MTV Buzzworthy called the Wayne's verse \"the best surprise rap since Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes' verse in TLC's 'Waterfalls.'\" J.K. Glei of Cincinnati Metromix called the track \"playful\" and said the track was easily the album's standout, commenting that Lil Wayne's cameo \"steals the show.\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commended the song, calling it \"tight.\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said called the song \"slinky\"  and said, \"the busyness coheres, with Ms. Hilson neatly gliding among the song\u2019s many layers. And she may need the crutch; she is a careful, slight singer.\" Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times called the song \"impeccably arranged.\" After watching the video, a writer for BET Sound Off said after it seemed Hilson and her label were losing faith, that \"out of nowhere, Keri got her ish together\", and said, \"I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll regain the steam she lost"

It was released to US pop radio on February 16, 2021, as the seventh single  from the album, after it became a sleeper hit the previous month as a result of a TikTok challenge. The TikTok #SilhouetteChallenge rendered popular what is now called the \"Streets (Silhouette Remix)\" version, which includes a snippet of Paul Anka's 1959 hit song \"Put Your Head on My Shoulder\".\nThe song was written by Doja Cat, David Sprecher, Lydia Asrat, Theron Otis Feemster, Christopher Jefferies, and Demarie Sheki, produced by brother production duo Blaq Tuxedo, who are also credited as co-writers. The music video directed by Christian Breslauer was released on March 9, 2021, and contains references to the #SilhouetteChallenge and Spider-Man.\n\"Streets\" was written by Doja Cat, David Sprecher, Lydia Asrat, Theron Otis Feemster, Christopher Jefferies, Demarie Sheki, and song's producers of duo Blaq Tuxedo. It is a melancholy R&B ballad that lasts for a duration of three minutes and forty-seven seconds. The song gained its namesake from the song which is sampled throughout the track, \"Streets Is Callin\", by B2K from their soundtrack album You Got Served (2003).\nAccording to Billboard, Doja Cat's record label, RCA Records, saw \"Streets\" as a \"highlight\" of Hot Pink (2019), however \"they just never saw it becoming a hit.\" However, after gaining popularity on the video-sharing platform TikTok, \"Streets\" was released to US contemporary hit radio stations on February 16 as album's seventh single. Commenting on the single's release for Billboard, RCA Records COO John Fleckenstein said \"as we're seeing, clearly we have not. The fans are not done with it yet\", referring to that Doja Cat announced in September 2020 that she completed recording her third studio album.\nA remixed version of \"Streets\", containing the first 12 seconds from the 1959 Paul Anka hit \"Put Your Head on My Shoulder\" (previously sampled by Doja Cat herself on the song \"Freak\"), that gained attraction on TikTok, was released on March 12, dubbed as \"Silhouette Remix\".  It was released alongside a remix by Disclosure, which was later released to Russian radios. A week later, a remix EP was released, containing the Disclosure remix, and four other remixes by DJ Sliink, Lazerbeak, Party Favor, and Ape Drums.\nLakin Starling from Consequence of Sound said that in the song, Doja Cat is presenting most \"serious\" version of herself. According to Lucy Shanker of Pitchfork, \"Streets\" is one of tracks that showcases rapper's softness, adding \"It's not hard to picture her recording a ballad like \"Streets\" from within an all-pink lair.\"\n\nIn early 2021, \"Streets\" began to gain traction on streaming services following the Hot Pink Sessions performances, which further sparked traction on the video-sharing platform TikTok, where it has been used in over 180,000 videos as of January\u00a02021. The \"Silhouette Challenge\" that soon originated on the same platform would also later boost the song's popularity even more. It subsequently debuted at number 18 on the US Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart, moving up to a peak of number four. The next week, \"Streets\" debuted at number 91 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart issue dated January 23, 2021, becoming Doja Cat's eighth appearance on the chart. It propelled to number 39 in its second week, marking the second top-forty single from Hot Pink. The song reached a new peak of number 18 in its fourth week on the chart. After charting for 10 weeks, the song reached a new peak of number 16. Similarly, in Canada, \"Streets\" has peaked at number 19 on the Canadian Hot 100, earning Doja Cat her second top-twenty entry in the country.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Streets\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number 59 on the week ending January 21, 2021. It ascended up to number 20 the following week, earning Doja Cat her third top-twenty entry in the country following \"Say So\", and \"Motive\" with Ariana Grande, both in 2020. The song has reached number 12 there, while reaching a peak of number four on the UK R&B Chart. In Ireland, \"Streets\" debuted at number 61 on the Irish Singles Chart, where it moved up to number 22 in its second week. The song has moved up to a peak of number nine, becoming her third top-ten single there.\nThe track also entered charts in Oceania; it charted on the"

Allen\nDavid L. Conley\nOlivia Longott\nQuincy Q. Patrick\nJuan \"Magic\" Peters\nJoshua P. Thompson. \"Bizounce\" is the debut single recorded by American singer Olivia, from her self-titled debut studio album  (2001). Producers Doug Allen and Joshua Thompson wrote the song in collaboration with Olivia and songwriters David L. Conley, Quincy Q. Patrick, and Juan Magic\" Peters. It was released on March 20, 2001 as the lead single from the album. It is an upbeat, R&B track with lyrics that revolve around dissatisfaction with a relationship and the desire to \"bizounce\" or leave the partner. In her autobiography, Release Me: My Life, My Words, Olivia revealed her disappointment that \"Bizounce\" was chosen and released as the lead single because of interference by label executives.\n\"Bizounce\" received primarily mixed reviews from music critics; some critics praised Olivia's vocals, image, and its choice as her debut single while others questioned Olivia's connection with the music. The single was a commercial success in the United States, peaking at number fifteen on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number four on the U.S. Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks charts. It also peaked at number sixteen on the Canadian Singles Chart. \"Bizounce\" is Olivia's most successful solo single, leaving her 2005 collaboration with rapper 50 Cent on \"Candy Shop\" as her most successful overall. To promote \"Bizounce\", she performed it on various television and live shows. She also included the song as a part of the promotional tour leading up the album's release. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Marcus Raboy.\nOlivia initially performed rap under the name \"O-Lovely\", before abandoning it to attend Hofstra University and Five Towns College as a different way to advance her career in music. Olivia recalled that people frequently compared her voice to Brandy. Olivia was signed to J Record at age 17, becoming the first artist to join the record label. For her audition, she performed the gospel hymn \"His Eye Is on the Sparrow\" for American record producer Clive Davis. During an interview with Billboard, Olivia revealed that she was immediately signed to the label following the meeting. She described herself as \"the one chosen to flagship the label\" since her single and album were one of the first projects released by the company. Executives from the record company referred to her as \"the First Lady of J\".\nJoshua Thompson, who previously arranged for Olivia's audition for Arista Records' executives and Davis, produced her demo. \"Bizounce\" was produced by Thompson and Doug Allen, who also contributed to the writing along with Olivia, David L. Conley, Quincy Q. Patrick, and Juan Magic\" Peters. J\u00a0Records senior vice president Ron Gillyard described Olivia as \"the real deal\", emphasizing her roles as \"a songwriter, a singer, and a rapper\". Olivia later described the recording and promotion of \"Bizounce\" and the album as a learning experience for her future ventures; she said her time at J Records was: \"cut short by the politics of the industry and me not actually taking my career into my own hands\". She said record executives took away her control over the creation of the album because of her youth and inexperience.\nAccording to digital information from Beatport, \"Bizounce\" is a R&B and funk song composed in the key of G minor. An overview from AllMusic described it as a rap and electronic song with elements of dance and Hi-NRG music. The song's instrumentation is composed of drums, keyboards, and a bass guitar. AllMusic's Jon Azpiri praised the contrast between the \"brutally frank\" lyrics about break-ups and infidelity, and the \"seductive\" instrumentals, making the single one of the most memorable of 2001. According to a review in Billboard, Olivia's vocal performance reflects her hip hop influences and gives the single a \"street edge\" while its \"orchestral tinges\" are best-suited for R&B radio.\nIn an interview with Billboard, Olivia called the single an \"empowering women's song\" for inspiring women to leave unfulfilling relationships. She said she wrote it: \"for all the people who don't know how to tell the other"

It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon\u2013McCartney partnership. The single was the Beatles' first release on their Apple record label and one of the \"First Four\" singles by Apple's roster of artists, marking the label's public launch. \"Hey Jude\" was a number-one hit in many countries around the world and became the year's top-selling single in the UK, the US, Australia and Canada. Its nine-week run at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 tied the all-time record in 1968 for the longest run at the top of the US charts, a record it held for nine years. It has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on music critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time.\nThe writing and recording of \"Hey Jude\" coincided with a period of upheaval in the Beatles. The ballad evolved from \"Hey Jules\", a song McCartney wrote to comfort John Lennon's son, Julian, after Lennon had left his wife for the Japanese artist Yoko Ono. The lyrics espouse a positive outlook on a sad situation, while also encouraging \"Jude\" to pursue his opportunities to find love. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a coda featuring a \"Na-na-na na\" refrain that lasts for over four minutes.\n\"Hey Jude\" was the first Beatles song to be recorded on eight-track recording equipment. The sessions took place at Trident Studios in central London, midway through the recording of the group's self-titled double album (also known as the \"White Album\"), and led to an argument between McCartney and George Harrison over the song's guitar part. Ringo Starr later left the band only to return shortly before they filmed the promotional clip for the single. The clip was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg and first aired on David Frost's UK television show. Contrasting with the problems afflicting the band, this performance captured the song's theme of optimism and togetherness by featuring the studio audience joining the Beatles as they sang the coda.\nAt over seven minutes in length, \"Hey Jude\" was the longest single to top the British charts up to that time. Its arrangement and extended coda encouraged many imitative works through to the early 1970s. In 2013, Billboard magazine named it the 10th \"biggest\" song of all time in terms of chart success. McCartney has continued to perform \"Hey Jude\" in concert since Lennon's death in 1980, leading audiences in singing the coda. Julian Lennon and McCartney have each bid successfully at auction for items of memorabilia related to the song's creation.\nIn May 1968, John Lennon and his wife Cynthia separated due to his affair with Japanese artist Yoko Ono. The following month, Paul McCartney drove out to visit the Lennons' five-year-old son Julian, at Kenwood, the family's home in Weybridge. Cynthia had been part of the Beatles' social circle since before the band's rise to fame in 1963; McCartney later said he found it \"a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life\". Cynthia Lennon recalled of McCartney's surprise visit: \"I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.\" The song's original title was \"Hey Jules\", and it was intended to comfort Julian from the stress of his parents' separation. McCartney said, \"I knew it was not going to be easy for him\", and that he changed the name to \"Jude\" \"because I thought that sounded a bit better\".\nAccording to music journalist Chris Hunt, in the weeks after writing the song, McCartney \"test[ed] his latest composition on anyone too polite to refuse. And that meant everyone.\" On 30 June, after recording the Black Dyke Mills Band's rendition of his instrumental \"Thingumybob\" in Yorkshire, McCartney stopped at the village of Harrold in Bedfordshire and performed \"Hey Jude\" at a local pub. He also regaled members of the Bonzo Dog Band with the song while producing their single \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\", in London, and interrupted a recording session by the Barron Knights to do the same. Ron Griffith of the group the Iveys \u2013 soon to be known as Badfinger and, like the Black Dyke Mills Band, an early signing to the Beatles' new record label Apple Records \u2013 recalled that on one of their first days in the studio, McCartney \"gave us a full concert rendition of 'Hey Jude'\".\nThe intensity of Lennon and Ono's relationship made any songwriting"

The song's accompanying music video, which takes place in a desert and features a countdown clock in conjunction with the song's meaning, was received warmly, and according to critics, was an end to the low-budget, storyline-centered, debut music videos from previous American Idol alumni.\nThe song had been recorded by Irish band The Script as a bonus track for the Japanese release of their self-titled debut album and a B-side track for their debut single \"We Cry\" in Australia, Finland, Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland.\nIn an interview with MTV News, Allen stated that the song had been earmarked as his album's potential single since he won American Idol back in May 2009. Allen stated, \"[The song] was actually one that we had listened to really early on, and we kind of just fell in love with it. Everyone did.\" When an interview for his cover story shared with, Idol runner-up, Adam Lambert, Allen explained, \"It's a song that has a really good message-that we only have so much time, let's make the most of it. It's definitely got one of the choruses where I can picture people rolling down the windows of their cars and singing along to it.\"\n\nAfter the success of the single, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Allen said, \n\"It took a while, but it\u2019s done really incredible. It exceeded all my expectations anyway. To be honest, I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn\u2019t doing great. But I think it\u2019s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I\u2019m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn\u2019t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that\u2019s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that\u2019s a testament to a good song. You don\u2019t have to love \u2018em the first time you hear \u2018em. It grew on people.\"\n\"Live Like We're Dying\" is described to be in a \"moderate pop rock\" groove, and consisting of \"shuffly\" guitar playing. The song has been referred to as \"danceable\", and the chorus as \"grooving\" and \"syncopated\". It is written in the key of C major and Allen's vocals span from G\u2083 to A\u2084. The song contains inspirational lyrics, as Allen gives a \"muscular\" and \"engaged\" vocal performance, and delivers the lines in a rhythmic fashion. According to Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly, the song contains new-age sentiments.\nBill Lamb of About.com praised the song for being an excellent first single, calling it \"possibly the best first post-American Idol single yet by an American Idol champion\" and stating that it \"could appeal to a massive audience\".  He also applauded the song's \"outstanding, inspirational lyrics\" and Allen's vocal performance. Entertainment Weekly''s Michael Slezak called the song \"a future smash hit\" and described it as \"downright verbose \u2013 packing in some sweet, new-age-y sentiments about existing in the moment, living without regret, and saying 'I love you' early and often to the people in our lives\".  He stated that rather than being clich\u00e9 the song's lyrics are \"winningly inspirational thanks to the conviction in Kris\u2019 vocals\".  Yahoo! News described it as \"impressive\" and felt that Allen's version of the song \"improves on the unreleased version with a nuanced vocal and a nimble, rhythmic delivery\".  Monica Herrera of Billboard said that Allen \"improves\" the Script's version \"with a nuanced vocal and a nimble, rhythmic delivery\". Herrera also stated that \"Allen still seems \"emboldened by the risks he took on Idol\" and that his fans \"should be feeling the same after hearing the first track from his November 17 debut.\"\nJames Montgomery of MTV News said that the song seemed \"tailor-made\" for him, playing on the strengths"

(We All Shine On)\") is a song by English rock musician John Lennon, released as a single on Apple Records in February 1970. The lyric focuses on a concept in which the causality of one's actions is immediate rather than borne out over a lifetime. The single was credited to \"Lennon/Ono with the Plastic Ono Band\", apart from in the US, where the credit was \"John Ono Lennon\". The song reached the top five in the British and American singles charts, competing with the Beatles' \"Let It Be\" in the US, where it became the first solo single by a member of the band to sell a million copies.\n\"Instant Karma!\" was conceived, written, recorded and released within a period of ten days, making it one of the fastest-released songs in pop music history. The recording was produced by Phil Spector, marking a comeback for the American producer after his self-imposed retirement in 1966, and leading to him being offered the producer's role on the Beatles' Let It Be album. Recorded at London's Abbey Road Studios, \"Instant Karma!\" employs Spector's signature Wall of Sound technique and features contributions from George Harrison, Klaus Voormann, Alan White and Billy Preston. The B-side was \"Who Has Seen the Wind?\", a song composed and performed by Ono. When released in the US, the single was given a minor remix by Spector.\nRecently shorn of the long hair synonymous with their 1969 campaign for world peace, Lennon and Ono promoted the single with an appearance on Britain's Top of the Pops five days after its release. The song received positive reviews and is considered by some music critics to be among the finest recordings from Lennon's solo career. A live performance recorded at his and Ono's \"One to One\" concerts in August 1972 was included on the posthumously released Live in New York City (1986). Paul Weller, Duran Duran and U2 are among the acts who have covered \"Instant Karma!\" Its chorus also inspired the title to Stephen King's 1977 novel The Shining.\nTogether with his wife, Yoko Ono, John Lennon spent New Year 1970 in Aalborg, Denmark, establishing a relationship with Ono's former husband, artist Tony Cox, and visiting Cox and Ono's daughter Kyoko. The visit coincided with the start of what Lennon termed \"Year 1 AP (After Peace)\", following his and Ono's heavily publicised Bed-Ins and other peace-campaign activities throughout 1969. To mark the new era, on 20 January 1970, the couple shaved off their shoulder-length hair \u2013 an act that Britain's Daily Mirror described as \"the most sensational scalpings since the Red Indians went out of business\". Having been recognised for his peace efforts in a segment on ITV's Man of the Decade documentary, and then chosen as Rolling Stone magazine's \"Man of the Year\" for 1969, Lennon said he cut his hair to \"stop being hyped by revolutionary image and long hair\". Lennon and Ono promised to auction the shorn hair for a charitable cause. This pledge followed the couple's announcement, on 5 January, that they would donate all future royalties from their recordings to the peace movement.\nWhile in Denmark, the Lennons, Cox and the latter's current partner, Melinde Kendall, discussed the concept of \"instant karma\", whereby the causality of one's actions is immediate rather than borne out over a lifetime. Author Philip Norman writes of the concept's appeal: \"The idea was quintessential Lennon \u2013 the age-old Buddhist law of cause and effect turned into something as modern and synthetic as instant coffee and, simultaneously, into a bogey under the stairs that can get you if you don't watch out.\" On 27 January, two days after returning to the UK, Lennon woke up with the beginnings of a song inspired by his conversations with Cox and Kendall. Working at home on a piano, he developed the idea and came up with a melody for the composition, which he titled \"Instant Karma!\"\nLennon completed the writing of \"Instant Karma!\" in an hour. Eager to record the song immediately, he then telephoned his Beatles bandmate George Harrison and American producer Phil Spector, who was in London at the invitation of Allen Klein, the manager of the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation. According to Lennon's recollection, he told Spector: \"Come over to Apple quick, I've just written a monster.\"\nThe song employs a descending three-note melodic progression"

It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon\u2013McCartney partnership. The single was the Beatles' first release on their Apple record label and one of the \"First Four\" singles by Apple's roster of artists, marking the label's public launch. \"Hey Jude\" was a number-one hit in many countries around the world and became the year's top-selling single in the UK, the US, Australia and Canada. Its nine-week run at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 tied the all-time record in 1968 for the longest run at the top of the US charts, a record it held for nine years. It has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on music critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time.\nThe writing and recording of \"Hey Jude\" coincided with a period of upheaval in the Beatles. The ballad evolved from \"Hey Jules\", a song McCartney wrote to comfort John Lennon's son, Julian, after Lennon had left his wife for the Japanese artist Yoko Ono. The lyrics espouse a positive outlook on a sad situation, while also encouraging \"Jude\" to pursue his opportunities to find love. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a coda featuring a \"Na-na-na na\" refrain that lasts for over four minutes.\n\"Hey Jude\" was the first Beatles song to be recorded on eight-track recording equipment. The sessions took place at Trident Studios in central London, midway through the recording of the group's self-titled double album (also known as the \"White Album\"), and led to an argument between McCartney and George Harrison over the song's guitar part. Ringo Starr later left the band only to return shortly before they filmed the promotional clip for the single. The clip was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg and first aired on David Frost's UK television show. Contrasting with the problems afflicting the band, this performance captured the song's theme of optimism and togetherness by featuring the studio audience joining the Beatles as they sang the coda.\nAt over seven minutes in length, \"Hey Jude\" was the longest single to top the British charts up to that time. Its arrangement and extended coda encouraged many imitative works through to the early 1970s. In 2013, Billboard magazine named it the 10th \"biggest\" song of all time in terms of chart success. McCartney has continued to perform \"Hey Jude\" in concert since Lennon's death in 1980, leading audiences in singing the coda. Julian Lennon and McCartney have each bid successfully at auction for items of memorabilia related to the song's creation.\nIn May 1968, John Lennon and his wife Cynthia separated due to his affair with Japanese artist Yoko Ono. The following month, Paul McCartney drove out to visit the Lennons' five-year-old son Julian, at Kenwood, the family's home in Weybridge. Cynthia had been part of the Beatles' social circle since before the band's rise to fame in 1963; McCartney later said he found it \"a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life\". Cynthia Lennon recalled of McCartney's surprise visit: \"I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.\" The song's original title was \"Hey Jules\", and it was intended to comfort Julian from the stress of his parents' separation. McCartney said, \"I knew it was not going to be easy for him\", and that he changed the name to \"Jude\" \"because I thought that sounded a bit better\".\nAccording to music journalist Chris Hunt, in the weeks after writing the song, McCartney \"test[ed] his latest composition on anyone too polite to refuse. And that meant everyone.\" On 30 June, after recording the Black Dyke Mills Band's rendition of his instrumental \"Thingumybob\" in Yorkshire, McCartney stopped at the village of Harrold in Bedfordshire and performed \"Hey Jude\" at a local pub. He also regaled members of the Bonzo Dog Band with the song while producing their single \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\", in London, and interrupted a recording session by the Barron Knights to do the same. Ron Griffith of the group the Iveys \u2013 soon to be known as Badfinger and, like the Black Dyke Mills Band, an early signing to the Beatles' new record label Apple Records \u2013 recalled that on one of their first days in the studio, McCartney \"gave us a full concert rendition of 'Hey Jude'\".\nThe intensity of Lennon and Ono's relationship made any songwriting"

A second version of the video without a guest appearance from Ludacris, was released on 2 December 2010.\nThroughout the video, it shows tinted lighting and fast-paced graphics. The video features close-up shots of Mauboy singing the song wearing a blue dress and large rounded earrings, with much makeup. There are also intercut snippets of a DB9 driving swiftly along a highway with a license plate reading \"JP Logistics\", an anonymous dancer on a bar seat with curly hair, and city scenes including neon signage. Mauboy herself can be seen wearing a fox fur and dancing at a club with some girlfriends, while holding a glass of champagne, and a bottle of alcohol is also pictured. Ludacris makes a cameo appearance, raising his sunglasses to reveal himself in the beginning and illuminating the neon lighting with his hands in his rap solo. The video ends with Mauboy and her girlfriends parking their DB9 and getting out, and she is wearing a sparkling dress and a cap.\nEditors from MusicFix were impressed with the video and wrote that, \"Mauboy gets sexier in each"

Its nine-week run at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 tied the all-time record in 1968 for the longest run at the top of the US charts, a record it held for nine years. It has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on music critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time.\nThe writing and recording of \"Hey Jude\" coincided with a period of upheaval in the Beatles.

The sessions took place at Trident Studios in central London, midway through the recording of the group's self-titled double album (also known as the \"White Album\"), and led to an argument between McCartney and George Harrison over the song's guitar part. Ringo Starr later left the band only to return shortly before they filmed the promotional clip for the single.

Its arrangement and extended coda encouraged many imitative works through to the early 1970s. In 2013, Billboard magazine named it the 10th \"biggest\" song of all time in terms of chart success. McCartney has continued to perform \"Hey Jude\" in concert since Lennon's death in 1980, leading audiences in singing the coda. Julian Lennon and McCartney have each bid successfully at auction for items of memorabilia related to the song's creation.\nIn May 1968, John Lennon and his wife Cynthia separated due to his affair with Japanese artist Yoko Ono. The following month, Paul McCartney drove out to visit the Lennons' five-year-old son Julian, at Kenwood, the family's home in Weybridge. Cynthia had been part of the Beatles' social circle since before the band's rise to fame in 1963; McCartney later said he found it \"a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life\".

It was written by Martin, Aaron Pearce, Jeremy Hunter, Keith Ross, Gavriel Avinov and Pitbull who is also featured with a rap verse. \"Mr Put It Down\" is a dance-pop song with a club and disco influence and elements from the 1970s and 1980s musical styles. Critics compared the song to the works by several music artists such as Michael Jackson, Earth, Wind & Fire and Justin Timberlake. To deliver the lyrics, Martin uses processed vocals and his falsetto. Following its release it charted on the Wallonia Ultratip chart at number 19 and Ultratop Wallonia Dance chart at number 31. In Billboard's July 4, 2015 issue, it reached number one on the Dance Club Songs chart. \"Mr. Put It Down\" served as the opener on Martin's 2015 One World Tour.\n\"Mr. Put It Down\" was written by Ricky Martin, Aaron Pearce, Jeremy Hunter, Keith Ross, Gavriel Avinov and Armando P\u00e9rez.  It was digitally released on March 11, 2015 via the iTunes Store. In the United Kingdom, it was released on May 24, 2015.\n\"Mr. Put It Down\" is a \"funky\" pop song with a length of three minutes and sixteen seconds. According to Mike Wass of Idolator, the song is a \"raunchy club-banger\" and \"disco-flavored jam\" that lasts for three minutes and sixteen seconds. Andrew Le of Renowned for Sound described the single as \"unashamedly party song\" that channels the music \"glory days\" of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Le wrote that \"Mr. Put It Down\" features slick, thick and funky arrangements which according to him are inspired by the works of the band Earth Wind & Fire and singers Prince and Michael Jackson. He also noted that the song contains groovy synthesizers and guitar licks with which help reminiscents of \"Working Day and Night\" (performed by Jackson, 1979) and \"Let's Groove\" (performed by Earth Wind & Fire, 1981).\nWass described \"Mr. Put It Down\" as a musical combination of the 2013 single \"Take Back the Night\" by American singer Justin Timberlake and the 2014 song by Austin Mahone, \"Mmm Yeah\" on which Pitbull is featured as well. It begins with a rap verse by Pitbull who brags about his relationship with women. The chorus of the song, features Martin singing the lyrics, \"\u201cWho has a lifetime, baby? We've got the night right now. When you see what I\u2019m planning, you're gonna call me Mr. Put It Down.\". Martin's vocals in the song are processed and he uses his falsetto to deliver the lyrics. Between Martin's parts, Pitbull talks the lines \"Pitbull such a dawg\" and \"give me that uh!\". Le also found \"remarkable\" that the rapper managed to rhyme, \"lust can get tricky\" with \"Ricky\".\n\nAndrew Le of Renowned for Sound gave the song two out of five stars and wrote that Martin and Pitbull are a \"mismatch\" on \"Mr. Put It Down\". According to him Martin has a much better party songs such as the 1998 single \"The Cup of Life\". He wrote that the single \"is a warning for listeners not to put down their drinks and get on the dance floor, but for Pitbull and Martin to put down any plans of sequels.\"\nWith \"Mr. Put It Down\", Martin earned his first number one hit on the US Dance Club Songs chart, in June 2015. It became his seventh top 10 and ninth song to chart overall on Billboard's Dance Club Songs.\nFollowing its release, \"Mr. Put It Down\" also reached number 91 on the Australian Singles Charts and charted in Belgium Wallonia, peaking at number 19 on Ultratip and number 28 on the Ultratop Dance chart.\nMartin performed the song on the American Idol final on May 12, 2015. He then performed it on Britain's Got Talent on May 25, 2015.

It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. When issued as a single in May 1970, a month after the Beatles' break-up, it became the group's 20th and last number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.\nThe main recording of the song took place in January 1969 and featured a sparse musical arrangement. When preparing the tapes from these sessions for release in April 1970, producer Phil Spector added orchestral and choral overdubs. Spector's modifications angered McCartney to the point that when the latter made his case in the English High Court for the Beatles' disbandment, he cited the treatment of \"The Long and Winding Road\" as one of six reasons for doing so. New versions of the song with simpler instrumentation were subsequently released by McCartney and by the Beatles.\nIn 2011, Rolling Stone ranked \"The Long and Winding Road\" at number 90 on their list of 100 greatest Beatles songs.\nPaul McCartney said he came up with the title \"The Long and Winding Road\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \"stretching up into the hills\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\"\nOnce back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \"The Long and Winding Road\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \"Without Love\" as a single.\nThe composition takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \"slightly jazzy\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. The opening theme is repeated throughout. The song lacks a traditional chorus, and the melody and lyrics are ambiguous about the opening stanza's position in the piece. In this way, according to musicologist Alan Pollack, it is unclear whether the song has just begun, is in the verse, or is in the bridge.\nIn an interview in 1994, McCartney said of \"The Long and Winding Road\": \"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\" He also told his biographer Barry Miles in the 1990s that the song was \"all about the unattainable; the door you never quite reach ... the road that you never get to the end of\".\n\nMcCartney premiered \"The Long and Winding Road\" on 7 January 1969 during the Beatles' filmed rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios. After they abandoned thoughts of returning to public performance, and instead decided to make a new album, the band recorded several takes of the song at their Apple Studio in central London on 26 January and again on 31 January. The line-up was McCartney on lead vocals and piano, John Lennon on six-string bass guitar, George Harrison on electric guitar played with a Leslie speaker effect, Ringo Starr on drums, and guest keyboardist Billy Preston on electric piano. Lennon, usually the band's rhythm guitarist, made several mistakes on the recording.\nIn May 1969, Glyn Johns, who had been asked by the Beatles to compile and mix the Get Back album from the sessions, selected the 26 January recording. The 31 January take, which had slightly different lyrics and was recorded with Johns in an unofficial producer's role, was used in the film, subsequently titled Let It Be.\nIn early 1970, Lennon and Harrison asked the Beatles'"

It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon\u2013McCartney partnership. The single was the Beatles' first release on their Apple record label and one of the \"First Four\" singles by Apple's roster of artists, marking the label's public launch. \"Hey Jude\" was a number-one hit in many countries around the world and became the year's top-selling single in the UK, the US, Australia and Canada. Its nine-week run at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 tied the all-time record in 1968 for the longest run at the top of the US charts, a record it held for nine years. It has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on music critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time.\nThe writing and recording of \"Hey Jude\" coincided with a period of upheaval in the Beatles. The ballad evolved from \"Hey Jules\", a song McCartney wrote to comfort John Lennon's son, Julian, after Lennon had left his wife for the Japanese artist Yoko Ono. The lyrics espouse a positive outlook on a sad situation, while also encouraging \"Jude\" to pursue his opportunities to find love. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a coda featuring a \"Na-na-na na\" refrain that lasts for over four minutes.\n\"Hey Jude\" was the first Beatles song to be recorded on eight-track recording equipment. The sessions took place at Trident Studios in central London, midway through the recording of the group's self-titled double album (also known as the \"White Album\"), and led to an argument between McCartney and George Harrison over the song's guitar part. Ringo Starr later left the band only to return shortly before they filmed the promotional clip for the single. The clip was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg and first aired on David Frost's UK television show. Contrasting with the problems afflicting the band, this performance captured the song's theme of optimism and togetherness by featuring the studio audience joining the Beatles as they sang the coda.\nAt over seven minutes in length, \"Hey Jude\" was the longest single to top the British charts up to that time. Its arrangement and extended coda encouraged many imitative works through to the early 1970s. In 2013, Billboard magazine named it the 10th \"biggest\" song of all time in terms of chart success. McCartney has continued to perform \"Hey Jude\" in concert since Lennon's death in 1980, leading audiences in singing the coda. Julian Lennon and McCartney have each bid successfully at auction for items of memorabilia related to the song's creation.\nIn May 1968, John Lennon and his wife Cynthia separated due to his affair with Japanese artist Yoko Ono. The following month, Paul McCartney drove out to visit the Lennons' five-year-old son Julian, at Kenwood, the family's home in Weybridge. Cynthia had been part of the Beatles' social circle since before the band's rise to fame in 1963; McCartney later said he found it \"a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life\". Cynthia Lennon recalled of McCartney's surprise visit: \"I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.\" The song's original title was \"Hey Jules\", and it was intended to comfort Julian from the stress of his parents' separation. McCartney said, \"I knew it was not going to be easy for him\", and that he changed the name to \"Jude\" \"because I thought that sounded a bit better\".\nAccording to music journalist Chris Hunt, in the weeks after writing the song, McCartney \"test[ed] his latest composition on anyone too polite to refuse. And that meant everyone.\" On 30 June, after recording the Black Dyke Mills Band's rendition of his instrumental \"Thingumybob\" in Yorkshire, McCartney stopped at the village of Harrold in Bedfordshire and performed \"Hey Jude\" at a local pub. He also regaled members of the Bonzo Dog Band with the song while producing their single \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\", in London, and interrupted a recording session by the Barron Knights to do the same. Ron Griffith of the group the Iveys \u2013 soon to be known as Badfinger and, like the Black Dyke Mills Band, an early signing to the Beatles' new record label Apple Records \u2013 recalled that on one of their first days in the studio, McCartney \"gave us a full concert rendition of 'Hey Jude'\".\nThe intensity of Lennon and Ono's relationship made any songwriting"

It was written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon based on McCartney's original idea. The song was released in the United Kingdom in December 1964 on the album Beatles for Sale. In the United States, it was first issued as a single in February 1965 before appearing on the North American release Beatles VI. The song was the band's seventh number 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100, a run of US chart success achieved in just over a year. The single was also number 1 in Canada, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nThe Beatles recorded \"Eight Days a Week\" at EMI Studios in London in October 1964. The track opens with a fade-in, marking the first time that this technique had been used on a pop studio recording. The song was reissued worldwide in 2000 on the Beatles compilation album 1. It also provided the title for director Ron Howard's 2016 documentary film on the band's years as live performers, The Beatles: Eight Days a Week.\nPaul McCartney has attributed the inspiration of the song to at least two different sources. In a 1984 interview with Playboy magazine, he credited the title to one of Ringo Starr's malapropisms, which similarly provided titles for the Lennon\u2013McCartney songs \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Tomorrow Never Knows\". McCartney recalled: \"He said it as though he were an overworked chauffeur: 'Eight days a week.' When we heard it, we said, 'Really? Bing! Got it!'\"\nMcCartney subsequently credited the title to an actual chauffeur who once drove him to Lennon's house in Weybridge. In the Beatles Anthology book, he states: \"I usually drove myself there, but the chauffeur drove me out that day and I said, 'How've you been?' \u2013 'Oh working hard,' he said, 'working eight days a week.'\" In a 2016 interview alongside Starr and Ron Howard, in preparation for the release of the documentary The Beatles: Eight Days a Week \u2013 The Touring Years, McCartney reiterated that he had heard it from a chauffeur who was driving him to Lennon's house while he was banned from driving. Starr has said he is not the source of the phrase.\n\"Eight Days a Week\" was the first song that the Beatles took into the studio unfinished to work on the arrangement during the session, a practice that would become common for the band. The song was recorded on 6 October 1964 during two sessions that together lasted nearly seven hours, with a fifteen-minute break in between. The band tried out several ideas for the intro and outro of the song. The first take featured a simple acoustic guitar introduction. The second take introduced an \"oo\"-ing vocal that was experimented with until the sixth take, when it was abandoned in favour of a guitar intro. The final outro (along with unused intro takes) was recorded separately, on 18 October.\nThe completed song incorporated another Beatles' first, in that it begins with a fade-in. \"Eight Days a Week\" marked the first time that a fade-in had been used to open a pop song. The instrumentation on the track consists of acoustic guitar, electric guitar, drums, bass and overdubbed handclaps. The fade-in and coda both include guitar overdubs, played by George Harrison on his Rickenbacker 12-string.\n\"Eight Days a Week\" was released on Beatles for Sale on 4 December 1964. It was sequenced as the opening track on side two of the LP. Describing the unusual effect provided by the fade-in, particularly at the start of an LP side, author Mark Hertsgaard writes that it gave listeners \"the sensation of hearing the music before the song actually arrived; it was as if the sound arose out of the distance, like a flock of migrating birds that suddenly fills the sky.\"\nThe song, along with two others from the album (\"Baby's in Black\" and \"No Reply\"), was considered for a single release. In the end, it was released as a single in the United States on 15 February 1965 (as Capitol 5371), becoming a number-one hit (their seventh in that country). The B-side was \"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\". The single release in the US was the result of DJs playing the song from imported copies of the Beatles for Sale album as an exclusive since it did not appear on the album's US counterpart, Beatles '65, nor did the B-side. Both tracks were included on the North American album Beatles VI, released in June 1965.\n\"Eight Days a Week\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry"

The song was written by Maurizio Bassi and Naimy Hackett, and released in 1985 as the lead single from Baltimora's debut album Living in the Background. The song was re-recorded and released in 1993, and has been covered by several artists throughout the years.\nThe refrain uses Tarzan's cry as a melodic line. The song is rhythmical, with an electronic melody and simple lyrics. Baltimora are often considered a one-hit wonder due to the success they experienced with \"Tarzan Boy\". It features what was later named the millennial whoop.\nThe music video for the song does not feature either Bassi or Hackett. Instead it features the front man for the band's performances, Jimmy McShane, who did not actually sing the song but rather lip synced it.\nThe song is currently used by Jungle Boy, a wrestler for AEW (All Elite Wrestling), as his entrance music.\n\"Tarzan Boy\" was an international hit, debuting in the top five Italian charts and performing well in several other European countries, including Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, and notably, France, where \"Tarzan Boy\" was most successful, topping the charts there for five consecutive weeks. In the United Kingdom, it reached number 3 in September 1985. The single had success in the United States (where it was released by EMI), with the single remaining on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six months and ultimately peaking at number 13 in early 1986.\nThe single \"Tarzan Boy\" bounced back into the Billboard Hot 100 chart in March 1993 as a remix, climbing to No. 51, at the time of its appearance in a Listerine commercial. The song was also featured in the films Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993), Beverly Hills Ninja (1997) and was then referenced in A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014).\n\n7\" single\n\"Tarzan Boy\" \u2013 3:48\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (DJ version) \u2013 3:36\n12\" single\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended version) \u2013 6:15\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (DJ version) \u2013 5:09\n12\" maxi\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dance version) \u2013 6:16\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (single version) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub version) \u2013 5:10\n12\" maxi \u2013 Summer version\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (Summer version) \u2013 6:40\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (reprise) \u2013 6:00\nCD single\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\n12\" single\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (UK swing mix) \u2013 3:18\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub) \u2013 5:10\nCD maxi\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended 1993 remix) \u2013 5:33\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub mix) \u2013 5:10\nCassette\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\nCD maxi \u2013 Promo\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:45\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:46\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended 1993 remix) \u2013 5:35\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (UK swing mix) \u2013 3:21\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub) \u2013 5:01\nStreaming single\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (Digital Remaster) \u2013 3:49\n\n\n\n\nIn 1989, the Hindi song \"Aaya Mausam Dosti Ka\", from the Bollywood soundtrack for the film Maine Pyar Kiya was heavily influenced by \"Tarzan Boy\".\nIn 2006, the song was covered by Bango, and achieved a minor success, peaking at number 37 in France.\nIn 2008, a cover by Bad Influence featuring Dyce reached number 9 in Sweden.\nList of Dutch Top 40 number-one singles of 1985\nList of European number-one hits of 1985\nList of number-one singles of 1985 (France)\nList of number-one singles of 1985 (Spain)\nEddy, Chuck (8 July 2013). \"Disco 101: Real '80S Italo\".

It was released as the fourth single from the album on October 24, 1989 by Sire Records. The song was not released as a single in most European territories until December 24, 1995, when it appeared on the 1995 ballads compilation Something to Remember. Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, the nexus of \"Oh Father\" was the presence of male authoritative figures in Madonna's life, most prominently her father, Tony Ciccone. Madonna's relationship with her father had soured after her mother's death in 1963 and his remarriage two years later. While developing the Like a Prayer album, Madonna was in an emotional state of mind due to her personal problems, which is reflected in \"Oh Father\".\nMusically, \"Oh Father\" is a baroque pop ballad. It was recorded at a studio in the Garment District of New York City. Leonard put together different types of chord progression and created the basic outline of a melody, which Madonna shaped and then wrote lyrics to fit the melody. She used a contrast of timbre while singing the song, which also featured instrumentation from strings, piano, violin and drums. \"Oh Father\" received positive reviews from critics and authors, but commercially was less successful than Madonna's previous singles. In most of the countries where it was released, the song failed to attain top-ten positions, except in Finland, where it peaked at number six. It ended Madonna's string of 16 consecutive top five singles in the United States.\nThe music video of the song was Madonna's attempt to embrace and accept her mother's death. Directed by David Fincher and shot in black-and-white, it shows a little girl playing in the snow, as her mother dies. A grown-up Madonna follows the child and sings the song, as the child runs away from her abusive father. Described by reviewers as \"autobiographical\", the video was listed by Rolling Stone as one of \"The 100 Top Music Videos\". Scholars noted how Madonna's persona was split into the child and adult in the video, and one writer described a scene involving the dead mother shown in her wake, with her lips sewn shut, as one of the most disturbing scenes in the history of mainstream music videos\u2014the scene was inspired by Madonna's memory of her mother from her funeral. \"Oh Father\" was performed only on the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, where Madonna portrayed a woman trying to find her religion and her battle for it.\nWhen Madonna was five years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone (whom Madonna was named after), died of breast cancer at the age of\u00a030. Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's behavior and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. \"I remember feeling stronger than she was\", Madonna recalled, \"I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child.\" Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. \"There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.\u00a0... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also.\"\nMadonna eventually learned to take care of herself and her siblings, and she turned to her paternal grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly to take the place of their beloved mother. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Madonna commented that she saw herself in her youth as a \"lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my"

It was released on 19 June 2000 as the lead single from the duo's self-titled debut studio album. It became a major worldwide success, topping at least 10 music charts, including the national charts of Ireland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. It also topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart in January 2001.\nThe song is written in B flat minor; there is also an acoustic version recorded in G minor. It features a guitar sample of \"Soup for One\" performed by Chic, as written by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. In 2011, Chic added the song to their concert setlist, which is performed as a mash-up song with \"Soup for One\".\nThe single includes the original version of the track, plus an acoustic version, both performed by Modjo. Remixes have been provided by Harry Romero, Roy Davis, Jr. and Danny Tenaglia.\nThe song debuted at number one in the United Kingdom on 10 September 2000, where it stayed for two weeks to become the sixteenth best-selling single of 2000. It also reached number one in seven other European countries and became a top-ten hit in several others, as well as in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. In the United States, the song peaked at number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. As of 2017, the single has sold two million copies worldwide.\nDaily Record wrote that it is a \"brilliant\" house track. Australian music channel Max placed the song at number 790 in their list of the \"1000 Greatest Songs of All Time\" in 2012. Mixmag included \"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" in their list of \"The 30 Best Vocal House Anthems Ever\" in 2018. Insider put the song on their list of the \"102 Songs Everyone Should Listen to in Their Lifetime\" in 2019.\nThe music video for the song was directed by Fran\u00e7ois Nemeta and was filmed in June 2000 in various locations in Quebec, Canada.\nThe video details the various shenanigans of three teenagers, one girl and two boys. The video starts off with a boy with a shaved head who walks into a restaurant to meet the other two. The three then pool all their money together. They make it to a used car dealership, where they buy a car and drive it to a country fair. The three watch a band playing in a bar and then grab their instruments during a break. Their efforts aren't appreciated, and the teenager with the shaved head is hit with a bottle thrown from the crowd, after which they are chased out. They then sneak into a motel, where they proceed to sing and dance while in the shower, all while still clothed. The boy with the shaved head imagines that he is alone with the girl in an exotic location. The next morning, they are chased out by the hotel manager, and they make their escape until their car breaks down. The girl leads the boys into the woods, and they come across a cliff with a view of the city, which they gaze at in awe. The video ends after this scene.\nEuropean CD single\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:46\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" \u2013 5:05\nEuropean 12-inch vinyl\nA1. \"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" \u2013 5:05\nA2. \"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:46\nB1. \"Lady\" (Roy's Universal Soldiers Mix) \u2013 5:10\nB2. \"Lady\" (acoustic) \u2013 3:13\nUK CD single\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:46\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (original mix) \u2013 5:05\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (Acoustique Mix) \u2013 3:13\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (Roy's Universal Soldiers Mix) \u2013 5:10\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (CD-Rom video)\nUK cassette single\nA1. \"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:46\nA2. \"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (original mix) \u2013 5:05\nB1. \"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (remix) \u2013 7:07\nAustralasian CD single\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:46\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" \u2013 5:05\n\"Roller Coaster\" \u2013 6:08\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (remix) \u2013 7:07\nUS CD single\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (original mix)\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (Harry \"Choo Choo\" Romero's Titanium Dub)\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (Roy's Universal Soldiers Mix)\n\"Lady\" (acoustic)\n\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (video)\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Romanian Top 100 number ones of the 2000s\nSmith, Gary (24 June 2000). \"Dance Grooves\" (PDF).

It was released as the fourth single from the album on October 24, 1989 by Sire Records. The song was not released as a single in most European territories until December 24, 1995, when it appeared on the 1995 ballads compilation Something to Remember. Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, the nexus of \"Oh Father\" was the presence of male authoritative figures in Madonna's life, most prominently her father, Tony Ciccone. Madonna's relationship with her father had soured after her mother's death in 1963 and his remarriage two years later. While developing the Like a Prayer album, Madonna was in an emotional state of mind due to her personal problems, which is reflected in \"Oh Father\".\nMusically, \"Oh Father\" is a baroque pop ballad. It was recorded at a studio in the Garment District of New York City. Leonard put together different types of chord progression and created the basic outline of a melody, which Madonna shaped and then wrote lyrics to fit the melody. She used a contrast of timbre while singing the song, which also featured instrumentation from strings, piano, violin and drums. \"Oh Father\" received positive reviews from critics and authors, but commercially was less successful than Madonna's previous singles. In most of the countries where it was released, the song failed to attain top-ten positions, except in Finland, where it peaked at number six. It ended Madonna's string of 16 consecutive top five singles in the United States.\nThe music video of the song was Madonna's attempt to embrace and accept her mother's death. Directed by David Fincher and shot in black-and-white, it shows a little girl playing in the snow, as her mother dies. A grown-up Madonna follows the child and sings the song, as the child runs away from her abusive father. Described by reviewers as \"autobiographical\", the video was listed by Rolling Stone as one of \"The 100 Top Music Videos\". Scholars noted how Madonna's persona was split into the child and adult in the video, and one writer described a scene involving the dead mother shown in her wake, with her lips sewn shut, as one of the most disturbing scenes in the history of mainstream music videos\u2014the scene was inspired by Madonna's memory of her mother from her funeral. \"Oh Father\" was performed only on the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, where Madonna portrayed a woman trying to find her religion and her battle for it.\nWhen Madonna was five years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone (whom Madonna was named after), died of breast cancer at the age of\u00a030. Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's behavior and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. \"I remember feeling stronger than she was\", Madonna recalled, \"I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child.\" Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. \"There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.\u00a0... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also.\"\nMadonna eventually learned to take care of herself and her siblings, and she turned to her paternal grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly to take the place of their beloved mother. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Madonna commented that she saw herself in her youth as a \"lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my"

The song was co-written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato and Tim James, and produced by John Fields. It was released on June 17, 2008, by Hollywood Records as the lead single from the first studio album released by Cyrus with no ties to her character Hannah Montana from the Disney Channel comedy series of the same name. Also registered as \"Seven Things I Hate About You\", Cyrus developed the song during the Best of Both Worlds Tour while feeling numerous emotions for an ex-boyfriend, mainly anger. The song's release brought allegations that it was about Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers, which Cyrus neither confirmed nor denied. Musically, \"7 Things\" bears aspects of both country and pop punk, while the lyrics in the song's refrain list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex-boyfriend.\n\"7 Things\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics and enjoyed worldwide commercial success, becoming a top ten hit on charts in Australia, Japan, Norway, and the United States. The single was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), while its appearance on the Japan Hot 100 made \"7 Things\" Cyrus' first song to chart in an Asian country. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Brett Ratner and features Cyrus performing the song with a back-up band as many teenage girls lipsync along. The girls clutch a variety of props, such as love letters and snow globes, inspired by personal items Cyrus' ex had given her. The video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award at both the 2008 and 2009 award shows. Cyrus promoted the song through several venues including her world tours, the Wonder World Tour and the Gypsy Heart Tour. The song premiered before its official release as a single on May 13, 2008, at the Elvis Duran Show.\n\"7 Things\" is also under the legal title of \"Seven Things I Hate About You\", as registered by Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI). Like most of the songs on Breakout, Cyrus conceived \"7 Things\" while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour from October 2007 to January 2008.\n\"I was locked up in the bus the entire time. And it was, like, such a great time for me to have a minute for myself, which I never get. So it was awesome to get to do that and just kinda go through all the different stages of what's been going on the last couple of years. And I just thought it'd be fun to just kinda. I didn't even mean for it to be for, you know, the record or for anything. It was just like 'just start writing this'. I got into it and I played some of it for my sister and she was like, 'dude, that's awesome'. And it was just so much fun to have, like, a good, little therapy moment for me, just to be able to go through everything. It was awesome. It was so much fun to write.\"\nCyrus says \"7 Things\" was inspired by an ex-boyfriend. In an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Cyrus said that she was \"going through [...] nine-hundred different emotions while trying to write the song\" and that her use of the word \"hate\" demonstrated how furious she was. When Seacrest asked if she was worried the song's subject would hear it and be upset, Cyrus responded that while she was slightly worried, \"I want him to be upset. That was my point.\" She showed her draft to co-songwriters and producers Tim James and Antonia Armato, who suggested adding it to Breakout. Originally, \"7 Things\" was more \"soft and nice\" but Cyrus says she \"went nuts\" during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound. Cyrus had initially chosen \"Fly on the Wall\" as the lead single from Breakout, but replaced it with \"7 Things\" because she felt it was a \"better introduction\" to the album.\nAllegations that \"7 Things\" was about Nick Jonas, lead singer of the Jonas Brothers, arose soon after the song's premiere on the May 13, 2008, broadcast of the Elvis Duran and the Morning Show. Cyrus and Jonas had dated for a year and a half before breaking up in late 2007. Cyrus claimed, \"Nick and I loved each other\" and that after the breakup she \"bawled for a month straight\" while trying to rebel \"against everything Nick wanted [her] to be\".\nHenry Freeland of Paste described \"7 Things\" as \"the list of reasons she hates an ex-boyfriend (who just might be lead Jonas Brother, Nick)\" and her \"concern [...] that all of this hatred only leads them to love Maybe-Nick [...] all the more\".

On September 17, 2002, RCA released it as a double-A side with \"A Moment Like This\" as her coronation single after winning the first season of American Idol.  A remixed version of the song was later included on her debut studio album, Thankful (2003). It went on to become the best-selling single of 2002 in the United States.\n\"Before Your Love\" was written and produced by Desmond Child and Cathy Dennis for the winner of the inaugural season of American Idol. Kelly Clarkson, Justin Guarini, Nikki McKibbin, and Tamyra Gray each recorded a version of the song in case one of them won the season. It was first performed live by Clarkson and Guarini during the final showdown of American Idol at the Kodak Theatre on September 3, 2002. It was then performed by Clarkson during the grand finale on September 4, 2002 before winning the title. It was released as a double-A single with \"A Moment Like This\" on September 17, 2002. It was also one of the few songs to be released as a DVD single in the early 2000s. Clarkson included the song in the setlist for the American Idol Tour in 2002. A music video of the song premiered on MTV as her first music video in September 2002.\n\nThe song has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a \"D+\" rating, he remarked \"The lyrics are generalized banalities (I never lived before your love/I never felt before your touch), the melodies destined to endure as wedding songs or florist ads. A choir at the end of \"A Moment Like This\" is meant to indicate earthiness; the gentle acoustic guitar throughout \"Before Your Love,\" sensitivity.\" Rito Asilo of the Philippine Daily Inquirer remarked that the song's lyrics were \"corny,\" but praised Clarkson's voice. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote: \"Yes, the girl's got immeasurable talent, but the last note of Thankful's final track, a new mix of \"Before Your Love,\" speaks volumes: this is the sound of strained excess.\"\nThe song became a commercial success throughout North America, establishing Clarkson as a hit singer. Along with \"A Moment Like This\", \"Before Your Love\" entered the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 52. The following week it ascended to number one, fueled by sales of over 236,000 copies, making it the first single to sell more than 200,000 copies since 1999. Its ascent broke the record set by the British band The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one after their single \"Can't Buy Me Love\" rose from number 27 to number one in April 1964. That record was later broken by the American pop rock band Maroon 5 when \"Makes Me Wonder\" rose from number 64 to number one in May 2007. Clarkson would later break it again when her single \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" rose from number 97 to number one in February 2009. Despite being commercially successful, it received minimal radio airplay in favor of \"A Moment Like This\". It was later certified gold by the RIAA and double platinum by Music Canada.\nThe music video to the song begins with Clarkson returning to her home after her win on American Idol. She sits in her bedroom before getting ready for a date with her boyfriend. Driving her home from her date, her boyfriend surprises her with a house party in her backyard with friends and family celebrating her American Idol win. Scenes of Clarkson singing in her bedroom and while sitting on her pool ladder intercut throughout.\nCD single\n\"Before Your Love\" \u2013 4:00\n\"A Moment Like This\" \u2013 3:50\n7\" single\n\"Before Your Love\" \u2013 3:59\n\"A Moment Like This\" \u2013 3:47\n \nDVD single\n\"Before Your Love\" (video) \u2013 3:52\n\"A Moment Like This\" (video) \u2013 3:47\nPersonnel\nKelly Clarkson\u00a0\u2013 lead vocals and background vocals\nGary Burr\u00a0\u2013 songwriter\nDesmond Child\u00a0\u2013 songwriter, producer\n \nCathy Dennis\u00a0\u2013 songwriter, producer\nCarlos Alvarez\u00a0\u2013 mixing\nStephen Ferrera\u00a0\u2013 A&R\n\n\n\nList of best-selling singles in the United States (by year)\n\"Clarkson's album tops the charts in just one week\".

The song features songwriting credits from Max Martin, Lukasz Gottwald, and Claude Kelly and production credits from Martin and Gottwald under his production moniker, Dr. Luke. Clarkson co-wrote the track but refused to include her name in the credits as she didn't want to be associated with Luke. \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" was released as the lead single from the album and premiered on January 13, 2009, in the United States on the Z100 radio station and was made available to download three days later. The song has met with positive reviews from music critics, who praised the song's pop composition, which incorporates rock and dance elements.\n\"My Life Would Suck Without You\" peaked at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 when it moved up the chart 96 places from number 97 in its second week on the chart. The song's chart climbing gave Clarkson the record for a single with the furthest jump to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 after achieving the feat with her 2002 single \"A Moment Like This\". Outside of the United States, \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" topped the charts in Canada, Hungary, and the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, where the Idols franchise that spawned American Idol originated, Clarkson became the only alumnus of an international version of Pop Idol to top the UK Singles Chart until Canadian Idol alumnus Carly Rae Jepsen achieved the feat with \"Call Me Maybe\" in April 2012.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Wayne Isham and presents Clarkson's relationship with her fictional boyfriend as being fluctuating and tumultuous as the two are depicted arguing and throwing out each other's belongings whilst mirroring the sentiments of the song and the positive influence each has on the other. The video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the Best Female Video category in 2009.\n\"My Life Would Suck Without You\" was written by Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, Max Martin and Claude Kelly, with additional uncredited songwriting by Kelly Clarkson. Record executive Clive Davis hired Gottwald and Martin to produce a new song for Clarkson in 2008 after her 2007 album My December, for which she refused to work with them, under-performed commercially. Clarkson explained that she objected the collaboration through the entire process due to previous bad experiences working with Gottwald, who co-produced \"Since U Been Gone\" and \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" for Clarkson in 2004. Clarkson eventually gave in claiming the label wouldn't put out her record otherwise. Yet, she was unsatisfied with the original version of the song, which she says differed greatly from the final version and included lyrical references to marijuana, so the writers assisted her in making the song more personal to her and \"better than it was,\" according to Clarkson. After the song was finalized and significant changes to the lyrics had been made, Clarkson said RCA approached her about taking a proper writing credit for the track, which she refused in order to make a point to the label as they failed to meet her one request which was not to have her work with Luke again.\nClaude Kelly worked on additional vocal production for the song. Dr. Luke provided the drums, bass and programming as well as working with Martin on guitars and synthesizers. The song was engineered at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California and Dr. Luke's Studio by Emily Wright and Sam Holland. Wright also edited the vocals with Aniela Gottwald and Kool Kojak.\nOriginally scheduled to hit airwaves on January 19, the song debuted on New York City Top 40 station Z100 on January 13, and the single was then transmitted digitally to radio stations at 6:00 pm EST for immediate airplay. It went officially for adds on radio station playlists on January 20, 2009. It was given a digital release on January 16, 2009, at Amazon.com's MP3 store, with a subsequent release on the US and Canadian iTunes Stores soon after. The song was also released as a download on January 16 in Australia on iTunes. On January 23, the song was announced as the most added song to radio in Australia.\n\"My Life Would Suck Without You\""

She co-wrote the track with its producer Greg Kurstin. A midtempo pop song about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships, Clarkson promulgated \"Piece by Piece\" as a sequel to the song \"Because of You\" (2004) but with a \"happy ending\". After a discussion with her sister about their family life, she introspectively co-wrote the song in a first-person narrative to her father, whose neglect of his family was used as a juxtaposition to her husband's unconditional love for her and their daughter, whom they both promised to never abandon.\n\"Piece by Piece\" was first released as the second promotional single from Piece by Piece by RCA Records on February 24, 2015. Upon its release, the title track received praise from music critics, who commended its lyrical content as one of the album's highlights. Clarkson premiered the song in a live acoustic performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and has showcased it on the set list of the Piece by Piece Tour. A re-worked version of the track was released to American hot adult contemporary radio stations on November 9, 2015, as the third and final single from the album. On February 25, 2016, Clarkson performed \"Piece by Piece\" in a live presentation on the fifteenth season of American Idol. The successful commercial and critical response of her performance on the program led RCA to issue an \"Idol version\" of the track on February 29, 2016.\nThe combined versions of \"Piece by Piece\" allowed the song to debut on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number eight, becoming Clarkson's eleventh top ten hit and tying itself with \"Never Again\" (2007) as her highest debut on the chart. The track also attained the top position on three Billboard charts\u2014primarily the Billboard Digital Songs chart, earning Clarkson her 100th Billboard number-one hit\u2014a milestone in her musical career. \"Piece by Piece\" became a top 40 hit in the music charts of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Scotland. Clarkson later performed a reprise of the Idol version on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on March 3, 2016. The Idol version was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\nOne of the five songs she had written for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote \"Piece by Piece\" with frequent collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: \nA lot of the reasons why I wrote \"Piece by Piece\" was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I think a lot of people go through that.\nLyrically, the song is a midtempo pop number about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships. The song starts with a woman's recollection of her father abandoning his family; by the chorus, she finds a new man in her life, whom she describes as someone who, \"piece by piece\", had restored her \"faith that a man can be kind and a father could stay\". Written in a first-person narrative, Clarkson introspectively co-wrote the song to her father, whose abandonment of his family when she was six years old was utilized as a juxtaposition in contrast to her husband's unconditional love to her and their daughter, whom they had both promised in the song to never leave behind.\nClarkson pegged \"Piece by Piece\" as a follow-up song to her 2004 track \"Because of You\" and the album's \"most personal\" record, saying that \"once you've worked through that and you find love and the kind of happiness you hoped for but didn't really know was possible. It's a happy song. And it has a happy ending, unlike 'Because of You'\". She revealed that she was inspired to write it after a discussion with her sister about their relationships with their respective"

On September 17, 2002, RCA released it as a double-A side with \"A Moment Like This\" as her coronation single after winning the first season of American Idol.  A remixed version of the song was later included on her debut studio album, Thankful (2003). It went on to become the best-selling single of 2002 in the United States.\n\"Before Your Love\" was written and produced by Desmond Child and Cathy Dennis for the winner of the inaugural season of American Idol. Kelly Clarkson, Justin Guarini, Nikki McKibbin, and Tamyra Gray each recorded a version of the song in case one of them won the season. It was first performed live by Clarkson and Guarini during the final showdown of American Idol at the Kodak Theatre on September 3, 2002. It was then performed by Clarkson during the grand finale on September 4, 2002 before winning the title. It was released as a double-A single with \"A Moment Like This\" on September 17, 2002. It was also one of the few songs to be released as a DVD single in the early 2000s. Clarkson included the song in the setlist for the American Idol Tour in 2002. A music video of the song premiered on MTV as her first music video in September 2002.\n\nThe song has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a \"D+\" rating, he remarked \"The lyrics are generalized banalities (I never lived before your love/I never felt before your touch), the melodies destined to endure as wedding songs or florist ads. A choir at the end of \"A Moment Like This\" is meant to indicate earthiness; the gentle acoustic guitar throughout \"Before Your Love,\" sensitivity.\" Rito Asilo of the Philippine Daily Inquirer remarked that the song's lyrics were \"corny,\" but praised Clarkson's voice. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote: \"Yes, the girl's got immeasurable talent, but the last note of Thankful's final track, a new mix of \"Before Your Love,\" speaks volumes: this is the sound of strained excess.\"\nThe song became a commercial success throughout North America, establishing Clarkson as a hit singer. Along with \"A Moment Like This\", \"Before Your Love\" entered the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 52. The following week it ascended to number one, fueled by sales of over 236,000 copies, making it the first single to sell more than 200,000 copies since 1999. Its ascent broke the record set by the British band The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one after their single \"Can't Buy Me Love\" rose from number 27 to number one in April 1964. That record was later broken by the American pop rock band Maroon 5 when \"Makes Me Wonder\" rose from number 64 to number one in May 2007. Clarkson would later break it again when her single \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" rose from number 97 to number one in February 2009. Despite being commercially successful, it received minimal radio airplay in favor of \"A Moment Like This\". It was later certified gold by the RIAA and double platinum by Music Canada.\nThe music video to the song begins with Clarkson returning to her home after her win on American Idol. She sits in her bedroom before getting ready for a date with her boyfriend. Driving her home from her date, her boyfriend surprises her with a house party in her backyard with friends and family celebrating her American Idol win.

One of the three songs recorded for the compilation, it was released as its third and final single through RCA Records on April 8, 2013. Written by Meghan Kabir, James Michael, Blair Daly, and produced by Greg Kurstin, \"People Like Us\" is an uptempo pop song, with its lyrical content primarily dealing with themes of empowerment, acceptance, and assurance for the eccentrics, who were being dedicated to as \"people like us\".\nUpon Chapter One's release, \"People Like Us\" received positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented its lyrical content and Clarkson's vocal performance. In the United States, it peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 65 and has topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It also charted on the Adult Pop Songs and Pop Songs charts. Internationally, \"People Like Us\" attained a top forty position in the national charts of Canada, New Zealand, Slovakia, South Korea, and Ukraine.\nFilmed by Chris Marrs Piliero, the accompanying music video for \"People Like Us\" is presented in a predominantly monochromatic atmosphere and featured Clarkson portraying an undercover scientist who furtively escapes an experimental subject with a full colored appearance into freedom. The video has met with positive reception from critics, who complimented its visual treatment and compared it to the 1998 film Pleasantville. Clarkson has performed the song in limited live performances, premiering it  on the twelfth season of American Idol.\nLess than a year after the release of her fifth studio album, Stronger (2011), Clarkson began to record tracks with Greg Kurstin for a potential sixth studio album during the Labor Day weekend in 2012. She explained, \"We're always working, I go overseas for awhile [sic] and when I come back it's the holidays. I wanna make sure I have actual time off, so I like to get ahead of the game.\" Kurstin had previously collaborated with Clarkson for Stronger, producing the songs \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\", \"Dark Side\" and \"Honestly\". She remarked, \"He has this whole jazz background, brings kind of a cool element to pop music. The cool thing about it is he gets in the studio and he doesn't have a formula. It's like everything could change.\"\nOne of the three songs recorded for Greatest Hits \u2013 Chapter One, along with \"Catch My Breath\" and \"Don't Rush\", \"People Like Us\" was written by Meghan Kabir, James Michael and Blair Daly, with production handled by Greg Kurstin. It marked the first time Michael, lead singer of the rock band Sixx:A.M., had co-written a single for a pop artist, having previously written songs for rock musicians such as Sixx:A.M., Meat Loaf, and Papa Roach. On November 14, 2012, five days ahead of Chapter One's release, the song premiered online on Clarkson's YouTube channel.\n\"People Like Us\" is a pop anthem with a length of four minutes and 20 seconds, a radio edit of it omits a part of the final chorus. The track begins with a spoken word intro and opens into an up-tempo pop melody, with its lyrics mainly exploring the themes of assurance, empowerment, celebration for the eccentrics and outcasts, which were dedicated by Clarkson as \"people like us\".\nThe song is performed in the key of E\u266d minor with a tempo of 128 beats per minute in common time.  It follows a chord progression of E\u266dm\u2013G\u266d\u2013B\u266dm\u2013A\u266d, and Clarkson's vocals span from D\u266d\u2084 to E\u266d\u2085.\n\nThe single received generally favorable reviews from critics. Carl Williott of Idolator wrote in a review, \"'People Like Us' showcases Kelly\u2019s ability to turn frustration into uplifting (and danceable) catharsis. With lines like 'We are all misfits livin' in a world on fire,' it\u2019s another colossal, fist-in-the-air pop anthem from Clarkson.\" Andy Scott of Celebuzz also wrote a positive review, remarking: \"the latest single from the Grammy-winning superstar is exactly what we've come to expect from her: infectious beats; uplifting lyrics; and a powerful chorus that reminds one of her past hits like \"Since U Been Gone\" and \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\".

It is co-written by Clarkson and Ryan Tedder, who also produced it. The song was released as the album's third single in August 2009. Lyrically, \"Already Gone\" is about the breakup of a relationship; the music consists of an arrangement using a piano, drums, and string instruments.\nThe production and release of \"Already Gone\" have been surrounded in controversy. Clarkson claimed that Tedder re-used the musical arrangement on the 2009 Beyonc\u00e9 song \"Halo\", and stated that the public would incorrectly assume that she had stolen it; Tedder declared the accusations hurtful and false. After failing to prevent the song from being included on All I Ever Wanted because the track listing had already been finalized and the album was already being pressed, Clarkson then voiced her anger towards her record company bosses for subsequently deciding to release it as a single. The accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who complained that he was not allowed to fully realize his vision, and stated he was unhappy with the final result. It features scenes of Clarkson dressed in a gold gown and expensive jewelry while lying on a chaise longue in an apartment. Shots of floating objects intersperse a second scene in which Clarkson, wearing a black dress, sings in a rehearsal room while surrounded by the instruments of an invisible orchestra.\nDespite her dissatisfaction with the song's release as a single, Clarkson began promoting it in July 2009, performing it live on the Late Show with David Letterman and other talk shows. In the fall, she performed the song on VH1 Divas and at the American Music Awards. She included \"Already Gone\" in the encore set of her 2009 All I Ever Wanted Tour. Clarkson has also performed the song in tours after. The song has received much praise from music critics, and is regarded as one of the highlights of All I Ever Wanted. Critics have praised the song for its expressions of vulnerability, its emotional impact, and its successful use of the ballad form. It peaked at number\u00a013 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia.\n\"Already Gone\" was co-written by Clarkson and OneRepublic lead singer Ryan Tedder. Tedder describes it as \"an emotional, heartbreaking breakup song.\"  Tedder and Clarkson wrote six songs together for inclusion on Clarkson's fourth studio album All I Ever Wanted, and \"Already Gone\" is one of three of those that appear on the track list.\n\"Already Gone\" is a pop ballad. The music is described by Sarah Liss of CBC News as having \"a pounding heartbeat, twinkly piano and swooping strings\", and by James Montgomery of MTV as having \"somber piano, crashing drums and hand-claps\". Eric R. Danton from The Hartford Courant explains that the piano and string arrangements \"roll mournfully\" over the percussion. The sheet music indicates that the song is set in common time and has a moderately slow tempo with a metronome of 74 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major arranged in the chord progression of A\u2013Esus4\u2013E\u2013F\u266fm\u2013D\u2013A\u2013Esus4-E\u2013F\u266fm\u2013D\u2013Bm\u2013D in the verses, and A\u2013Esus4\u2013E\u2013F\u266fm\u2013E\u2013D\u2013E in the chorus. The vocal range spans from B\u2083 to E\u2085.\nThe song's narrative is in first person, and depicts Clarkson telling her lover that although he has done nothing wrong in their relationship, it was never meant to be and is destined for failure. She tells her partner that he \"couldn't have loved [her] better\", but to avoid hurting him in the future, he should move on, as she \"is already gone\". Clarkson sings with what Danton describes as \"layered vocals\".\nBefore teaming with Clarkson to write \"Already Gone\", Ryan Tedder had co-written Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Halo\" for her album I Am... Sasha Fierce. Clarkson later heard \"Halo\" and noticed distinct similarities between the two songs, most notably in the melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps in their backing tracks. She confronted Tedder about using the same arrangement, claiming that people would assume she had stolen it from Knowles. Clarkson tried to have the song removed from All I Ever Wanted, but it was too late to make any changes; the album was already being pressed"

On September 17, 2002, RCA released it as a double-A side with \"A Moment Like This\" as her coronation single after winning the first season of American Idol.  A remixed version of the song was later included on her debut studio album, Thankful (2003). It went on to become the best-selling single of 2002 in the United States.\n\"Before Your Love\" was written and produced by Desmond Child and Cathy Dennis for the winner of the inaugural season of American Idol. Kelly Clarkson, Justin Guarini, Nikki McKibbin, and Tamyra Gray each recorded a version of the song in case one of them won the season. It was first performed live by Clarkson and Guarini during the final showdown of American Idol at the Kodak Theatre on September 3, 2002. It was then performed by Clarkson during the grand finale on September 4, 2002 before winning the title. It was released as a double-A single with \"A Moment Like This\" on September 17, 2002. It was also one of the few songs to be released as a DVD single in the early 2000s. Clarkson included the song in the setlist for the American Idol Tour in 2002. A music video of the song premiered on MTV as her first music video in September 2002.\n\nThe song has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a \"D+\" rating, he remarked \"The lyrics are generalized banalities (I never lived before your love/I never felt before your touch), the melodies destined to endure as wedding songs or florist ads. A choir at the end of \"A Moment Like This\" is meant to indicate earthiness; the gentle acoustic guitar throughout \"Before Your Love,\" sensitivity.\" Rito Asilo of the Philippine Daily Inquirer remarked that the song's lyrics were \"corny,\" but praised Clarkson's voice. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote: \"Yes, the girl's got immeasurable talent, but the last note of Thankful's final track, a new mix of \"Before Your Love,\" speaks volumes: this is the sound of strained excess.\"\nThe song became a commercial success throughout North America, establishing Clarkson as a hit singer. Along with \"A Moment Like This\", \"Before Your Love\" entered the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 52. The following week it ascended to number one, fueled by sales of over 236,000 copies, making it the first single to sell more than 200,000 copies since 1999. Its ascent broke the record set by the British band The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one after their single \"Can't Buy Me Love\" rose from number 27 to number one in April 1964. That record was later broken by the American pop rock band Maroon 5 when \"Makes Me Wonder\" rose from number 64 to number one in May 2007. Clarkson would later break it again when her single \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" rose from number 97 to number one in February 2009. Despite being commercially successful, it received minimal radio airplay in favor of \"A Moment Like This\". It was later certified gold by the RIAA and double platinum by Music Canada.\nThe music video to the song begins with Clarkson returning to her home after her win on American Idol. She sits in her bedroom before getting ready for a date with her boyfriend. Driving her home from her date, her boyfriend surprises her with a house party in her backyard with friends and family celebrating her American Idol win.

It is the third single from Underwood's second studio album, Carnival Ride. It was released in the United States on April 7, 2008, by which point the song had already charted. At the 51st Grammy Awards, the song won Underwood her third consecutive Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. It has sold 1,300,000 copies to date.\nThe song is one of four tracks on the album co-written by Underwood, and the third consecutive one to be released as a single from the album.\nThe song is a moderate up-tempo describing a woman meeting a man at a club and later eloping with him in Las Vegas after having had too much to drink that night. She wakes up the next morning, \"thinkin' 'bout Elvis somewhere in Vegas\", to discover that she does not even know her last name (i.e., she married the man while she was intoxicated), and worries that her \"mama would be so ashamed.\" The music video portrays the song as a prequel to her \"Before He Cheats\" song, even going so far as to hire the same actor to play the man in question.\nThe single was generally met with mixed reviews.\nAllmusic picked the song as a \"track pick\", calling the song \"Miranda Lambert filtered through Shania Twain\", and dubbed it a \"one night stand anthem.\" Rolling Stone picked the track as their favorite, saying \"the most fun is \"Last Name,\" where she gets wasted and runs off to Vegas with a guy she doesn't know.\" Blender awarded the song four out of five stars, describing the song as the \"most irresponsible (and fun) moment on the new album involves one wild night, one too many shots of Cuervo and one unexpected ring.\" Billboard gave a positive review of the track, praising the lyrics: \"It's a cleverly penned lyric that hilariously celebrates drunken debauchery\" as well as summing it up as \"a performance that combines soulful vocals, edgy intensity and sassy attitude into a delicious cocktail.\"\nHowever, it also received some negative reviews: Engine 145 gave the song a 'thumbs down', describing the song as a \"straight-laced performance\" that just \"places the focus on the vocal\". Slant Magazine labelled the single as a \"bald-faced attempt at recreating the 'Before He Cheats' phenomenon\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwood performed the song live for the first time on television during the 43rd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards on May 18, 2008. She performed the song live at the seventh season finale of American Idol on May 21, 2008. She performed the song at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009.\nThe song is described in the video as what happened before the \"Before He Cheats\" video.\nThe video starts with some segments from \"Before He Cheats\" and then goes into a scene three months earlier (\"before he cheated\", it says) with her in the club drinking with her friends. The same man from the \"Before He Cheats\" spots her and asks her for a dance. From this point on, while the guy is with Underwood, he is flirting with every other woman he sees. After the dance, Underwood leaves with the guy in his car with fuzzy dice in the rear view mirror. They make it out to Las Vegas where they participate in a couple of gambling activities such as roulette and a Wheel of Fortune game where they win a new truck. Later they get married in a chapel with an Elvis impersonator officiating. They run off in his new pickup truck (the one used in \"Before He Cheats\") and the video ends with a spark from the chapel sign lights.\nThe song debuted at number 46 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, nearly a month before the single's official release. For the week of June 21, 2008 it rose from number five to number one, to become her fifth straight number one on the Billboard chart, her seventh straight number one country single, and her eighth number one Billboard single overall. This marked Underwood as the first solo female artist to have five consecutive number one's on the country survey in almost 20 years, since Rosanne Cash had a string of six number one titles between 1987 and 1989. It is the third country number one from Carnival Ride and reached the top of the chart faster than the first two singles, taking only 13 weeks. \"Last Name\" has sold 1,300,000 downloads as of November 2015.\nOn the Hot 100 the song reached number 19, making it Underwood's fifth top 20 Hot 100 hit, and the second from Carnival Ride.\n\n\n\nKristin Chenoweth performed a cover of the song"

It was released in April 2011 as the first single from Shelton's 2011 album Red River Blue. The song reached number one on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in July 2011. On November 30, the song received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Solo Performance, but it lost to Taylor Swift's \"Mean\".\nBlake Shelton debuted \"Honey Bee\" at the Academy of Country Music awards telecast on April 3, 2011, where he also sang \"Who Are You When I'm Not Looking\". \"Honey Bee\" was released to digital retailers immediately after the broadcast.\nRhett Akins and Ben Hayslip, two-thirds of the \"Peach Pickers\" writing ensemble, wrote the song. Akins said that he first thought of writing a song called \"Huckleberry\" after seeing an article in Billboard magazine about former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. He then changed the word to \"honeysuckle\", and came up with the line \"You be my honeysuckle, and I'll be your honey bee.\" Akins said that he thought that \"it was a different way for the guy to say, 'we should date, I love you.'\"\nThe lines \"You'll be my Louisiana, I'll be your Mississippi / You'll be my Little Loretta, I'll be your Conway Twitty\" refers to the Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn duet \"Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man\" on the album of the same name.\nThe music video premiered on NBC.com on May 10, 2011. It was filmed in California, and directed by Trey Fanjoy.\nThe video features Shelton stopping at a roadside stand, where a young woman (portrayed by Amra Silajd\u017ei\u0107) is selling honey and other related products.  Shelton purchases a jar of \"Tupelo Honey\" from the seller.  Shelton frequently returns to the stand, buying more and more products (which, as the video changes scenes from the stand to Shelton's living room, the room becomes more and more filled with products from the stand), until one day he passes the stand and sees an \"out of business\" sign.  The seller approaches with another sign (\"Sorry, out of honey\") and Shelton finally gets her to come with him.\n\nMatt Bjorke of Roughstock rated the single four stars out of five. His review praised the \"charisma\" in Shelton's voice and thought that the song had a \"timeless\" feel to it. Slant Magazine reviewer Jonathan Keefe criticized the lyrics, but praised Shelton's vocals. C. M. Wilcox of The 9513 gave the song a thumbs down, saying that the lyrics were written in a \"repetitive, fill-in-the-blank structure,\" and criticized Shelton for recording \"ear catching but substantively bankrupt country boy hokum.\"\nThe song sold 138,000 digital downloads in its first week, setting a record for the most first-week downloads by a male country singer. As a result of the downloads, the song debuted at number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated for the week ending April 23, 2011. This entry makes him the highest-debuting male country artist on the Hot 100 since Garth Brooks (recording as Chris Gaines) debuted at number five in September 1999 with \"Lost in You\". \"Honey Bee\" also debuted at number 31 on the Hot Country Songs charts and number 58 on the Canadian Hot 100. By its seventh week, the song had gone digital gold, making it the fastest rising single ever to sell over 500,000 digital copies by a male country soloist. It became Shelton's fourth consecutive and ninth Number One single on the country chart dated June 25, 2011.  It has sold 2,372,000 copies in the US as of September 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nStromblad, Cory (April 4, 2011). \"Blake Shelton Debuts New Song, 'Honey Bee'\". The Boot.

It was the lead single from his tenth studio album, Drive (2002), released on Arista Nashville. The song's lyrics center on reactions to the September 11 attacks in the United States, written in the form of questions. Jackson desired to write a song capturing the emotions surrounding the attacks, but found it difficult to do so.\nHe debuted the song publicly at the Country Music Association's annual awards show on November 7, 2001. It was released that month as a single and topped the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart for five weeks; in addition, it reached number 28 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100 chart. The song received largely positive reviews from critics, who appreciated its simple, largely apolitical stance. The song won multiple awards at the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association Awards, including Song of the Year, and also earned Jackson his first Grammy Award for Best Country Song.\nThe song is based on Jackson\u2019s own experience on September 11, 2001. Jackson had finished walking outside and returned indoors to discover news of the attacks on television. He immediately wanted to write a song expressing his thoughts and emotions, but he found it hard to do so for many weeks. \"I didn't want to write a patriotic song,\" Jackson said. \"And I didn't want it to be vengeful, either. But I didn't want to forget about how I felt and how I knew other people felt that day.\"\nFinally, on the Sunday morning of October 28, 2001, he awoken at 4 a.m. with the melody, opening lines, and chorus going through his mind. He hastily got out of bed, still in his underwear, and sang them into a hand-held digital recorder so as to remember them later on. Later that morning, when his wife and children had gone to Sunday school, he sat down in his study and completed the lyrics.\nInitially, he felt squeamish about recording it, much less releasing it as a single, because he disliked the idea of capitalizing on a tragedy. But after he played it for his wife Denise and for his producer, Keith Stegall, both of whom gave their approval, Jackson went into the studio to record \"Where Were You\" that week. On Stegall's advice, Jackson played the finished track for a group of executives at his record label. \"We just kind of looked at one another,\" RCA Label Group chairman Joe Galante said later. \"Nobody spoke for a full minute.\"\nThe verses focus on others' reactions in the form of questions. One verse asks, \"Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow?/Go out and buy you a gun?/Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'/And turn on I Love Lucy reruns?\" In between, he asks about the locations of people when the tragedy played out, \"Were you in the yard with your wife and children?/Or workin' on some stage in LA?\"  In the chorus, Jackson tries to sum up his own feelings, first by calling himself merely \"a singer of simple songs\", and \"not a real political man\", and finally by paraphrasing the Biblical New Testament's first letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 13, verse 13: \"Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us/And the greatest is love.\"\nThe song is in the key of C major with a vocal range of A\u2082-C\u2084 and a primary chord pattern of C-G.\nJackson was scheduled to perform at the Country Music Association's annual awards ceremony on November 7, 2001, to be aired on CBS. Originally, he planned to perform \"Where I Come From\", which, at the time, was the No. 1 hit on the Billboard country charts. But mere days before the awards show, Jackson's manager, Nancy Russell, played a recording of \"Where Were You\" for four of the CMA's top executives. All four were overcome with emotion by the time the song ended.\nThe day before the show, CMT had a brief note on its web site that Jackson would be introducing the new song during the awards telecast. The next night, after an introduction from the show's host, Vince Gill, Jackson performed \"Where Were You\" seated on a stool, with an orchestra and backing singers behind him. At the conclusion of the five-minute-long song, the audience gave him an immediate standing ovation. This performance, along with Gill's introduction, is used as the song's music video.\n\nThe next morning, many stations already were playing Jackson's new song after taping it from the broadcast. Several pop-oriented stations, including one in New York, started to play it as well. Based"

It was released in April 2011 as the first single from Shelton's 2011 album Red River Blue. The song reached number one on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in July 2011. On November 30, the song received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Solo Performance, but it lost to Taylor Swift's \"Mean\".\nBlake Shelton debuted \"Honey Bee\" at the Academy of Country Music awards telecast on April 3, 2011, where he also sang \"Who Are You When I'm Not Looking\". \"Honey Bee\" was released to digital retailers immediately after the broadcast.\nRhett Akins and Ben Hayslip, two-thirds of the \"Peach Pickers\" writing ensemble, wrote the song. Akins said that he first thought of writing a song called \"Huckleberry\" after seeing an article in Billboard magazine about former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. He then changed the word to \"honeysuckle\", and came up with the line \"You be my honeysuckle, and I'll be your honey bee.\" Akins said that he thought that \"it was a different way for the guy to say, 'we should date, I love you.'\"\nThe lines \"You'll be my Louisiana, I'll be your Mississippi / You'll be my Little Loretta, I'll be your Conway Twitty\" refers to the Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn duet \"Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man\" on the album of the same name.\nThe music video premiered on NBC.com on May 10, 2011. It was filmed in California, and directed by Trey Fanjoy.\nThe video features Shelton stopping at a roadside stand, where a young woman (portrayed by Amra Silajd\u017ei\u0107) is selling honey and other related products.  Shelton purchases a jar of \"Tupelo Honey\" from the seller.  Shelton frequently returns to the stand, buying more and more products (which, as the video changes scenes from the stand to Shelton's living room, the room becomes more and more filled with products from the stand), until one day he passes the stand and sees an \"out of business\" sign.  The seller approaches with another sign (\"Sorry, out of honey\") and Shelton finally gets her to come with him.\n\nMatt Bjorke of Roughstock rated the single four stars out of five. His review praised the \"charisma\" in Shelton's voice and thought that the song had a \"timeless\" feel to it. Slant Magazine reviewer Jonathan Keefe criticized the lyrics, but praised Shelton's vocals. C. M. Wilcox of The 9513 gave the song a thumbs down, saying that the lyrics were written in a \"repetitive, fill-in-the-blank structure,\" and criticized Shelton for recording \"ear catching but substantively bankrupt country boy hokum.\"\nThe song sold 138,000 digital downloads in its first week, setting a record for the most first-week downloads by a male country singer. As a result of the downloads, the song debuted at number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated for the week ending April 23, 2011. This entry makes him the highest-debuting male country artist on the Hot 100 since Garth Brooks (recording as Chris Gaines) debuted at number five in September 1999 with \"Lost in You\". \"Honey Bee\" also debuted at number 31 on the Hot Country Songs charts and number 58 on the Canadian Hot 100. By its seventh week, the song had gone digital gold, making it the fastest rising single ever to sell over 500,000 digital copies by a male country soloist. It became Shelton's fourth consecutive and ninth Number One single on the country chart dated June 25, 2011.  It has sold 2,372,000 copies in the US as of September 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nStromblad, Cory (April 4, 2011). \"Blake Shelton Debuts New Song, 'Honey Bee'\". The Boot.

It was released on January 26, 2009, as the third and final single from the group's self-titled debut album. Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, who comprise Lady Antebellum, co-wrote the song with Tom Douglas. \"I Run to You\" is the group's first number-one single, reaching that peak in July 2009, and it features lead vocals from both Scott and Kelley.\nThe song won the 2009 CMA Single of the Year Award on November 11, 2009.

It was released on August 9, 2010, in support of their debut UK live show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. The single made the A-list playlist on BBC Radio 2.\n\"I Run to You\" is a mid-tempo with electric guitar and string section accompaniment. In it, the narrators \u2014 lead singers Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott \u2014 claim that they turn to each other to escape the negativity and prejudice of the world.\nBrady Vercher of Engine 145 gave the song a \"thumbs down\" review, calling it \"a vague profession of love\" and adding, \"The song comes across as purposefully cryptic because they either didn\u2019t fully develop the idea, haven\u2019t become comfortable opening up in their lyrics, or they just didn\u2019t feel the need to focus on the lyric other than as a device to support the melody.\" Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song a B rating, saying that it \"rolls sweetly along and never tries to sound more important than it really is\".\nPaul Worley, who co-produced the album and played guitar on it, said, \"The song is an expression against hate, prejudice, negativity, running the rat race, but ultimately the redemption of love! And it has an irresistible melody and a head-bobbing groove. What could be better?\"\n\"I Run to You\" debuted at number 50 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart dated January 31, 2009. After spending 26 weeks on the chart, the song became the trio's first number one hit for the week of July 25, 2009. The song has also become Lady Antebellum's first top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 27.

The video follows a chain of events, which depicts how one good deed leads to another. It begins with a mother giving money to a man playing guitar on the sidewalk, who walks into a coffee shop and loans money to a businessman who left his wallet at home. The businessman then helps a woman pick up her stack of papers that scatters when she falls over. Later, the woman takes a seat on the bench and waits for the bus. The mother from the beginning arrives at the bus stop and she gives up her seat for her. Included with these are scenes of the trio singing in a small hotel room.\nA second video for the European release of \"I Run to You\" was shot and debuted on their record label Parlophone's YouTube page on July 30, 2010. This alternate video was directed by Christopher Sims.\nKian Egan, formerly of Westlife, covered this song in a duet with his wife, Jodi Albert, on his 2014 debut solo album Home.\nDigital download\n\"I Run to You\" - 4:16\nUS digital download \u2014 single (Acoustic)\n\"I Run to You\" (Live) - 3:49\nEuropean digital download \u2014 single\n\"I Run to You\" - 4:18\n\"I Run to You\" (Live at The Ryman) - 5:01\nThe following musicians perform on this track:\nJohn Catchings \u2013 cello\nChad Cromwell \u2013 drums\nDavid Davidson \u2013 violin\nJason \"Slim\" Gambill \u2013 electric guitar\nJim Grosjean \u2013 viola\nDave Haywood \u2013 electric guitar, acoustic guitar, background vocals\nCharles Kelley \u2013 lead vocals\nRob McNelley \u2013 electric guitar\nSari Reist \u2013"

Slant Magazine reviewer Jonathan Keefe criticized the lyrics, but praised Shelton's vocals. C. M. Wilcox of The 9513 gave the song a thumbs down, saying that the lyrics were written in a \"repetitive, fill-in-the-blank structure,\" and criticized Shelton for recording \"ear catching but substantively bankrupt country boy hokum.\"\nThe song sold 138,000 digital downloads in its first week, setting a record for the most first-week downloads by a male country singer. As a result of the downloads, the song debuted at number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated for the week ending April 23, 2011. This entry makes him the highest-debuting male country artist on the Hot 100 since Garth Brooks (recording as Chris Gaines) debuted at number five in September 1999 with \"Lost in You\". \"Honey Bee\" also debuted at number 31 on the Hot Country Songs charts and number 58 on the Canadian Hot 100. By its seventh week, the song had gone digital gold, making it the fastest rising single ever to sell over 500,000 digital copies by a male country soloist. It became Shelton's fourth consecutive and ninth Number One single on the country chart dated June 25, 2011.  It has sold 2,372,000 copies in the US as of September 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nStromblad, Cory (April 4, 2011). \"Blake Shelton Debuts New Song, 'Honey Bee'\". The Boot.

It was released on August 6, 1990 as the lead single from his album No Fences. The song spent four weeks at number one on the Hot Country Songs, and won both the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association awards for 1990 Single of the Year.\n\"Friends in Low Places\" was written in 1989 by songwriters Earl Bud Lee and Dewayne Blackwell. The two songwriters had given the song to Brooks to record as a demo soon before the release of his self-titled first album, when he was a relatively unknown singer. Enamored with the song, Brooks recorded the official version the next year. Mark Chesnutt recorded the song for his second album Too Cold at Home.\nAccording to Earl Bud Lee, one of the song's co-writers, the idea of the song was born when he and some songwriting friends gathered for lunch one day at Tavern on the Row, a popular Nashville eatery. When the check came, Lee realized he had forgotten his money. He was asked how he was going to pay for the meal, and he replied, \"Don't worry. I have friends in low places. I know the cook.\" Lee and his songwriting partner, Dewayne Blackwell, immediately recognized that the line \"friends in low places\" had potential, but they didn't act upon it immediately.\nSome months later, Lee and Blackwell were at a party, celebrating a recent No. 1 hit by another songwriter. They began to talk about the dormant \"friends in low places\" idea, and \"at that very moment, it all started to come together in a song,\" Lee said. Because nothing else was available, they wrote the song on paper napkins. When the songwriters polished \"Friends in Low Places\", they contacted Garth Brooks to see if he would record a demo for them.\nGuitarist James Garver would add the name of the bar in the song, \"The Oasis\", after an establishment in his hometown of Concordia, Kansas.\n\"Friends in Low Places\" is in a moderate tempo and the key of A major. The song begins with arpeggios on the chords A, B\u266ddim7, B\u20987, and Eadd9, a pattern which is repeated throughout the verses. The intro was not originally part of the song, but was improvised by session guitarist Mark Casstevens. The chorus uses A-B\u2098-E twice before ending on an A chord. An electric guitar solo with pedal steel guitar flourishes is played between the first chorus and second verse.\n\"Friends in Low Places\" requires an unusually wide vocal range spanning over two octaves to be sung properly. The song spans from a low note of E\u2082 to a high of F\u266f\u2084.\nLee and Blackwell had met Brooks when he was a shoe salesman in a Nashville store, looking for his big break. The two struck up a conversation with the struggling musician, and upon learning his background, they gave him some work making demos of their songs. They were impressed with his voice and talent, but there wasn't much else they could do for him.\nWhen Blackwell contacted Brooks to make the \"Friends in Low Places\" demo, Brooks explained to Blackwell that he was newly signed to Capitol Records, and that his first single and first album were already scheduled.\nThe demo of \"Friends in Low Places\" was recorded at Windwalker Studios, in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. Musicians on the demo were John Beland (of The Flying Burrito Brothers) on acoustic and electric guitars, along with session aces Steve Turner on drums, and bassist Larry Paxton. Frank Green was the recording engineer. The actual master recording of \"Friends in Low Places\" borrowed quite a lot from the original demo, copying Beland's now famous acoustic guitar intro.\nAfter recording the demo (the last he would ever make), Brooks thanked Lee and Blackwell for all of their help. He then expressed his liking for the song, wishing aloud that he had heard it several weeks earlier, when he was recording his new album.\nBrooks provided the following background information on the song in the CD booklet liner notes from The Hits:\n\"\"Friends in Low Places\" was the last demo session I ever did as a singer. The demo was for Bud Lee and Dewayne Blackwell. I sang the session out in Hendersonville, and for the next two weeks the chorus to this song kept running through my head. I knew it would be a year and a half before the release of No Fences because Garth Brooks was just getting ready to be released. I asked Bud Lee and Dewayne if I could hold on to it and, without a blink of an eye, they both said yes. Putting that kind of faith into an"

It was released as their sixth single and the first from the band's third studio album, The Number of the Beast (1982). It is their first single with Bruce Dickinson as vocalist. Credited solely to the band's bassist, Steve Harris, Dickinson contributed to the song but could not be credited due to a contractual agreement with his former band Sansom. Run to the Hills remains one of the band's most popular songs, with VH1 ranking it No. 27 on their list of the 40 Greatest Metal Songs and No. 14 on their list of the Greatest Hard Rock Songs.\nA live version of the song, from Live After Death, was released in 1985 and the original single was reissued in 2002, with all income donated to former drummer Clive Burr's MS Trust Fund. In 1990, as part of The First Ten Years box set, both the original and the 1985 live single were reissued on CD and 12\" vinyl, combined with \"The Number of the Beast\" and \"Running Free (live)\" respectively.\nDue to contractual issues with his previous band, Samson, Dickinson could not be credited for any of his contributions made during the writing of The Number of the Beast. Although bassist Steve Harris alone receives credit for the song, Dickinson states that he made a \"moral contribution\" to the song, in addition to \"Children of the Damned\" and \"The Prisoner\" from the same album. While speaking at the IBM Smarter Business conference in Stockholm on 10 October 2012, Dickinson revealed that parts of the song are based on the \"rising sixth\" interval within a scale, inspired by a documentary he watched which explored why \"My Way\" was one of the most popular recorded songs.\nThe song documents the colonization of the Americas, first by Europeans and then by Americans, from the perspective of a Cree Indian and American cavalryman. The opening verse is from the perspective of the Cree, describing his troubles as the European Americans \"came across the sea\", bringing the Cree \"pain and misery\". The song is written from both perspectives, The second verse is from the perspective of a U.S. cavalry soldier, describing his involvement in the American Indian Wars, \"chasing the redskins back to their holes\". The third verse is not from the perspective of any single individual, and harshly condemns the effects of American expansionism on Native Americans, resulting in the \"[Americans] raping the women and wasting the men\", and \"enslaving the young and destroying the old\".\nThe song was released as a single on 12 February 1982; more than 5 weeks prior to the album's release on 22 March 1982. The single marked Iron Maiden's debut release with new vocalist Bruce Dickinson. \"Total Eclipse\" was selected as the single's B-side over the song \"Gangland\", which in turn would appear on the initial version of the album. The band later regretted this decision, with Steve Harris commenting, \"We chose the wrong track as the B-side. I think if \"Total Eclipse\" had been on the album instead of \"Gangland\", it would have been far better.\" The song was added to The Number of the Beast album when it was remastered in 1998, and was also included in the original Japanese version.\nIt is the second of three single covers featuring Derek Riggs' depiction of Satan, which debuted on \"Purgatory\" and later appeared on \"The Number of the Beast\" covers. According to Riggs, the idea behind the original \"Run to the Hills\" cover was based around the idea of a \"power struggle in hell\", in which the band's mascot, Eddie, battles Satan with a tomahawk (referencing the song's subject matter).\nAs of 2017 the single has sold more than 200,000 copies in UK and has been certified Silver by BPI, the first to do so.\nIn 1985, a live version of \"Run to the Hills\", taken from Live After Death, was released as the band's thirteenth single, along with live versions of \"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\" as its B-sides. According to Riggs, he was asked to paint a cover illustration for both \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Phantom of"

It was released in Italy in June 2002 as the lead single from his album Hypnotica. Using MacinTalk, the song's vocals consist of two speech synthesizers, one male and one female, repeatedly saying \"Push me and then just touch me till I can get my satisfaction\". The track was Benassi's debut single and most successful song, peaking at number two in the United Kingdom and earning a Gold certification in Australia, Belgium, France, and the United States. As of August 2014, it was the 54th best-selling single of the 21st century in France, with 382,000 units sold. \"Satisfaction\" is considered to be the forerunner of electro house which brought the genre into the mainstream.\nThe first version of the music video features the three men and the woman in the cover of Hypnotica. It consists of one three-second take of the four people turning to face the camera and smile, played in slow-motion to match the length of the song. Overlaid are various animations including close-up pictures of the lips of a man and a woman singing along to the song. This music video was barely played on music channels, although in some countries, it replaced the \"construction\" version.\nThe second and most famous version of the music video features women in skimpy construction outfits. The video plays almost like a virtual advertisement for a variety of power tools. All are used in a sexual manner. This version was mainly relegated to nighttime hours. It stars British lad mag models Jerri Byrne, Rachel Hallett, Thekla Roth and Natasha Mealey, American Playboy Playmate Suzanne Stokes and British Page 3 girl model turned porn star and escort Lena Franks.\nIn 2008, men from Viborg, Denmark, got together to re-enact the music video with middle-aged men. It gained some popularity in Denmark and was covered on TV.\nOn the International Women's Day in 2011, the women's associations of the General Federation of Belgian Labour and Socialistische Partij Anders released a \"Granny Remake\" of the original video. It was made to raise awareness of the gender pay gap by showing the scantily clad women still working the same jobs at 60\u201370 years of age.\nIn late 2017, cadets at Russia's Ulyanovsk Institute of Civil Aviation marked the end of their term by making a parody of the video that drew on a similar parody four years earlier by British soldiers. Wearing just their uniform caps and ties, belts worn around their shoulders, underwear (with the crotches stuffed) and black boots, the cadets twerked, gyrated suggestively, performed maintenance tasks and cleanup in a fashion similar to the video as the cameraman moved from one to the other in their dormitory. The video, which soon went viral, had strong homoerotic elements and suggestions of BDSM culture.\nOfficials at the institute, described as the oldest and most prestigious pilot training school in Russia, were furious, particularly since the cadets had used school property and worn their uniform caps. \"If they had joked like that at home, nobody would have batted an eyelid\" said Sergey Krasov, the institute's director. Shortly after the video became a subject of national discussion, the Federal Air Transport Agency convened a commission to investigate the video and identify the cadets, believed to be in their first year at the institute, who had made it. \"Frivolous dances in underwear with the uniform cap of the Institute covering the face on the grounds of the aviation university are unacceptable\" the agency said. Any cadets it found to be involved could face expulsion.\nWhile some prominent Russian commentators expressed similar outrage on government-run television channels, many more sympathized with the cadets, and made videos of their own in support of them. Most were from other groups of students at trade schools for farmers, construction workers and emergency services, but the Russian women's biathlon team also made one. A Ukrainian swim club filmed part of its video underwater, and a group of retired women living in a St. Petersburg communal apartment contributed their own. Russian American journalist Masha Gessen wrote in The New Yorker that the videos were an unexpected and widespread protest against the state's anti-LGBT policies. \"Each clip is at once a show of solidarity with a group of young strangers and a show of"

The film producers chose Cornell because they wanted a strong male singer. Cornell and Arnold tried to make the song a replacement theme for the character instead of the \"James Bond theme\" reflecting the agent's inexperience in Casino Royale, as well as an introduction to Daniel Craig's grittier and more emotional portrayal of Bond.\nThe track was leaked onto the Internet on September 20, 2006, and later released as an official single on November 13, 2006 through Interscope Records. It charted in many countries, notably peaking at No. 7 on the UK singles chart. It sold 148,000 copies in 2006 in the UK, and has sold 323,000 digital copies and garnered 3.5 million streams in the U.S. as of 2017. Reviews of the song were positive; it won the Satellite Award and the World Soundtrack Award, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. It was not included in the Casino Royale soundtrack, but appeared on Cornell's second solo album, Carry On.\nLia Vollack, Sony Pictures's President of Music, called Chris Cornell inviting him to make a song for the new Bond movie, which would \"reflect the dramatic new direction of James Bond\", with a \"strong male singer\". Cornell thought it was a strange offer, considering that he was American, and assumed he would perform a secondary song instead of the main theme. Cornell declared he liked the Bond movies, particularly the ones with Sean Connery, but that he \"wasn't really a big fan of the last several movies\". But Daniel Craig's casting as James Bond intrigued him, and he decided to accept. He then went to Prague to visit the film's shooting location, and was impressed with its emotional content when he was shown a rough cut. In Prague he also met the film's composer, David Arnold, who suggested writing a song \"that echoed the film score\".\nThe composers started their writing separately, Cornell in his apartment in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell said, \"It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of wandered around for about a month not thinking about it too much, until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier.\" Later the two musicians met to share their ideas, and according to Arnold \"it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song.\" Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and \"having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape\".\nAfter a demo of the song was approved by the film's producers, both musicians recorded the full version in AIR Studios London. Cornell and Arnold recorded the guitar and bass parts themselves and hired a session musician for the drums. They were finished by the time Casino Royale wrapped its principal photography on July 21, 2006, and Arnold played it at the wrap party. Afterwards he mixed in the orchestral parts.\nSpeaking to the film music fan site Maintitles, Arnold said he wanted \"You Know My Name\" to be a substitute for the James Bond theme, to represent Bond's immaturity. The song's motif is heard throughout the film, and the classic theme plays only during the end credits to signal the end of his character arc. Arnold felt the song should tie closer to the score, and have the \"DNA of the James Bond music\". The musical arrangement tried to create \"the right blend of rock aggression and sophisticated instrumentation\", with Cornell describing it as \"more up-tempo and a little more aggressive than any other Bond theme has been, maybe since Paul McCartney's 'Live and Let Die'.\"\nCornell stated that the biggest two influences on \"You Know My Name\" were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed"

It was written by Ciara, Jasper Cameron, Nayvadius \"Future\" Wilburn, Michael Williams, Pierre Ramon Slaughter, Carlton Mahone, Rodney Terry, and was produced by Mike Will Made It. The song premiered on March 4, 2013, via Billboard.com and was released as a digital download on March 8, 2013, as the lead single of her fifth album. Epic Records serviced the single to Rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States on April 9, 2013. Musically, \"Body Party\" is a down-tempo R&B song that samples \"My Boo\" by Ghost Town DJ's.\n\"Body Party\" received positive reviews from critics who praised the slow synthesized production akin to songs by Prince and R. Kelly. Rolling Stone ranked \"Body Party\" at number 22 for The Best Songs of 2013, which made it the highest RnB song on the list. Upon release, the song charted at number six on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song also debuted at number thirty-five on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached a current peak of twenty-two. The single was also certified double platinum by the RIAA and is Ciara's second multi-platinum single after \"1, 2 Step\".\nThe song's accompanying music video, shot by Director X, tells a story of the first time when Ciara and Future met. Aside from Future, the video featured cameo appearances from artists including Trinidad James and Ludacris. The video received positive reviews from critics as well as from musical peer Nicki Minaj. The song's official remix was released on May 16, 2013 and features Future and B.o.B. Ciara performed the single for the first time on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in June 2013. The video was nominated for Best Choreography at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Treasure by Bruno Mars, but won for \"Best Dance Performance\" at the 2013 Soul Train Music Awards.\nAfter releasing two under performing albums, Fantasy Ride (2009) and Basic Instinct (2010), Ciara publicly asked to be released from her label Jive. In July 2011, reports circulated that Ciara had reunited with  L.A. Reid by signing with his record label Epic Records. Reid had previously signed Ciara to LaFace Records during the beginning of her career and was a factor in the commercial success of her debut album, Goodies (2004). Billboard magazine went on to confirm her move to Epic in September 2011. In February 2012, Ciara revealed that she had begun recording her album. Ciara released three singles from the album \"Sweat\" featuring rapper, 2 Chainz, \"Sorry\" and \"Got Me Good\" all of which performed poorly on any major charts, the three singles were later scrapped with \"Body Party\" being released as the album's lead single.\nOn March 1, 2013, via Twitter, Ciara tweeted, \"My Body Is Your Party Baby...Nobody's Invited but U Baby,\" which was later confirmed to be lyrics from \"Body Party\". The same day, Ciara released the artwork for the single as well as a 42-second snippet. \"Body Party\" had its official premiere on March 4, 2013 on Billboard.com. While speaking to Billboard about the song, Ciara said, \"Let's just say that this record came out of a very sincere place. I think when things just organically feel right, naturally good things come from it\". \"Body Party\" was released as a digital download on March 12, 2013, as the 1st single from Ciara's fifth studio album, Ciara. On the week of March 18, 2013, \"Body Party\" was the most added song on urban radio. It impacted rhythmic radio in the United States on April 9, 2013.\n\"Body Party\" was written by mainly Ciara and Jasper Cameron, with assistance from Future, Michael L. Williams, Pierre Ramon Slaughter, Carlton Mahone, and Rodney Terry. Lasting for three minutes and fifty four seconds and being produced by Mike WiLL Made It, \"Body Party\" is a  mid-tempo R&B song that samples \"My Boo\" (1996) by Ghost Town DJ's. The first verse introduces the concept of the song: \"My body is your party, baby/ Nobody's invited but you baby/ I can do it slow now, tell me what you want.\" According to MTV Buzzworthy, the song is built around the idea of Ciara promising her body to her \"man.\" in this song, Ciara displays a vocal range spanning 2 octaves, from the low note of (E3) to the high belted note of (E5).\n\"Body Party\" received positive reviews, with many praising the production. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse called the song a \"slinky, synthy\" track, while Madeline Boardman of"

The film producers chose Cornell because they wanted a strong male singer. Cornell and Arnold tried to make the song a replacement theme for the character instead of the \"James Bond theme\" reflecting the agent's inexperience in Casino Royale, as well as an introduction to Daniel Craig's grittier and more emotional portrayal of Bond.\nThe track was leaked onto the Internet on September 20, 2006, and later released as an official single on November 13, 2006 through Interscope Records. It charted in many countries, notably peaking at No. 7 on the UK singles chart. It sold 148,000 copies in 2006 in the UK, and has sold 323,000 digital copies and garnered 3.5 million streams in the U.S. as of 2017. Reviews of the song were positive; it won the Satellite Award and the World Soundtrack Award, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. It was not included in the Casino Royale soundtrack, but appeared on Cornell's second solo album, Carry On.\nLia Vollack, Sony Pictures's President of Music, called Chris Cornell inviting him to make a song for the new Bond movie, which would \"reflect the dramatic new direction of James Bond\", with a \"strong male singer\". Cornell thought it was a strange offer, considering that he was American, and assumed he would perform a secondary song instead of the main theme. Cornell declared he liked the Bond movies, particularly the ones with Sean Connery, but that he \"wasn't really a big fan of the last several movies\". But Daniel Craig's casting as James Bond intrigued him, and he decided to accept. He then went to Prague to visit the film's shooting location, and was impressed with its emotional content when he was shown a rough cut. In Prague he also met the film's composer, David Arnold, who suggested writing a song \"that echoed the film score\".\nThe composers started their writing separately, Cornell in his apartment in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell said, \"It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of wandered around for about a month not thinking about it too much, until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier.\" Later the two musicians met to share their ideas, and according to Arnold \"it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song.\" Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and \"having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape\".\nAfter a demo of the song was approved by the film's producers, both musicians recorded the full version in AIR Studios London. Cornell and Arnold recorded the guitar and bass parts themselves and hired a session musician for the drums. They were finished by the time Casino Royale wrapped its principal photography on July 21, 2006, and Arnold played it at the wrap party. Afterwards he mixed in the orchestral parts.\nSpeaking to the film music fan site Maintitles, Arnold said he wanted \"You Know My Name\" to be a substitute for the James Bond theme, to represent Bond's immaturity. The song's motif is heard throughout the film, and the classic theme plays only during the end credits to signal the end of his character arc. Arnold felt the song should tie closer to the score, and have the \"DNA of the James Bond music\". The musical arrangement tried to create \"the right blend of rock aggression and sophisticated instrumentation\", with Cornell describing it as \"more up-tempo and a little more aggressive than any other Bond theme has been, maybe since Paul McCartney's 'Live and Let Die'.\"\nCornell stated that the biggest two influences on \"You Know My Name\" were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed"

It was written by Adele and producer Paul Epworth and features orchestration by J. A. C. Redford. The film company Eon Productions invited the singer to work on the theme song in early 2011, a task that Adele accepted after reading the film's script. While composing the song, Adele and Epworth aimed to capture the mood and style of the other Bond themes, including dark and moody lyrics descriptive of the film's plot. \"Skyfall\" was released at 0:07 BST on 5 October 2012 as part of the Global James Bond Day, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the release of Dr. No, the first James Bond film.\n\"Skyfall\" received universal acclaim, with critics praising its lyrics, production and Adele's vocal performance, with numerous critics and publications ranking it amongst the best Bond themes. The song was a global success, topping the charts in eleven countries and reaching the top five in various other regions. It peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart and number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100. With sales of 7.2 million copies worldwide, \"Skyfall\" is one of the best selling digital singles of all time.\n\"Skyfall\" received various accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Original Song, Brit Award for British Single of the Year, Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song, Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media, thus making it the first Bond theme to win all the aforementioned awards. During the 85th Academy Awards, Adele performed the song live for the first time.\nIn early 2011, Sony Pictures President of Music Lia Vollack suggested to the James Bond film producers at Eon Productions that they ask Adele to record a theme song for their next Bond film, later revealed to be titled Skyfall. Vollack thought that Adele would be a good choice to ask to record a Bond theme song because her music had a \"soulful, haunting, evocative quality\", which Vollack considered would bring back the \"classic Shirley Bassey feel\" associated with several early Bond films.\nAdele, who had just released her second album, 21, admitted that initially she was a \"little hesitant\" about agreeing to write a Bond theme song. On meeting with the Skyfall film crew, the singer had told Skyfall director Sam Mendes that she felt as though she was not the person they were looking for because \"my songs are personal, I write from the heart\". Mendes simply replied \"just write a personal song\", telling her to use Carly Simon's \"Nobody Does It Better\" from The Spy Who Loved Me as an inspiration. Adele left the meeting with the script of Skyfall and upon reading it, decided that it was a \"no-brainer\", as she \"fell in love\" with the film's plot. Producer Paul Epworth, who had worked with Adele on 21, was brought in to help her write the song. Adele stated that she enjoyed working to a brief and set of guidelines, even though it was something she had never done before.\nProduction of \"Skyfall\", from the first contact with Adele to the song's release, took 18 months to complete. Vollack stated that the reason for this was \"fine-tuning\" the song, as Adele and Epworth wanted to ensure that they \"were getting it right\". The first cut of the song was completed in October 2011. During an interview at their post-Academy Award for Best Original Song win in February 2013, Adele revealed that the first draft of the song was written in 10 minutes. After Adele underwent throat microsurgery for vocal problems, she recorded a demo of the track and sent it to Mendes, who was doing the principal photography of Skyfall. The director in turn played the demo for film producer Barbara Broccoli and Bond actor Daniel Craig, both of whom \"shed a tear\". Adele stated that the final cut of the song lasted two studio sessions at Abbey Road Studios in London. It features a 77-piece orchestra conducted by J. A. C. Redford.\n\"Skyfall\" is an orchestral pop song with a duration of four minutes and 46 seconds. Epworth stated that although \"Skyfall\" is an original composition, he and Adele had worked to capture \"the James Bond feeling\" of previous theme songs. The song intentionally references Monty"

It served as her debut single, the first from her self-titled debut album (2002). It was written by Ashanti, 7 Aurelius, Etterlene Jordan, Mark DeBarge and Irv Gotti, while production was overseen by Gotti. The song uses a sample of DeBarge's \"Stay with Me\" and features elements from the remix of \"One More Chance\" by The Notorious B.I.G. and \"M.V.P.\" by Big L. Due to the inclusion of the sample, Mark DeBarge and Etterlene Jordan are also credited as songwriters. A promotional version of the single called \"Unfoolish\" features a verse from Notorious B.I.G. from his song \"F--king You Tonight\".\nThe song was released as the album's lead single on January 29, 2002. It spent ten weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming Ashanti's second number one and third top ten on both charts. Elsewhere, \"Foolish\" became a top ten hit in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The song was nominated for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 2003 Grammy Awards, and won the Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Single \u2013 Female. In 2009, Billboard ranked it 19th on its Hot 100 Songs of the 2000s Decade.\nThe song is performed in the key of C major in common time with a tempo of 89 beats per minute.  It follows a chord progression of Fmaj7\u2013G, and Ashanti's vocals span from A\u2083 to C\u2086.\n\"Foolish\" spent 10 consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard charts and a total of 17 weeks in the top 10. It would later get ranked the second best performing single of 2002, and listed as the 132nd best single.\nThe filming session of the video for the single took place during January 2002. It was directed by Irv Gotti. The video shows the viewer a relationship where a man, played by Terrence Howard, gets involved into some criminal acts after telling his girlfriend [Ashanti] that he is in construction and is unfaithful to Ashanti with Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta reality star Althea, which ends up in a break-up after some quarrel. As the song suggests, Ashanti feels that she still loves her ex and that she just can't seem to get over him and becomes frusturated since her heart and her mind force her to love him and hate him at the same time. In supporting roles we can also see Charli Baltimore, Vita, Ja Rule and Irv Gotti. The video is set in the fashion of the movie Goodfellas, with Ashanti in the role of Karen Hill and Terrence Howard in the role of Henry Hill. Irv Gotti and Ja Rule are also in a scene appearing to take the roles of Jimmy Conway and Paulie Cicero. The video was a three-time nominee at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video, Best R&B Video, and Best New Artist.\nEuropean CD single\n\"Foolish\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:52\n\"Foolish\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:52\nAustralian/US Maxi single\n\"Foolish\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:52\n\"Foolish\" (album version) \u2013 3:48\n\"Foolish\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:51\n\"Foolish\" (video)\nUK 5\" CD single\n\"Foolish\" (album version) \u2013 3:48\n\"Unfoolish\" (clean album version) \u2013 3:15\n\"Foolish\" (Topnotch Remix)\n\"Foolish\" (video)\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Ashanti.\nInstrumentation\u00a0\u2013 7 Aurelius\nMixing\u00a0\u2013 Supa Engineer Duro, Irv Gotti\nProduction\u00a0\u2013 7 Aurelius, Irv Gotti\nSongwriting\u00a0\u2013 7 Aurelius, A.

Hutton. \"The Way That I Love You\" is a song recorded by American singer Ashanti from her fourth studio album, The Declaration (2008). It was released as the album's lead single on February 26, 2008, through Universal and The Inc. Ashanti wrote and produced the song with L.T. Hutton. Backed by piano, guitar, and horns, \"The Way That I Love You\" is a midtempo R&B ballad whose lyrics tell of betrayal. \nCritical response was primarily positive; some reviewers said it was a highlight from The Declaration while others felt it was inferior to music released by Beyonc\u00e9 and Mary J. Blige. Commercially, the song peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and appeared on the publication's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Adult R&B Songs component charts. Ashanti performed \"The Way That I Love You\" at Sessions@AOL and on tour.\nKevin Bray directed the music video which tells the story of Ashanti and her boyfriend\u2014he cheats on her, she discovers it, and she murders him. The story for the video was inspired by the true crime TV shows Snapped and Forensic Files. The video's emphasis on violence attracted critical attention. As part of the song's promotion, Ashanti launched a website that allowed users to create and send a personalized news report and death threat to a contact. The campaign was received negatively and incited a protest in Los Angeles. The website was ultimately taken down.\nFor her fourth studio album The Declaration (2008), Ashanti collaborated with songwriters and producers outside of her record label Murder Inc. Her previous album Concrete Rose (2004) had been overshadowed by negative news regarding the label, including a feud with G-Unit and an FBI investigation. L.T. Hutton produced a majority of The Declaration, instead of Ashanti's longtime producer Irv Gotti. Ashanti said that she had more artistic freedom with the album. Hutton and Ashanti wrote and produced \"The Way That I Love\". Ashanti said that she \"just started jotting down words, and it just kind of poured out\" upon hearing the opening instrumental. She produced the lead and background vocals, and Hutton programmed the song and played the instruments. The final version was mixed at Brandons Way Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. \n\"Switch\", which featured Nelly, and \"Hey Baby (After the Club)\" were both announced as the album's lead single in 2007. They were replaced by \"The Way That I Love You\",  which was released to urban radio on February 26, 2008, and rhythmic radio on April 1, 2008. It was the number one most-added song on urban radio in the week of its release. The single was included on a July 2008 Cartier charity playlist created to support the Boys & Girls Clubs of America organization.\n\"The Way That I Love You\" is a midtempo R&B ballad that lasts four minutes and thirty seconds. It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a \"moderate hip-hop\" tempo. The instrumentation is provided by a piano, a guitar, and horns; Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the single is \"driven by a distinct descending piano arpeggio and horn arrangement\". \nAshanti's vocal range spans from the low note of D\u2084 to the high note of E\u2085. AllMusic's Andy Kellman compared her vocals to her 2003 single \"Rain on Me\" because of their similar \"melodramatic flourishes\" but said the lyrics of \"The Way That I Love You\" were \"much more vengeful in nature than depressive.\" Ashanti felt both men and women would relate to the single's theme of betrayal.\n\"The Way That I Love You\" was praised by critics who identified it as a highlight of The Declaration. The New York Daily News' Jim Farber felt Ashanti's collaboration with Hutton was her best work, and described \"The Way That I Love You\" as a \"strut of a song.\" Noah Berlatsky of the Chicago Reader noted the song's piano loop as one of the few standouts from the album. A Dayton Daily News reviewer summed up the single as \"cliche but effective.\" \nOn the other hand, some commentators negatively compared \"The Way That I Love You\" to music released by other singers. Despite praising Ashanti's performance as emotional, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly found the single to be inferior to those by Beyonc\u00e9 and Mary J. Blige. Vibe's Shanel Odum dismissed the song as \"barely set[ting] off a smoke detector, let alone ring[ing] any alarms\", in a reference to Beyonc\u00e9's 2006 single \"Ring the Alarm\".\nCommercially, \"The Way That I Love You\" peaked at"

Unveiled in a Super Bowl XLVIII television advertisement, it was available as a free digital download through the iTunes Store from 2\u20133 February 2014. Bank of America gave $1 for each download of the track to (RED), an organisation co-founded by Bono, to fight AIDS. Since 4 February, it has been available as a paid download, with all the proceeds also going to (RED). The song was later included as a hidden track on the deluxe edition of the group's 2014 studio album Songs of Innocence.\nThe electronic-tinged rock anthem was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. The song has also charted in several countries, and topped the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs chart in the United States. A music video for the song was directed by Mark Romanek and released on 11 February 2014.\nU2 began work on its 13th studio album, Songs of Innocence, with producer Danger Mouse in 2011. In November 2013, the band released its first new song in four years, \"Ordinary Love\", recorded for the biographical film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom; the second song released after the break was \"Invisible\". However, the latter was not the first official single to promote the album, but rather a \"sort of a sneak preview \u2013 to remind people we exist,\" as lead singer Bono told USA Today. The song also launched a partnership between (RED), an organisation founded by Bono and Bobby Shriver, and Bank of America to fight AIDS.\nOn 16 January 2014, confusion was created when Dave Fanning announced the \"first-time play\" of \"Invisible\" live on The Dave Fanning Show on RT\u00c9 2fm. Instead, a 2012 release titled \"Bad Machine\" from St Albans-based rock band Dark Stares aired twice. Fanning's close relationship with U2 and an over 33-year history of the band's single exclusives, caused many to believe the broadcast was legitimate and added further debate on U2 fan-forums. Several media outlets also reported on the situation, namely Hot Press and radio broadcaster Alan Cross. However, Fanning later hinted that he was partially behind the hoax, saying, \"We did point out that it was a spoof,\" when interviewed by The Sunday Times. To date, neither U2 nor Dark Stares have officially commented on their respective knowledge or involvement in the stunt.\nOn 2 February 2014, part of \"Invisible\" was unveiled in a Super Bowl XLVIII television advertisement, and was made available as a free download from the iTunes Store for 24 hours, with Bank of America giving $1 for each download of the track to (RED) and its recipient, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. According to the band's website, the period of time in which the song was available for free was eventually extended to 36 hours, and the total sum raised was $3,138,470. On 4 February 2014, the song was made available as a regular digital download, with all the proceeds also going to (RED).\nOn 17 February 2014, the band appeared on the debut episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and performed \"Invisible\" on the observation deck of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, with the Manhattan skyline during sunset as a backdrop. The group were accompanied by the Rutgers University drumline.\nAn alternative, longer version of \"Invisible\" was eventually released as a hidden track on the deluxe edition of Songs of Innocence, which was released in October 2014. Doug Collette of All About Jazz commented that the song's \"patently transparent lyrics set in the context of this package and the benefit of brief hindsight, make for a fitting conclusion of deliberate or accidental self-commentary.\"\nAccording to Bono, \"Invisible\" is a song about him \"leaving home with just enough rage to see it through and this feeling of arriving in London, sleeping in the station and coming out into the punk rock explosion that was happening.\" In a radio interview with BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe, he explained that \"there were really wild, extraordinary people and then you feel deeply not extraordinary. You feel invisible and you're screaming to be seen and you've got your band and this is your whole life. It's that feeling of getting out of town.\" Bono also said that during the process of writing material for the new album they \"went back to why we wanted to be in a band in the first place. It opened up a whole valve for me writing and it was a dam burst of sorts. Punk rock and electronic [music] was when it started for us. We were listening to the Ramones and Kraftwerk and you can hear both of those things on"

It served as her debut single, the first from her self-titled debut album (2002). It was written by Ashanti, 7 Aurelius, Etterlene Jordan, Mark DeBarge and Irv Gotti, while production was overseen by Gotti. The song uses a sample of DeBarge's \"Stay with Me\" and features elements from the remix of \"One More Chance\" by The Notorious B.I.G. and \"M.V.P.\" by Big L. Due to the inclusion of the sample, Mark DeBarge and Etterlene Jordan are also credited as songwriters. A promotional version of the single called \"Unfoolish\" features a verse from Notorious B.I.G. from his song \"F--king You Tonight\".\nThe song was released as the album's lead single on January 29, 2002. It spent ten weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming Ashanti's second number one and third top ten on both charts. Elsewhere, \"Foolish\" became a top ten hit in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The song was nominated for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 2003 Grammy Awards, and won the Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Single \u2013 Female. In 2009, Billboard ranked it 19th on its Hot 100 Songs of the 2000s Decade.\nThe song is performed in the key of C major in common time with a tempo of 89 beats per minute.  It follows a chord progression of Fmaj7\u2013G, and Ashanti's vocals span from A\u2083 to C\u2086.\n\"Foolish\" spent 10 consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard charts and a total of 17 weeks in the top 10. It would later get ranked the second best performing single of 2002, and listed as the 132nd best single.\nThe filming session of the video for the single took place during January 2002. It was directed by Irv Gotti. The video shows the viewer a relationship where a man, played by Terrence Howard, gets involved into some criminal acts after telling his girlfriend [Ashanti] that he is in construction and is unfaithful to Ashanti with Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta reality star Althea, which ends up in a break-up after some quarrel. As the song suggests, Ashanti feels that she still loves her ex and that she just can't seem to get over him and becomes frusturated since her heart and her mind force her to love him and hate him at the same time. In supporting roles we can also see Charli Baltimore, Vita, Ja Rule and Irv Gotti. The video is set in the fashion of the movie Goodfellas, with Ashanti in the role of Karen Hill and Terrence Howard in the role of Henry Hill. Irv Gotti and Ja Rule are also in a scene appearing to take the roles of Jimmy Conway and Paulie Cicero. The video was a three-time nominee at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video, Best R&B Video, and Best New Artist.\nEuropean CD single\n\"Foolish\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:52\n\"Foolish\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:52\nAustralian/US Maxi single\n\"Foolish\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:52\n\"Foolish\" (album version) \u2013 3:48\n\"Foolish\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:51\n\"Foolish\" (video)\nUK 5\" CD single\n\"Foolish\" (album version) \u2013 3:48\n\"Unfoolish\" (clean album version) \u2013 3:15\n\"Foolish\" (Topnotch Remix)\n\"Foolish\" (video)\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Ashanti.\nInstrumentation\u00a0\u2013 7 Aurelius\nMixing\u00a0\u2013 Supa Engineer Duro, Irv Gotti\nProduction\u00a0\u2013 7 Aurelius, Irv Gotti\nSongwriting\u00a0\u2013 7 Aurelius, A.

The song features a guest appearance from British YouTuber and rapper KSI and uncredited vocals from British singer-songwriter Ella Henderson. It was released for digital download and streaming by Atlantic Records and Warner Music Group on 24 July 2020 as a standalone single. An upbeat, feel-good house track, its lyrics are about leaving a toxic relationship and feeling happy that the relationship has ended and not carrying a burden.\nAn accompanying music video was released on 24 July 2020. The light-hearted video stars Dawe and KSI among a cast, playing basketball and football. The group start out completely useless at both sports, though they improve as the video progresses. An acoustic version of \"Lighter\", which credits Henderson and features a new verse by KSI, was released on 28 August 2020 alongside an accompanying music video.\n\"Lighter\" received positive reviews from music critics, who commonly praised the song's catchiness and KSI's energetic verse, and it was dubbed \"one of the hits of the summer\". The song peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart and it further charted in eight other countries. \"Lighter\" was one of the UK's best-selling songs of 2020 and it has been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for exceeding sales of 600,000 units in the country. \"Lighter\" was nominated for the BRIT Award for Song of the Year at the 2021 ceremony.\nElla Henderson wrote \"Lighter\" with British songwriter Jonny Lattimer. The song was \"ballady and slow\" which \"didn't fit her artist profile at the time\". Henderson \"had a lot of other releases planned and it wasn't really right for her\". She sent the song to Nathan Dawe, who \"sped it up, pitched the vocal up and completely transformed it\". Henderson \"thought it was sick and wished [Dawe] luck with it\". Dawe and his management felt that \"Lighter\" should feature a verse from a British rapper, similar to his previous single \"Flowers\" (2019), which features British rapper Jaykae, leading to the decision to feature KSI on \"Lighter\". Dawe explained, \"I've known of KSI for a long time and I've been quite a fan of his work... His music recently that's started to come out, the quality [of it has] been really good... I was listening to [his album] thinking, 'KSI's actually sick!' So I [asked] my manager, \"What do you think? Would [KSI] work?' [My manager said], 'Let's reach out [to him].'\" They sent the track to KSI, who listened to it and \"thought it was an absolute banger\" and agreed to \"jump on it\". KSI recalled, \"When I heard [the song], I thought, 'This is a smash!' I knew instantly what I needed to do to elevate it to another level.\" KSI wrote a verse for \"Lighter\" at his home in London. He recalled that \"it took [him] a couple of hours to write the verse\". He recorded the verse at an arranged recording studio session which \"took less than an hour\". Dawe could not be present at the recording studio due to COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions, but he spectated the session via Zoom.\n\"Lighter\" is an upbeat house track. Henderson's vocals are sped-up and pitched-up. She sings about leaving a toxic relationship and feeling happy that the relationship has ended and not carrying a burden. The lyrics give inspiration to those who are struggling through a breakup, heartbreak, or even through losing a toxic person in their life, and feeling better despite the hard times. Henderson's chorus builds up to a piano-house drop. KSI's energetic rap verse is introduced in the break of the track, leading to \"Lighter\" being labelled as a crosssover of house and rap. Dawe described \"Lighter\" as \"a summer anthem [with] a feel-good vibe\". The staff of Sport Playlists similarly described \"Lighter\" as an \"anthemic slice of feel-good dance music\" that was \"written with summer in mind\".\nOn 12 July 2020, Dawe announced via social media that he would soon be releasing a new single. The song's title, featured artist, cover art and release date were revealed three days later and \"Lighter\" was made"

The song serves as the fifth international single from the album, and was released in Australia on January 29, 2010, in the United Kingdom on March 15 and in the United States on May 11. The song peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming the fifth top ten hit from the album.\nCo-produced by French DJ/producer David Guetta, the song heavily samples from Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's \"It Takes Two\", making use of the line \"I wanna rock right now\" multiple times, as well as the drum break, and part of the \"Yeah! Woo!\" line. The Black Eyed Peas use Auto-Tune throughout the song, and Fergie's voice has been notably high-pitched. Spin described \"Rock That Body\" as \"trance-y\". The song is most known to critics as a robotic party track on the album. The song has been compared to be stylistically similar to Flo Rida, whose song \"Club Can't Handle Me\" (from the motion picture Step Up 3D) Guetta would later go on to produce.\nFraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog gave \"Rock That Body\" three out of five stars and called it \"a party banger\". \"Rock That Body\" was well-reviewed by Mike Schiller of PopMatters. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating: \"It's got plenty of pounding beats, synths that sound like they've been filled with Red Bull and more twisted vocal effects than an mp3 of Akon cutting loose in a vocoder factory. It's pretty simple stuff and it will no doubt grate something rotten on the 36th listen...\"\nThe song was a success, reaching the top ten in many countries and top twenty in a number of others, too. \nOn the US Billboard Hot 100, the song peaked at number nine, making it their fifth consecutive top ten hit. For airplay, it proved to be their lowest-charting song since non-single \"Gone Going\" from their fourth studio album Monkey Business (2005), released to radio stations in early 2006.\nThe video was filmed on January 13, 2010, at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California. Directed by Rich Lee, it was shot back to back with the video for \"Imma Be\", the fourth song on The E.N.D. The two songs were mashed up into a medley, which is titled \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\". The medley length is 8:15 and the music video in total is 10:21. It premiered on Vevo and Dipdive on Tuesday, February 16, 2010. The videos were separated for music channels with the introduction and conclusion removed. The video is described as a futuristic Wizard of Oz. It is the sequel for the \"Imma Be\" video and the second half of the \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\" video. It begins with the Black Eyed Peas and their good robot arriving at a city, the people in the city are stuck in a glitch. The 4 members of the group shoot them with their stereo-guns to end their loop so they could continue dancing. As things are going well, the bad robot appears and kidnaps Fergie, will.i.am chases after it with his own robot while Fergie fights the bad robot and the other two members free the remaining people. After many failed attempts, will.i.am manages to shoot the bad robot, which starts dancing with the good robot. The video ends as the bad robot runs out of energy and faints. The \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\" video closes with a scene which reveals the entire story to be Fergie's dream as the other members find her barely conscious following her motorcycle accident in the introduction. As they check to see if she is okay, Fergie excitedly begins to tell them of her idea for their next music video.\nUK CD Single\nDigital Download E.P.\nSongwriting - will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, Fergie, David Guetta, Mark Knight, Adam Walder, Jean Baptiste, Jamie Munson, Robert Ginyard\nVocals - will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, Fergie\nProduction - David Guetta, will.i.am, Mark Knight, Funkagenda\nKeyboards - Mark Night, Adam Walder, will.i.am\nGuitar, additional keyboards, additional vocals - Hal Ritson\nArrangement - will.i.am\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n\nList of number-one dance hits of 2010 (UK)\nFMQB: Radio Industry News, Music Industry Updates, Arbitron Ratings, Music News and more!\n[14339,93949]\nGill, Andy (June 12, 2009). \"Album: The Black Eyed Peas, The E.N.D.

The song features a guest appearance from British YouTuber and rapper KSI and uncredited vocals from British singer-songwriter Ella Henderson. It was released for digital download and streaming by Atlantic Records and Warner Music Group on 24 July 2020 as a standalone single. An upbeat, feel-good house track, its lyrics are about leaving a toxic relationship and feeling happy that the relationship has ended and not carrying a burden.\nAn accompanying music video was released on 24 July 2020. The light-hearted video stars Dawe and KSI among a cast, playing basketball and football. The group start out completely useless at both sports, though they improve as the video progresses. An acoustic version of \"Lighter\", which credits Henderson and features a new verse by KSI, was released on 28 August 2020 alongside an accompanying music video.\n\"Lighter\" received positive reviews from music critics, who commonly praised the song's catchiness and KSI's energetic verse, and it was dubbed \"one of the hits of the summer\". The song peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart and it further charted in eight other countries. \"Lighter\" was one of the UK's best-selling songs of 2020 and it has been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for exceeding sales of 600,000 units in the country. \"Lighter\" was nominated for the BRIT Award for Song of the Year at the 2021 ceremony.\nElla Henderson wrote \"Lighter\" with British songwriter Jonny Lattimer. The song was \"ballady and slow\" which \"didn't fit her artist profile at the time\". Henderson \"had a lot of other releases planned and it wasn't really right for her\". She sent the song to Nathan Dawe, who \"sped it up, pitched the vocal up and completely transformed it\". Henderson \"thought it was sick and wished [Dawe] luck with it\". Dawe and his management felt that \"Lighter\" should feature a verse from a British rapper, similar to his previous single \"Flowers\" (2019), which features British rapper Jaykae, leading to the decision to feature KSI on \"Lighter\". Dawe explained, \"I've known of KSI for a long time and I've been quite a fan of his work... His music recently that's started to come out, the quality [of it has] been really good... I was listening to [his album] thinking, 'KSI's actually sick!' So I [asked] my manager, \"What do you think? Would [KSI] work?' [My manager said], 'Let's reach out [to him].'\" They sent the track to KSI, who listened to it and \"thought it was an absolute banger\" and agreed to \"jump on it\". KSI recalled, \"When I heard [the song], I thought, 'This is a smash!' I knew instantly what I needed to do to elevate it to another level.\" KSI wrote a verse for \"Lighter\" at his home in London. He recalled that \"it took [him] a couple of hours to write the verse\". He recorded the verse at an arranged recording studio session which \"took less than an hour\". Dawe could not be present at the recording studio due to COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions, but he spectated the session via Zoom.\n\"Lighter\" is an upbeat house track. Henderson's vocals are sped-up and pitched-up. She sings about leaving a toxic relationship and feeling happy that the relationship has ended and not carrying a burden. The lyrics give inspiration to those who are struggling through a breakup, heartbreak, or even through losing a toxic person in their life, and feeling better despite the hard times.

The single was released on 11 May 2018 by Atlantic Records. It was written by Ora, Klenord Raphael, Ali Tamposi, Rexha, Jonny Coffer, Jordan Thorpe, Belcalis Almanzar, Brian Lee, Watt and Benjamin Diehl, while the production was handled by Ben Billions, Coffer and Watt.\nThe collaboration was announced on 4 May 2018. Rita Ora described the song as an \"empowering anthem\":\n\"These past few years I've been so inspired by all the strong women I've seen who aren't afraid to be themselves. For those who aren't afraid to rule the world, this is our anthem. A celebration of love. And of course, thank you to all the fellow boss women who so kindly graced this song with me \u2014 each representing who they are and where they are from [...]\"\nIn an interview with People, Ora revealed that the song was inspired by Katy Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl\", which she described as: \"just such a statement; it was so fun\".\n\"Girls\" is a pop song that comprises a hip hop-influenced beat. The lyrics explore themes of same-sex attraction.\nThe music video for \"Girls\" was released on 6 June 2018. It was directed by Helmi.\nOra performed the song live for the first time at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend on 28 May 2017, with Charli XCX and Raye, one year before its release as an official single. Her first televised performance was on the season finale of Germany's Next Topmodel on 24 May 2018.\nAmerican singers Hayley Kiyoko and Kehlani, both of whom identify as lesbians, criticized the song for being \"harmful\" to the LGBTQ community. Kiyoko referred to the song in a tweet she posted as being \"tone-deaf\", stating that the song \"fueled the male gaze while marginalizing the idea of women loving women.\" Kehlani voiced her opinion in a series of tweets, \"I have an incredible song out with one of the artists, and would love to work with the other three as well. I have met them all and respect them. There. Were. Harmful. Lyrics.\" She concluded her tweets with: \"Every artist on the song is fantastic, and very much loved and supported by me... by all of us. But this isn't about talent, it's about choice.\" Several days later, Ora apologized for unintended offense. Ora responded to criticism, as she wrote: \"'Girls' was written to represent my truth and is an accurate account of a very real and honest experience in my life... I have had romantic relationships with women and men throughout my life and this is my personal journey\".\nDigital download\n\"Girls\" (featuring Cardi B, Bebe Rexha and Charli XCX) \u2013 3:41\nDigital download\n\"Girls\" (featuring Cardi B, Bebe Rexha and Charli XCX) (Martin Jensen Remix) \u2013 4:20\nDigital download\n\"Girls\" (featuring Cardi B, Bebe Rexha and Charli XCX) (Steve Aoki Remix) \u2013 3:45\n\n\n\n\n\nRexha is not credited as a writer on Phoenix booklet, although she is listed as a writer in BMI repertoire.\n\"BMI Repertoire \u2013 Girls\".

It was released as the first single from their fourth album Issues, debuting in an episode of Comedy Central's animated series South Park, entitled \"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery\". The song went on to become one of Korn's most popular singles, with an anti-child abuse themed video topping MTV's Total Request Live for ten days.\nJonathan Davis explained: \"The song is about domestic abuse and that there are ways to get help whether it's telling someone or calling a help line, there are ways to get out of those situations. No one has to be treated like that.\"\nThe music video for \"Falling Away from Me\" received its world premiere on MTV in November 26, 1999 during Spankin' New Music Week. It begins as a continuation of the famous video for \"Freak on a Leash\", starting with its closing animation. The video then transitions into live action as it shows a young girl (played by actress Jill Noel) clearly distraught by her abusive father. Inside her room, she opens a box and appears to see the band inside, performing below hanging lightbulbs. A crowd of young people have gathered outside the window, raising their arms in time to the beat as the band is then surrounded by flashes of green electricity, and then appear inside her bedroom with flashes of red electricity. As her father angrily approaches her room with a belt in his hand, one of the youths appears outside her window and helps her get outside. She leaves the house as the song ends and the crowd scatters. The band dissolves into red electricity and goes straight back into the box in her hands. She then runs off into the night just as her father finally opens the door to see her empty bedroom. The video ends with a shot of the neighborhood with red lights showing in one bedroom in every house.\nIn the original version of the video, shortly before the band disappears into the box (once the teenage girl escapes through the window), Fred Durst made a \"cameo\" appearance in the video \u2013 his face appearing for a brief moment during one of the close-up shots of Jonathan Davis. Due to reasons which are somewhat unclear (it's rumoured that Davis spotted the cameo and objected), subsequent versions of the video have had the Fred Durst cameo removed.\nThe video enjoyed similar success to its predecessor, \"Freak on a Leash\", debuting on MTV's Total Request Live at number three, and reaching number one on its seventh day.

It was released in 1986 as the third single from the album Different Light.  It was the band's first number one single, being certified gold by the RIAA, and became Billboard's number-one song of 1987.\nLiam Sternberg, who wrote the song, had finished a demo version by January 1984 with singer Marti Jones. He offered it to Toni Basil, who turned it down. Lene Lovich recorded the first version of the song, but it went unreleased when she decided to take a break from music to raise her family. David Kahne from Peer Southern Publishing was the producer of Different Light; he received a copy of the demo and liked it, especially Jones's \"offhand quality\".\nKahne took the song to the Bangles, who agreed to record it. He had each member of the group sing the lyrics to determine who would sing each verse; Vicki Peterson, Michael Steele, and Susanna Hoffs sang lead vocals in the final version on the first, second, and third verses, respectively. Kahne particularly disliked Debbi Peterson's leads, so she was relegated to backing vocals. This angered her and caused tension within the group. The situation was exacerbated by the use of a drum machine in place of her drumming, further diminishing her role in the song. She can be seen playing the tambourine during their 1986 performance on The Old Grey Whistle Test. The whistling in the song was actually played by a machine.\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was released as the third single from Different Light. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1986. The song reached a peak of number three on the UK Singles Chart in November 1986 and reached number one in the US on December 20, staying at the top of the Hot 100 for four weeks, carrying it over into January 1987. The success of the song and \"Manic Monday\" propelled Different Light to number two on the Billboard 200 chart, making it the group's most successful album.\nThe music video for \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was nominated for Best Group Video at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards. It features both the Bangles performing the song at a concert and scenes of people dancing in  poses similar to those depicted in the Ancient Egyptian reliefs that inspired songwriter Liam Sternberg. Most of these people were filmed on the streets of New York City, although special effects were used to modify photos of Princess Diana, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and the Statue of Liberty. In a popular scene from the video, Hoffs was filmed in a close-up where her eyes moved from side to side, looking left and right. When asked about the scene in an interview, Hoffs explained that she was looking at individual audience members during the video shoot, which took place with a live audience. Looking directly at individual audience members was a technique she used to overcome stage fright, and she was unaware that the camera had a close-up on her while she was employing this technique, switching between one audience member on her left and one on her right.\nIn 1990, \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was re-issued as a single in the UK to promote the Bangles' Greatest Hits album. It featured new remixes for the song called Ozymandias Remix. It charted at number 73 in the UK.\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was one of the songs which were claimed to have been banned by Clear Channel following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Snopes in researching this found that the list was simply suggestions regarding songs to be sensitive about when deciding what to play. It was also included in a \"list of records to be avoided\" drawn up by the BBC during the Gulf War.\n(*) indicates the list is unordered.\n1985 release\n7\" single\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (3:21)\n\"Angels Don't Fall in Love\" (3:21)\n12\" maxi\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (extended dance mix) (5:48)\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (dub mix) (5:17)\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (a capella mix) (2:47)\n1986 release\n7\" single\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (3:21)\n\"Not Like You\" (3:05)\n12\" maxi\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (extended dance mix) (5:48)\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (dub mix) (5:17)\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (a cappella mix) (2:47)\n\"Angels Don't Fall in Love\" (3:21)\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1986\nList of Billboard Year-End number-one singles and albums\nList of Hot 100 Airplay number-one singles of the 1980s\nList of number-one singles in Australia during the"

She also co-produced it with Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. The track samples Queen's \"We Will Rock You\" (1977) and features electric guitar by Queen's Brian May. Gaga debuted \"You and I\" in June 2010 during her performance at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet, and positive response encouraged her to include the song on her setlist for The Monster Ball Tour. She later performed the song on Today  to a record crowd in July 2010, and on The Oprah Winfrey Show in May 2011. On August 23, 2011, Interscope Records released the song as the fourth single from the album.\n\"You and I\" is a downtempo song featuring instrumentation from electric guitars and piano, with Gaga and Lange providing background vocals. The song received critical acclaim, with reviewers listing it as one of the highlights from Born This Way. After the release of the parent album, \"You and I\" charted in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, due to digital downloads from the parent album. After being released as a single, \"You and I\" reached the top ten in the US, Japan, and seven additional countries. The song was also certified Triple Platinum in the US for selling three million units. Season ten American Idol contestant Haley Reinhart performed \"You and I\" in May 2011 before its release, earning positive reviews. Her studio recording was released to the iTunes Store as a single, and appeared on the compilation album, American Idol Top 5 Season 10. \"You and I\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards, which was held on February 12, 2012.\nThe accompanying music video for \"You and I\" was also met with a positive response. It was shot by Gaga's long-time collaborator Laurieann Gibson in Springfield, Nebraska, and it was released on August 16, 2011. It features Y\u00fcyi, Gaga's  mermaid alter ego, and Jo Calderone, Gaga's male alter ego, who also appears on the single's cover. Gaga later performed the song dressed as Jo Calderone at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. The song has subsequently been performed on the singer's concert tours and residencies.\n\"Yo\u00fc and I\", written by Lady Gaga and produced by Gaga and Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, was one of the first songs previewed from the album. Gaga said she wrote the song in New York, while she was busy playing her old piano. The singer first played \"Yo\u00fc and I\" at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball in June 2010. She said that the song was a bit of a \"rock-and-roll tune\" and, as such, was unlikely to be released as a single from Born This Way. She said  that it \"is very dear\" to her heart. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet soon after, and positive response encouraged Lady Gaga to perform the song during the first concert of the North American leg of The Monster Ball Tour in Montreal. Gaga told MSNBC's Meredith Vieira and Ann Curry that \"'Yo\u00fc and I' was written about the most important person that I ever met\", allegedly L\u00fcc Carl, her ex-boyfriend.\nGaga announced \"Yo\u00fc and I\" as the fourth single from Born This Way on July 22, 2011. Its cover, released on August 5, 2011, via TwitPic, was accompanied by the line: \"You will never find what you are looking for in love, if you don't love yourself.\" It features two black-and-white images of Gaga's male alter ego Jo Calderone smoking a cigarette and sporting sideburns. The Calderone character made a previous appearance in June 2011, when Gaga posed as him in London for a series of photos by photographer Nick Knight, arranged by stylist Nicola Formichetti. One shot features him wearing a blazer and white T-shirt with his head down smoking a cigarette. The other image is of Jo Calderone in silhouette exhaling a cloud of smoke.\nA writer for Australia's The Daily Telegraph described the images as having a moody and scruffy look, and felt that Gaga had become \"bored with being an outrageous woman and has decided to switch gender instead.\" Rap-Up's David Jones commented that Gaga's Calderone character appearing on the cover looked similar to musician Bob Dylan. Steve Pond of Reuters stated about the artwork: \"Lady Gaga loves herself even when she's dressed as a guy.\"\n\"You and I\" has rock and country music influences, and"

It was released on August 21, 2015, through Sony Music Nashville, as the album's lead single. It was written by Underwood, Chris DeStefano, and Hillary Lindsey, and was produced by Jay Joyce. Musically, it has lyrics about escaping life's many stresses.\n\"Smoke Break\" was met with critical acclaim, with music critics describing it as \"a homage to hard working people in need of a breather\". It quickly became a commercial success, setting an all-time record for the largest first-week adds at country radio. It went on to reach number one on the Billboard Canada Country chart and number two on the Billboard Country Airplay chart in the US, becoming her 20th top-two single on the chart.\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Randee St. Nicholas and won the 2016 CMT Music Award for Female Video of the Year. The song received its first televised performance at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, on September 10, 2015.\n\"Smoke Break\" is a country rock song that critics have described as \"a homage to hard working people in need of a breather\". It has lyrics about escaping life's many stresses. About the writing process, Underwood stated that she, Chris DeStefano and Hillary Lindsey \"were writing and kept taking breaks to go outside because we were getting a little stuck on a song we were already working on. It was so beautiful outside that we had a hard time focusing, so we decided to write a song about taking breaks! 'Smoke Break' seemed like a great title, so we ran with it!\"\n\"Smoke Break\" has received rave reviews from music critics. Grady Smith of UK's The Guardian acclaimed it, by stating \"among all the great music we've been treated to this summer, no song has carried more significance than Carrie Underwood\u2019s excellent new single 'Smoke Break'. Here we have an A-list star releasing an unabashed country rock song that isn't trying to chase any sonic trends\". He also added that Underwood \"has emerged as the leader of country music\". Denise Quan of Rolling Stone praised the song, saying that the singer \"pays homage to hard working people in need of a breather\" and adding that Underwood puts \"a bit more twang in her vocals than usual \u2014 a welcome dose of laid-back country cool after a string of glossy, high-octane arena rockers and soaring ballads\". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard awarded it 3.5 starts out of a possible five, noting Underwood's departure from previous material and stating that \"the normally overpolished American Idol winner wears the song's blue-collar country-rock vibe well\". Hugh McIntyre of Forbes praised it, saying its lines evokes \"some pretty sentimental themes that likely connect with a lot of people\" and the song \"has the makings of another runaway hit on radio\".\nDee Lockett of Vulture praised it, pointing out that \"just as songs about getting trashed will remain a rite of passage in country music, its superstars like Carrie Underwood will continue to find ways to keep them meaningful\". Kevin John of Country Universe praised Underwood's songwriting by saying that \"she has the finest singing voice of her generation, but her greatest gift is her ability to express empathy for others through song\". Taste of Country praised the song as well, stating that \"it's a song everyone can relate to\" and \"is easy to wear, and adaptable to life's changing circumstances\", and praised Underwood's delivery, saying \"she starts soft before soaring into the chorus\". Robert Christgau deemed it as Storyteller's most impressive song, \"cross-regional, cross-gender, class-conscious ... in which neither the mother of four working three jobs nor the farm family's first college man can do without the occasional drag or drink, sincere Christians though they be\".\nWSM-FM and WKDF Nashville Program Director Charlie Cook praised the song as well, saying \"the lyrics\naddress the hectic lives everyone now lives, and the production stands out as a testament that she is willing to take chances, yet play within what her fans expect\". iHeartMedia Senior VP of Programming Gator Harrison said the song is \u201can anthem for the overwhelmed, something we can all relate to, and amen. It's a smash\".\n\"Smoke Break\" garnered some controversy upon its release, after some listeners accused the song of \"trying to promote smoking\".

It was released on August 8, 2005, as the first single from their fifth studio album All the Right Reasons. The song made multiple US and UK top 10 charts, reaching No. 1 in several of them.\nThe song is mostly autobiographical. Singer Chad Kroeger said, \"It's just nostalgia, growing up in a small town, and you can't go back to your childhood. Saying goodbye to friends that you've drifted away from, where you grew up, where you went to school, who you hung out with and the dumb stuff you used to do as a kid, the first love \u2014 all of those things. Everyone has one or two of those memories that they are fond of, so this song is really just the bridge for all that.\"\nKroeger said the photograph he holds up in the music video of himself and his friend Joey Moi with a champagne chiller on Joey's head is the same one he referred to in the lyrics. He also admitted he had broken into his high school to steal money from the office safe eleven times, but \"half a dozen\" flowed better for the lyrics.\nThe single became the band's third top ten hit in the United States, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. (Held from the top spot by Kanye West's \"Gold Digger\") \"Photograph\" has sold over 1.4 million digital downloads in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan, though it is certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. \"Photograph\", was the first of three top ten hits from All the Right Reasons in New Zealand, peaking at number 4.\nThe song also topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks and Pop 100 charts. The single was also a huge success on the Canadian charts, peaking at number-one and staying there for seven weeks.\nIn 2008, the single was once again showing on future single release lists in the UK. The single was re-released on 23 June 2008 to capitalise on the success of \"Rockstar\". \"Photograph\" was added to the C-list at BBC Radio 1 on 21 May 2008, climbing to the B-list the following week, and then to the A-List. It was also added to the BBC Radio 2 C-list. \"Photograph\" originally peaked at number 29 upon its first release, three years earlier. The song re-entered the UK Singles Chart at number 52 on 10 June 2008, climbed to number 29 a week later and reached a peak of number 18, two weeks after the physical release, out peaking the original release of the song.\nThe music video begins with Chad Kroeger, the video's protagonist, walking along a lonely, sparsely populated street, holding up a photograph of himself and Nickelback's producer, Joey Moi (who is referred to in the line \"And what the hell is on Joey's head?\"). As the song progresses to the line \"And this is where I grew up,\" he walks to a rusty mailbox, addressed as number 29025. As he speaks of sneaking out, the camera does not show the house itself but does show a view from the inside looking out at him, possibly suggesting someone else lives there now. He continues walking and comes to an older building marked as \"Hanna High School\" on the front (it's now the Community Services Building: 210 6 Avenue East, Hanna, Alberta, Canada) announcing, \"And this is where I went to school.\" He and his three other band members enter the gym with their gear and put on a seemingly impromptu concert alone. During the chorus, two band members go to an old junkyard and reminisce about a field where the rest of the band and their girlfriends are partying. Another experiences a similar event near an abandoned train yard, seeing his old girlfriend (most likely Kim, who was \"the first girl I kissed\") run near the tracks and kiss his younger self. The Hanna Roundhouse is shown. The camera then switches to flashbacks of various people (\"I miss that town, I miss the faces\") As the video ends, the flashback people get in their cars to go home as the band finishes the song.\nThe video was directed by Nigel Dick and was filmed in Hanna, Alberta, Canada, hometown to most of the band.\nOne particular shot from the video, with Kroeger holding up a picture frame at the lyric \"Look at this photograph\", became an Internet meme, with users replacing the contents of the frame with other pictures. At the time of the song's release the meme has been part of the general negative attitudes towards the band, and as attitudes towards the band shifted towards more favorable"

The video was co-directed by Dean Karr and Jay Martin (Karr directed the performance scenes while Martin did the narrative scenes).\nIt begins with a man, played by Dennis Connolly, lying in bed while he has a flashback of himself gathering his personal effects upon release from prison. His girlfriend, played by Nina Sanchez, picks him up after his release; they hug and hold hands along the way. After a time they stop at a store. While he is inside, she has a flashback to when she first heard the news of his arrest, and we see that she was pregnant at the time. Dennis gets back in the car with a stuffed rabbit. They then arrive at her home, and there is a young girl inside, presumably the couple's daughter. Nina explains something to the girl while he waits outside. Dennis enters and gives the toy to his daughter, whom he has never met before. After a reluctant moment, the two hug.\nThe video cuts back to the couple lying in bed, and they seem to be distant; when he attempts to touch her, she pulls away. Intercut with this scene is Dennis looking for a job, which proves to be unsuccessful. He walks by and enters several stores, none of which are hiring. He passes a jewelry store, and all the recent positive events flash before him: his release, his daughter, and a rosary. He then notices a \"Help Wanted\" sign and inquires inside the garage; he gets the job as a car mechanic. He again passes the jewelry store, and sees brief flashes of the couple making love, his booking photos and a cross; he hides his face so the owner does not recognize him, implying that he was arrested for trying to rob the jewelry store. He is then working in the shop, apparently now employed. One night, as his girlfriend waits for him \u2014 visibly upset \u2014 Dennis is shown entering the jewelry store, looking at first as if he is going to rob it again. When he finally arrives home, Nina opens the door wondering where he's been, Dennis drops to one knee and proposes to her with a wedding ring; Nina is overjoyed, and the video ends with the two embracing.\nIntercut throughout the video are scenes with scenes of the band playing the song in an immaculate looking grand room, it is of the main atrium of the Surrogate's Courthouse in New York City.\n\nMost critics found \"It's Not Over\" to be catchy and a solid first single.

There has been some talk of the single's similarity to the Fuel song, \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\", which Chris Daughtry performed on American Idol.\nOn December 6, 2007, the song was nominated for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.\nThe single debuted fairly high on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 65 in late November 2006, partly due to the song already reaching the top 40 on iTunes.

It was co-written by Timberlake and the Neptunes (Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams), who also produced it. The song was released on September 16, 2002, as Timberlake's debut solo single, following the announced hiatus of NSYNC earlier that year. According to Williams, the song's drums were an ode to the funk era.\nThe song peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number two in the United Kingdom. It was performed by Timberlake at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City, on August 29, 2002. It also received a nomination at the Grammy Awards of 2003 for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.\nMTV News reported in July 2002 that Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams (known collectively as the Neptunes) were working on multiple tracks for Justified. When the duo picked Timberlake up from his hotel in Virginia Beach, they listened to Earth, Wind & Fire albums during the car ride. The background of the songs was the feeling the duo wanted to implement into the musical content of the album. In response to this, Timberlake said: \"Nobody's ever heard anything like that before ... a white boy singing this kind of music.\" Hugo revealed that Timberlake \"didn't care what people would say.\" The production duo commented that despite not being content with sampling music, for inspiration, they listened to both Off the Wall and Thriller, albums by Michael Jackson. Hugo commented that \"We just wanted to re-create that sense of those timeless, classic songs, without any of the 'bling, bling, hit me on my two-way' style of the new R&B. It has elements of the old and the new.\"\n\"Like I Love You\" was the first song they recorded together and the first song Timberlake recorded for Justified. The song was written by Timberlake, Hugo and Williams, while the production was done by the latter two. The song features a rap verse written and performed by hip hop duo Clipse. \"Like I Love You\" was recorded at Master Sound Recording Studios and Windmark Recording both located in Virginia Beach with Andrew Coleman serving as a recording engineer. Serban Ghenea mixed the song at Windmark Recording, while Daniel Botancourt and Tim Roberts were additional engineers. John Hanes provided the additional Pro Tools engineering. All the instrumentation was delivered by Hugo and Williams, while the song's vocal arrangement was provided by Williams together with Timberlake.\n\"Like I Love You\" was chosen as Timberlake's debut single and the lead single of Justified. According to Timberlake, there was \"never any question\" in his mind whether or not the song would be released as his debut single. Of the song, Timberlake said: \"It sounded so original to me. And I kind of consider myself a new artist. This is a new beginning for me, so why call on some big-name hip-hop artist when I could get somebody that feels new so it could feel like we were chomping at the bit at the same time?\"\nOn October 14, 2002, a CD single was released in Germany containing the album version of the song, its instrumental and two club extended mixes. The same version of the single was released in Canada on October 17, 2002. In the UK, the album version of \"Like I Love You\", its instrumental and one extended remix was physically released on October 21, 2002. The song was released as a 12-inch single on November 19, 2002, in Italy and Spain. On November 24, 2002, it was also released in France as a CD single.\nThe song received positive reviews from music critics. Entertainment Weekly's Craig Seymour wrote \"Over a lo-fi Neptunes-produced track dashed with Spanish guitar, live drums, and Planet Rock-like electro bleeps... [Justin proves that] while no innovator, he is a fine student\". In his review of the album Justified for Rolling Stone, Ben Ratliff wrote \"In Like I Love You, a nasty funk rhythm on loud, live drums shares the space with a tiny guitar strum and Timberlake's breathy, studied tenor; it's minimalism influenced by Michael Jackson. But a softer, harmony-and-hook-filled chorus sets it off, thus pleasing preteen girls and beat junkies alike.\"\nDenise Boyd, writing for BBC Music, said that the song was a \"sure bet for success\" with the Neptunes"

Dean Taylor, Frank Wilson, Pam Sawyer, Deke Richards. \"Love Child\" is a 1968 song released by the Motown label for Diana Ross & the Supremes. The second single and title track from their album Love Child, it became the Supremes' 11th (and penultimate) number-one single in the United States, where it sold 500,000 in its first week and 2 million copies by year's end.\nThe record took just three weeks to reach the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart, which it then topped for two weeks, November 30\u2014December 7, 1968, before being dethroned by an even bigger Motown single, Marvin Gaye's \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\". \"Love Child\" also performed well on the soul chart \u2014 where it spent three weeks at number two (stuck behind Johnnie Taylor's \"Who's Making Love\") \u2014 and paved new ground for a major pop hit with its then-controversial subject matter of illegitimacy. It is also the single that finally knocked the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" off the top spot in the United States after its nine-week run. The Supremes debuted the dynamic and intense song on the season premiere of the CBS variety program The Ed Sullivan Show on Sunday, September 29, 1968. In Billboard's special 2015 chart of the Top 40 Biggest Girl Groups of All Time on the Billboard Hot 100, \"Love Child\" ranked highest among the Supremes' six entries.\n\nIn 1967, Diana Ross & the Supremes dropped Florence Ballard, engaged new member Cindy Birdsong and added Ross' name to the billing. Following this string of changes, the Supremes had mixed success on the pop charts. \"Reflections\" peaked at number 2 on the Billboard pop charts and \"In and out of Love\" peaked at 9, but the group's next two singles did not make the pop top twenty.\nThis prompted Motown label chief Berry Gordy to hold a special meeting in a room at the Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit, which was attended by a team of writers and producers at the label, including R. Dean Taylor, Frank Wilson, Pam Sawyer, Deke Richards, and Henry Cosby.  The group, who named themselves The Clan, set to work on a hit single for Diana Ross & the Supremes. Instead of composing another love-based song, the team decided to craft a tune about a woman who is asking her boyfriend not to pressure her into sleeping with him, for fear they would conceive a \"love child.\" The woman, portrayed on the record by Diana Ross, is herself a love child, and, besides not having a father at home, had to endure wearing rags to school and growing up in an \"old, cold, run-down tenement slum.\" The background vocals echo this sentiment, asking the boyfriend to please \"wait/wait won't you wait now/hold on/wait/just a little bit longer.\"\nAs was nearly always the case on singles released under the \"Diana Ross & the Supremes\" name, Supremes members Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong do not perform on the record; Motown session singers The Andantes performed the background vocals.  All lead vocals were by Diana Ross, who would leave the group in a year for a solo career.\nThe public responded immediately to \"Love Child\" when it was released as a single on September 30, 1968, rising to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming the third biggest selling Supremes' single behind \"Baby Love\" and \"Someday We'll Be Together.\" The feat was repeated in Canada, where it also reached number one in the RPM 100 national singles chart. In the UK singles chart, the song peaked at number 15, and number three in Australia. \"Love Child\" became the title track of Diana Ross & the Supremes' Love Child album, released on November 13, 1968.\n7\" single (30 September 1968) (North America/United Kingdom)\n\"Love Child\" \u2013 2:59\n\"Will This Be the Day\" \u2013 2:50\n7\" single (1968) (Netherlands)\n\"Love Child\" \u2013 2:59\n\"Misery Makes Its Home in My Heart \" \u2013 2:52\nLead vocals by Diana Ross\nBackground vocals by The Andantes: Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow, and Louvain Demps\nInstrumentation by The Funk Brothers and the"

It rose to number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified Platinum in May 2007 by the RIAA. It was listed in the top 10 digital selling songs of 2007, and it was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum for digital sales in 2019.\nThe song was written by Chris Daughtry, Ace Young (who was on American Idol with Daughtry), Gregg Wattenberg, Mark Wilkerson and produced by Howard Benson.\n\nAfter much speculation on when and even if a video would be released, the video was finally released on AOL on January 10, 2007. The video was co-directed by Dean Karr and Jay Martin (Karr directed the performance scenes while Martin did the narrative scenes).\nIt begins with a man, played by Dennis Connolly, lying in bed while he has a flashback of himself gathering his personal effects upon release from prison. His girlfriend, played by Nina Sanchez, picks him up after his release; they hug and hold hands along the way. After a time they stop at a store. While he is inside, she has a flashback to when she first heard the news of his arrest, and we see that she was pregnant at the time. Dennis gets back in the car with a stuffed rabbit. They then arrive at her home, and there is a young girl inside, presumably the couple's daughter. Nina explains something to the girl while he waits outside. Dennis enters and gives the toy to his daughter, whom he has never met before. After a reluctant moment, the two hug.\nThe video cuts back to the couple lying in bed, and they seem to be distant; when he attempts to touch her, she pulls away. Intercut with this scene is Dennis looking for a job, which proves to be unsuccessful. He walks by and enters several stores, none of which are hiring. He passes a jewelry store, and all the recent positive events flash before him: his release, his daughter, and a rosary. He then notices a \"Help Wanted\" sign and inquires inside the garage; he gets the job as a car mechanic. He again passes the jewelry store, and sees brief flashes of the couple making love, his booking photos and a cross; he hides his face so the owner does not recognize him, implying that he was arrested for trying to rob the jewelry store. He is then working in the shop, apparently now employed. One night, as his girlfriend waits for him \u2014 visibly upset \u2014 Dennis is shown entering the jewelry store, looking at first as if he is going to rob it again. When he finally arrives home, Nina opens the door wondering where he's been, Dennis drops to one knee and proposes to her with a wedding ring; Nina is overjoyed, and the video ends with the two embracing.\nIntercut throughout the video are scenes with scenes of the band playing the song in an immaculate looking grand room, it is of the main atrium of the Surrogate's Courthouse in New York City.\n\nMost critics found \"It's Not Over\" to be catchy and a solid first single.  Billboard magazine called \"It's Not Over\" a \"tight, focused and ready to rock your face off\" single that \"overflows with harmonies and axe leads that suck you in out of the box.\"  Entertainment Weekly found the song \"ridiculously catchy\".  Daniel Wolfe of About.com said the band does \"a great job of telling the story of a relationship gone wrong,\" ultimately giving the song three and a half out of five stars.  There has been some talk of the single's similarity to the Fuel song, \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\", which Chris Daughtry performed on American Idol.\nOn December 6, 2007, the song was nominated for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.\nThe single debuted fairly high on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 65 in late November 2006, partly due to the song already reaching the top 40 on iTunes. It went on to become a top five single for the band, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. It has also become a number one single for the band on the Adult Top 40 chart and on the American Top 40 countdown. The main version of the song has sold 2,103,000 copies in the United States as of April 2010, and the combined sales of different versions of the song exceeded three million.\nOn the international scene, the song, along with the album, appeared in the New Zealand RIANZ Singles Chart, the song debuting at number 38 on the Singles Chart, and the album debuting at number 17 on the Albums Chart. The single made the top 10 in New Zealand. The single was to be released in the UK on August 6, 2007, but was deleted at"

It was released on September 25, 2012, as the lead single from her second studio album, Warrior (2012). Kesha co-wrote the song with its producers, Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, and Cirkut, with additional writing from Nate Ruess, the lead singer of Fun. Kesha wrote the lyrics after traveling around the world and embarking on a spiritual journey.\n\"Die Young\" charted in multiple countries, debuting at 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. In its third week, \"Die Young\" broke into the Hot 100's top-ten, making it Kesha's seventh consecutive top-ten hit as a lead artist since her debut on the chart in 2010 with \"Tik Tok\" and ninth top-ten hit overall including her collaborations with 3OH!3, Britney Spears, and Nicki Minaj. It eventually peaked at number two, continuing Kesha's string of top-ten singles. The song has also reached the top ten in multiple countries worldwide, including most of the English-speaking world and has received a Platinum certification in five countries.\nIn December 2012, the song was removed from some radio stations in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.\nProduced primarily by Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco, Kesha worked with the lead singer of fun., Nate Ruess, to write \"Die Young\". Co-producer Blanco called the song \"old hippie rock.\" The song was written in 2011, after Kesha traveled the world. Before working on her second studio album, she went on a spiritual journey. Recalling experiences of feeding baby lions and swimming with great white sharks, Kesha said, \"I got hypnotized, and I just really wanted this record to be really positive, really raw, really vulnerable and about the magic of life.\" She intends for the song to show her vulnerable side, saying, \"I have a lot of growing and evolving to do. I'm definitely not a one-trick pony and I think people are starting to see that more and more.\"\nAbout the song, she told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio:\n\"It's kind of an anthem. It's a celebration song, which I\u2019m obviously known for writing those, but this one, the concept of it was to live each and every single day like it's your last and to always remain having a youthful spirit no matter how old I get...I can sing like a motherf***er! You're going to hear that because I'm also doing this acoustic EP for my fans. Some of the old songs and the new songs.\"\nThe song employs Kesha's trademark electropop sounds. \"Die Young\" spreads acoustic guitar strums, in the progression of C#m-B-E-A, over an uptempo dance beat, while Kesha belts her half-rapped, half-sung vocals on the verses, where she says, \"I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums.\" Over throbbing percussion, she continues: \"Oh what a shame that you came here with someone / So while you're here in my arms / Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young.\" \"Die Young\" features synth riffs in the new wave style, reminiscent of The Cars and other music in the 1980s. Towards the end of the song, a choir of backing vocals chimes the chorus over a glam rock drum beat.\nSeventeen called it \"classic Ke$ha\", while Robbie Daw of Idolator said, \"[I'm] getting a 'if you\u2019ve heard one Ke$ha song, you\u2019ve heard 'em all' vibe, which is unfortunate.\" In an interview with Rolling Stone, she said she intended to craft songs in the 1970s \"cock rock\" genre, but Daw felt that her lackluster vocal delivery neither departed from her previous sound nor lived up to the hype. Rolling Stone said that \"Die Young\" is \"the Ke$ha we know and love,\" and that \"it sounds sorta exactly like Taio Cruz\". August Brown of the Los Angeles Times agreed, saying the single was, \"...no major departure from her classic template of ravey pop spiced with gum-smacking raps and occasional vocal acrobatics.\" Further, she wrote that \"Die Young\" had a \"stock-and-trade\" message, with the title being, \"...a fate... less like a thing to be avoided, and more like the goal is to live fast and leave a good-looking corpse.\" Marc Hogan of Spin wrote that Kesha's usual idiosyncrasies of punk rockers downing shots, transparent in even her worst songs, did not appear on \"Die Young\", announcing that \"this one feels a bit more, well, blah than her previous hits.\""

The song was written by Kerli, Jean Baptiste, Mick McHenry and Ryan Buendia and was produced by Free School Music and Jean Baptiste. It was released on December 16, 2010, via free download on Kerli's official website. It was released for purchase as a single on April 12, 2011. A 9-track remix EP was released on May 3, 2011, and part 2 was released on June 21, 2011.\nThe song charted on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play Songs chart for a total of 11 weeks, and peaked at number 1 for the week of May 7, 2011. \"Army of Love\" was number 12 on the 2011 Billboard Year-End Dance/Club Songs chart.\nKerli announced on November 4, 2010, that the first promotional single from her sophomore album would be titled \"Army of Love\" and that the video had nearly finished production.\n\"Army of Love\" was written by Kerli, Jean Baptiste, Michael McHenry and Ryan Buendia. It was produced by Free School Music and Baptiste. \"Army of Love\" features a very distinct rhythmic electronic beat primarily consisting of an electronic keyboard, synths and a short drum beat. The song samples melody from 3 AM Eternal by the KLF.\nAbout.com Dance Music / Electronica's DJ Ron Slomowicz selected the track as \"Song of the Day\", stating \"Whether blatantly selling out or making a true artistic shift in musical direction, 'Army of Love' is catchy and may just make Kerli more accessible across the board. \"\nThe song debuted at number 51 on the Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart and after eleven weeks, peaked at number 1.\nIt also peaked at number 3 on the \"Raadio Uuno Top 40\" and number 10 on the Estonian Top 40.\nThe music video officially premiered on December 22 on YouTube through Kerli's Vevo channel.\nThe video was filmed over several days in Estonia. It was directed by Kaimar Kukk.\nThe first scene of the video is Kerli sitting a child's bedroom in a rocking chair, playing with a Rubik's Cube. The video cuts to Kerli in an abandoned warehouse where she picks up a phone and announces \"Moonchildren, prepare to take over the universe\". The song then begins with Kerli singing the lyrics into a megaphone as various people (presumably Moonchildren) emerge from different places and march alongside her as she continues singing, thus building the \"army\" mentioned throughout the song. They follow her into a forest, where she finds a unicorn. Several cut-in scenes depict Kerli as an elven princess swinging on a wooden swing, as well as Kerli performing the song on a truck stage for an audience of enthusiastic Moonchildren. The final scene of the video is the Moonchildren marching after Kerli as she rides the unicorn off into the forest, and the video is subsequently concluded by a title screen proclaiming \"To Be Continued...\"\nIn the first half of video, up until the point where the song begins, the words \"integrity\", \"love\", and \"unity\" can be heard whispered by Kerli. Phrases such as \"integrity\", \"love\", \"unity\", \"we're coming\", \"follow me,\" and \"K713\" also blink on and off screen throughout the video.\nAs of January 2015, the music video has 4,607,958 views on YouTube.Review site Idolator said that the song's music video is the \"hottest rave to hit Middle Earth, \" referencing the works of J. R. R.

It was released on December 29, 2007, as the lead single from Meet Miley Cyrus (2007), the second soundtrack album from the Disney Channel original series Hannah Montana and the debut studio album of Cyrus. It was written by Cyrus (credited as Destiny Hope Cyrus) with the song's producers Antonina Armato and Tim James. Later, it was remixed by Rock Mafia as the second single from Cyrus' second studio album, Breakout (2008). Musically, the track is a dance-rock song that contains influences from various musical genres, including electronic music. Lyrically, it speaks of teenage romance. The original version of the song was only released as a single in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The song was released internationally remixed by Rock Mafia.\n\"See You Again\" received acclaim from music critics, with many complimenting its composition and Cyrus' vocals. It was her first commercially successful song; it introduced her to new audiences and new countries, paving the way for future hits. The song went top 10 in the US, Canada, Hungary and Australia. Although a music video for the song was never filmed, it was given a promotional clip for the remix version, taken from a performance at the 2008 Disney Channel Games. The song was promoted through a multitude of live television performances. It was included on the setlist of Cyrus' headlining tours, the Best of Both Worlds Tour (2007\u201308), the Wonder World Tour (2009) and the Gypsy Heart Tour (2011). \"See You Again\" has been covered by various notable artists, including Little Boots and Breathe Carolina.\nWhen Cyrus starred as Miley Stewart, a girl with a secret double life as pop star Hannah Montana, on the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana, she developed fame as a teen idol and released the series' first soundtrack while being credited as Hannah Montana. In late 2006, Cyrus began execution for her debut album. Cyrus' debut studio album Meet Miley Cyrus was attached to the series' second soundtrack, Hannah Montana 2, and released as the second disc of the Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus (2007) double-disc album. \"See You Again\" was written by Cyrus, who was credited as her birth name Destiny Hope Cyrus, Antonina Armato, and Tim James. The writing group has executed numerous songs recorded by Cyrus, contributing to a large part of all three of her studio albums.\nWhen composing tracks for Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive in regards to adding \"See You Again\" to the album. \"I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I want to put it on the album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.\", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says \"See You Again\" is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008). It was released as the second single from Breakout on August 11, 2008.\n\"See You Again\" is a dance-rock song with a length of three minutes and ten seconds. The songs contains numerous influences from electronic, new wave, and techno music. The song is set in the time signature of common time and has a fast tempo of 138 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A minor with Cyrus' vocal range spanning one octave, from the low note of G\u2083 to the high note of A\u2084. Throughout the track, her edgy and sultry vocals maintain in the contralto range. The lyrics of \"See You Again\" are about a teenage romance. In verses, Cyrus discusses her feelings and perceptions about her love interest, such as believing the couple had previously encountered in a previous incarnation. \"See You Again\"'s refrains detail previous scenes of an encounter between the couple: \"The last time I freaked out / I just kept looking down / I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking 'bout.\" Towards the conclusion of the refrains, Cyrus vows to redeem herself.\nChuck Taylor of Billboard felt that, by offering meaningful airplay to \"See You Again\", mainstream radio stations were getting with the program. Taylor described the song as \"a sassy, uptempo stinger that adds appealing youthful buzz to the airwaves\" and complimented Cyrus' vocals with comparisons to Hilary Duff and Avril Lavigne. \"Cyrus [...] at last adds the missing link to TV and movie acclaim. Alas, FM, better late than never\", he concluded."

It was released on a non-album single in March 1968, as the B-side to \"Lady Madonna\". The song was the first Harrison composition to be issued on a Beatles single and reflects the band's embrace of Transcendental Meditation, which they were studying in India under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the time of the single's release. After \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\", it was the last of Harrison's three songs from the Beatles era that demonstrate an overt Indian classical influence and are styled as Indian pieces.

It is the only Beatles studio recording to be made outside Europe and introduced Indian instruments such as sarod, shehnai and pakhavaj to the band's sound. The musicians on the track include Aashish Khan, Hanuman Jadev and Hariprasad Chaurasia. Aside from Harrison's lead vocal, recorded in London, the Beatles' only contribution came in the form of group backing vocals over the song's final line. In the decade following its release, the song became a comparative rarity among the band's recordings; it has subsequently appeared on compilation albums such as Rarities, Past Masters, Volume Two and Mono Masters.\n\"The Inner Light\" has received praise from several music critics and musicologists for its melodic qualities and its evocation of the meditation experience. Jeff Lynne and Anoushka Shankar performed the song at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death. An alternative take of the 1968 instrumental track was released in 2014 on the remastered Wonderwall Music CD. Screenwriter Morgan Gendel named a 1992 episode of the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation as an homage to the song. In 2020, Harrison's Material World Foundation announced The Inner Light Challenge, an initiative to raise funds for the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund, Save the Children and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison recalls that he was inspired to write \"The Inner Light\" by Juan Mascar\u00f3, a Sanskrit scholar at Cambridge University. Mascar\u00f3 had taken part in a debate, televised on The Frost Programme on 4 October 1967, during which Harrison and John Lennon discussed the merits of Transcendental Meditation with an audience of academics and religious leaders. In a subsequent letter to Harrison, dated 16 November, Mascar\u00f3 expressed the hope that they might meet again before the Beatles departed for India, where the group were to study meditation with their guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Mascar\u00f3 enclosed a copy of his book Lamps of Fire, an anthology of religious writings, including from Lao-Tzu's Tao Te Ching. Having stated his admiration for the spiritual message in Harrison's composition \"Within You Without You\", Mascar\u00f3 enquired: \"might it not be interesting to put into your music a few words of Tao, for example no. 48, page 66 of Lamps?\"\nHarrison wrote the song during a period when he had undertaken his first musical project outside the Beatles, composing the soundtrack to the Joe Massot-directed film Wonderwall, and continued to study the Indian sitar, partly under the tutelage of Ravi Shankar. When writing \"The Inner Light\", he made minimal alterations to the translated Lao-Tzu text and used the same title that Mascar\u00f3 had used. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison says of the changes required to create his second verse:\nIn the original poem, the verse says \"Without going out of my door, I can know the ways of heaven.\" And so to prevent any misinterpretations \u2013 and also to make the song a bit longer \u2013 I did repeat that as a second verse but made it: \"Without going out of your door / You can know all things on earth / Without looking out of your window / You can know the ways of heaven\" \u2013 so that it included everybody.\nAfter \"Within You Without You\", \"The Inner Light\" was the second composition to fully reflect Harrison's immersion in Eastern spiritual concepts, particularly meditation, an interest"

It first appeared as a digital track on Cyrus' second EP She Is Coming on May 31, 2019, then it was released to radio in early June by RCA Records, as the lead single from the album. It was written by Cyrus, Alma Miettinen, and its producer Andrew Wyatt. The Wuki remix debuted in August, and received a nomination for Best Remixed Recording at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. Its music video won two MTV Video Music Awards in 2020.\n\"Mother's Daughter\" is 3 minutes and 39 seconds long. It was written by Cyrus, Alma Miettinen and its producer Andrew Wyatt. Lyrically, the song was described as a women's empowerment anthem. It focuses on the mother-daughter duo's strong relationship, and references how the singer's mother, Tish Cyrus, told her she'd \"make it\", singing: \"I put my back into it, my heart in it/So I did it, yeah I did it.\". Additionally, Cyrus describes herself as \"nasty and evil\", and explains that she has the freedom to do as she wishes: \"Don't fuck with my freedom/I came up to get me some/I'm nasty, I'm evil/Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter\", she sings in the chorus.\nFollowing the release of She Is Coming, \"Mother's Daughter\" debuted at number 54 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It is Cyrus' 47th entry on the chart, and her highest debut since \"Adore You\" entered at number 42 following the release of Bangerz in 2013.\nThe official music video was released on July 2, 2019. Alexandre Moors\u2014who has helmed videos for Kendrick Lamar, Jennifer Lopez, ScHoolboy Q and Miguel, as well as the Jennifer Aniston-Alden Ehrenreich war drama The Yellow Birds\u2014directed it. He and Cyrus finalized the concept as the anti-abortion \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d gained traction across the country.\nThe video is about the woman\u2019s body\u2014the right to own your own body and make it free from the male gaze, in any way shape and form, [...] It\u2019s a broad message, and we\u2019re not trying to be dogmatic. But we\u2019re living in difficult times in America, and what I get from this video is that it injects a lot of energy and determination and the right fuel for the struggle.\n\u2014\u2009director Alexandre Moors talking about the music video to Los Angeles Times\nIt features Cyrus wearing a red latex catsuit against red lighting and aesthetics, and features shots of diverse women, including body positivity women, women of color, disabled women, transgender women, and a non-binary person using they/them pronouns, sitting and posing in different places. Cyrus' real-life mother Tish Cyrus makes a cameo appearance in the video. The video also shows nude scenes and has feminist signs flashing on-screen at random intervals. It is also sprinkled with images of breastfeeding, C-sections, menstruation pads\u2014everything about the female body that's supposed to carry some taboo. The video is presented in 4:3 aspect ratio format.\nCyrus' red latex catsuit, calls back to the memorable outfits worn in Britney Spears' \"Oops!...I Did It Again\" and Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" videos. Her version, however, has a bejeweled vagina dentata, as a notable embellishment. She also appears wearing a gold armor while atop a horse, holding a sword \u00e0 la Joan of Arc. That latex look, otherwise, was not meant to be an explicit callback to the aforementioned musicians, but rather, \"it was interesting to subvert some of the codes of the sexual attire, and actually transform beyond it into more of an armor or a fight suit\" Moors said, \"They look more like warriors than anything with sexual implications.\"\nIn coordination with the video drop, Cyrus shared 18 posts on her Instagram account that featured statements from those who make cameos.\nThe Insider placed the music video second on their list of the best music videos of 2019, commenting that \"aside from the genius styling and gorgeous direction, the real triumph of Cyrus' video is how it highlights a wide variety of people who might connect with the song's message of empowerment and freedom\".\nCyrus first performed \"Mother's Daughter\", along with \"Cattitude\" and \"D.R.E.A.M.\", at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Middlesbrough on May 25, 2019. It was also performed at Primavera Sound in Barcelona on May 31, Orange Warsaw Festival in Warsaw on June 1, Tinderbox in Odense on June 28, and at Glastonbury Festival in Pilton on June 30. Later Cyrus performed song on iHeartRadio Music Festival 2019 in Las Vegas.\nOn October 22, 2020 the Constitutional Tribunal of Poland ruled that an abortion in cases of \"disability or"

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Written by lead guitarist George Harrison, it was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after \"Love You To\", and was inspired by his stay in India in late 1966 with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar. Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, tambura, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle. The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.\nThe song was Harrison's only composition on Sgt. Pepper, although his endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover. With the worldwide success of the album, \"Within You Without You\" presented Indian classical music to a new audience in the West and contributed to the genre's peak in international popularity. It also influenced the philosophical direction of many of Harrison's peers during an era of utopian idealism marked by the Summer of Love. The song has traditionally received a varied response from music critics, some of whom find it lacklustre and pretentious, while others admire its musical authenticity and consider the message to be the most meaningful on Sgt. Pepper. Writing for Rolling Stone, David Fricke described the track as being \"at once beautiful and severe, a magnetic sermon about materialism and communal responsibility in the middle of a record devoted to gentle Technicolor anarchy\".\nFor the Beatles' 2006 remix album Love, the song was mixed with the John Lennon-written \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", creating what some reviewers consider to be that project's most successful mashup. Sonic Youth, Rainer Ptacek, Oasis, Patti Smith, Cheap Trick and the Flaming Lips are among the artists who have covered \"Within You Without You\".\nGeorge Harrison began writing \"Within You Without You\" in early 1967 while at the house of musician and artist Klaus Voormann, in the north London suburb of Hampstead. Harrison's immediate inspiration for the song came from a conversation they had shared over dinner about the metaphysical space that prevents individuals from recognising the natural forces uniting the world. Following this discussion, Harrison worked out the song's melody on a harmonium and came up with the opening line: \"We were talking about the space between us all\".\nThe song was Harrison's second composition to be explicitly influenced by Indian classical music, after \"Love You To\", which featured Indian instruments such as sitar, tabla and tambura. Since recording the latter track for the Beatles' Revolver in April 1966, Harrison had continued to look outside his role as the band's lead guitarist, further immersing himself in studying the sitar, partly under the tutelage of master sitarist Ravi Shankar. Harrison said that the tune for \"Within You Without You\" came about through his regularly performing musical exercises known as sargam, which use the same scales as those found in Indian ragas.\n\"Within You Without You\" is the first of Harrison's many songs to include Hindu spiritual concepts in his lyrics. Having incorporated elements of Eastern philosophy in \"Love You To\", Harrison became fascinated by ancient Hindu teachings after he and his wife, Pattie Boyd, visited Shankar in India in September\u2013October 1966. Intent on mastering the sitar, Harrison first joined other students of Shankar's in Bombay, until local fans and the press learned of his arrival. Harrison, Boyd, Shankar and the latter's partner, Kamala Chakravarty, then relocated to a houseboat on Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir. There, Harrison received personal tuition from Shankar while absorbing religious texts such as Paramahansa Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi and Swami Vivekananda's Raja Yoga. This period coincided with his introduction to meditation and, during their visit to Vrindavan, he witnessed communal chanting for the first time.\nHarrison and Boyd returned to England on 22 October, and continued to adhere to a Hindu-aligned lifestyle of yoga, meditation and vegetarianism at their home in Esher.

It was released on 13 September 1997 as a tribute single to Diana, Princess of Wales, with the global proceeds from the song going towards Diana's charities. In many countries, it was pressed as a double A-side with \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\". It was produced by Sir George Martin.\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" is the second highest-selling physical single of all time (behind Bing Crosby's \"White Christmas\" from 1942), and is the highest-selling single since charts began in the 1950s.\nAfter being released, \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" entered at number one in the UK Singles Chart, John's fourth UK number-one single, and became the best-selling single in UK chart history. In October it became John's ninth US number-one single, where it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks, and is the best-selling single in Billboard history; it was the first single certified Diamond in the US. The song also topped the German Singles Chart for seven weeks, the Australian Singles Chart for six weeks, and many other music charts around the world.\nThe 1997 version won John the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 40th Grammy Awards ceremony in 1998. At the 1998 Brit Awards the song was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Single. The lyrics of the earlier version of \"Candle in the Wind\", also written by Taupin, were a tribute to Marilyn Monroe. The opening lines of the 1973 version, \"Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all,\" were adapted to \"Goodbye England's rose, may you ever grow in our hearts.\" Most of the lyrics were adapted to suit the circumstances of Diana's life and death.\nOn 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, died in a car crash in Paris, France. The news shocked John, as he and the Princess were very good friends. A month earlier, he had also lost another good friend, fashion designer Gianni Versace. Pictures depicting Diana appearing to console a distraught John at Versace's funeral were featured prominently in news coverage throughout the world.\nTo cope with the grief, John wanted to pay a tribute to Diana. In his autobiography, Me, John says he had a phone call from Richard Branson who said that many of those writing in the Book of Condolence at St James Palace were quoting the lyrics of \"Candle in the Wind\". Branson asked John if he would rewrite the lyrics and sing them at the funeral. John believed that Branson had been contacted by the Spencer family. John contacted his songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, asking him to revise the lyrics of their 1973 song \"Candle in the Wind\" to honour her. George Martin was contacted to help produce the song, and added a string quartet (Peter Manning, Keith Pascoe, Levine Andrade, and Andrew Shulman), and woodwind (Pippa Davies, flute and oboe) to help balance the recording. It was recorded at Townhouse Studios in West London, immediately following the funeral.\nJohn publicly performed \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" only once, at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Westminster Abbey on 6 September 1997. He continues to sing the original version of the song at his concerts but has repeatedly turned down requests to perform the revised version, even for the memorial Concert for Diana in July 2007, having vowed never to perform it again unless asked by Diana's sons. The song has never been released (or re-released) on any of his other albums or compilations, not even his 1997 album The Big Picture, nor the 1997 Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute album (an official 2-CD release sanctioned by Diana's family that included other artists such as Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Queen, Celine Dion, and Rod Stewart). The song was included on Diana, Princess of Wales: The BBC Recording of the Funeral Service. The soundtrack was released on 30 September 1997.\n\"Candle in the Wind 1997\" became the fastest-selling single in the UK, selling 658,000 copies on its first day of release and over 1.5"

Composed by Elton John, with lyrics by Tim Rice, the song was performed by Carmen Twillie (the deep female lead vocals) and Lebo M. (opening vocals in Zulu) as the film's opening song. In an interview, Rice said he was amazed at the speed with which John composed: \"I gave him the lyrics at the beginning of the session at about two in the afternoon. By half-past three, he'd finished writing and recording a stunning demo.\" Elton John sang a pop version (with alternative lyrics) of the song with the London Community Gospel Choir, which was included in the film's soundtrack and made into a music video.\n\"Circle of Life\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1994, along with two other songs from The Lion King: \"Hakuna Matata\" and \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\", the latter of which won the award. \"Circle of Life\" was also nominated for a Song of the Year Grammy. The song reached No. 11 in the UK and No. 18 in the US and is featured frequently in attractions based on The Lion King, such as Disney theme parks and parades. Michael Crawford sang it as part of a medley for The Disney Album in 2001.\nThe song was featured in Disney's 2019 photorealistic computer-animated remake of The Lion King and was used in the first trailer of the film, a near shot-for-shot remake of the opening of the original animated film. This new version of the song was performed by Brown Lindiwe Mkhize, the actress who performed as Rafiki in the stage adaptation of the movie in London from 2005 to 2018. However, the new version also retains the original Zulu opening vocals by Lebo M. from the 1994 film.\n\nIn the theatrical adaptation, the opening sequence is noticeably different from the opening of the film. For example, the song is sung by Rafiki instead of an off-screen female narrator.\nWith the sun rising over the Pride Lands, Rafiki commences the start of the production by singing the opening chant of the song and summoning the animals of the Pride Lands for the presentation of baby Simba. As the first two verses of the musical number end, a representation of Pride Rock appears on stage carrying its two reigning rulers, Sarabi cradling the small puppet representing her son in her arms with Mufasa alongside her. As the choir chants excitedly in the background, Rafiki accompanies the monarch and his consort to the top of Pride Rock to bless the cub before raising him high in the air, singing joyfully alongside the chorus as the gathered animals bow before their new prince.\nAt the end of Act II, Simba's friends and family acknowledge him as the rightful king after Scar's defeat. Rafiki crowns Simba with the mantle of kingship after his victory and Simba ascends Pride Rock. There he gives a mighty roar which echoes across the whole kingdom, and the animals come back to the Pride Lands to recognise and salute Simba as the rightful king. The musical ends as Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to all of the animals, followed by a blackout that finishes Act II and leads to the curtain call at the end of the performance.\nThe assembly of animals that appear are slightly different from the beginning of Act I. There are no wildebeests or adult elephant, only two zebras instead of three, nine gazelles instead of twelve, and half of the bird performers instead of four. Only the baby elephant, the rhino, the giraffes, three cranes, the cheetah, and the birds appear as poles on cranes as kites.\nThe song was re-recorded in 2003 by the Disney Channel Circle of Stars, a group of actors and actresses who have appeared in Disney Channel television series and original movies, for the album Disneymania 2.  The line-up was significantly different when their next rerecording, \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\", was released two years later.\nIn 2017 American boyband"

It was the fifth release from the album overall. The song tells the story of a woman taking revenge on her potentially unfaithful boyfriend/husband.\nThe song became an enormous crossover success, topping the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for five consecutive weeks, reaching the top five on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart, and becoming a top ten hit on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart, \"Before He Cheats\" reached number eight and achieved a longevity of 64 consecutive weeks on the chart, making it the eighth longest-charting single in the history of the Hot 100 chart.\n\"Before He Cheats\" became the first ever country song to sell over two million digitally and was once the best-selling country song of all time. It had sold 4,483,000 digital downloads as of January 2020, and was once the best-selling song by an American Idol contestant but is now the third best-selling (behind Phillip Phillips' \"Home\" and Kelly Clarkson's \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\"). It has also been certified 6\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA, Underwood's largest-selling single to date.\nThe song has received a number of accolades. At the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, Underwood won the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and the song's writers won the Grammy Award for Best Country Song. It received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Song of the Year as well. It was also named the 2007 Single of the Year by the Country Music Association Awards. It ranked on CMT's 40 Greatest Songs of the Decade at number 25, along with Underwood's other signature hit, \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\", which ranked number four.\n\"Before He Cheats\" tells the story of a woman taking revenge on her potentially unfaithful boyfriend or husband.\nShe imagines him hanging out and flirting with a \"bleach-blonde\" girl, shooting pool, buying her a drink, dancing, and hoping to \"get lucky\" with her. In retaliation, she vandalizes his customized four-wheel drive vehicle by keying the sides, carving her name into its leather seats, smashing the headlights with a Louisville Slugger baseball bat and slashing all four tires. All of these actions are part of her hopes that this will make him \"think before he cheats\" again.\nAlthough the song is about a tale of revenge, according to Carrie Underwood, while she had been cheated on before, \"I wouldn't recommend doing any property damage, though. I'm a 'let it go, move on' kind of person.\"\n\"Before He Cheats\" is set in the key of F-sharp minor. It has a moderate tempo in cut time with a \"shuffle\" beat. The song's main chord pattern is F\u266fm-E-D\u209b\u1d64\u209b2-C\u266fm, and Underwood's vocals range from F\u266f3-C\u266f5.\nThe music video for \"Before He Cheats\" was directed by Roman White. In the beginning of the video Underwood is seen leaving a parking lot brandishing a Louisville Slugger, having just vandalized her husband/boyfriend's truck for cheating on her. In other scenes, the \"husband/boyfriend\" (portrayed by actor Tabb Shoup) is seen kissing another woman. As the video progresses Underwood takes the stage to sing as various objects behind her, such as lamps, are seen exploding. At one point, a screen shot of the front seat of the truck is seen with Underwood's name carved in it, which she mentions during the chorus of the song. Eventually, she catches up with her cheating husband/boyfriend with the other woman. After looking shocked for a second, she scoffs and drops the keys to his now-demolished truck into his drink. Towards the end Underwood struts down a street, singing along with the song, while different objects are shown flying across the air, glasses are seen shattering, and light bulbs explode, paying homage to Brian De Palma's Carrie. At the very end of the music video, the truck is shown completely destroyed.\nThe early scenes in the video featuring a crowd in a narrow street and Underwood in a parking garage, were filmed in and around Printer's Alley in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The final scene, featuring the exploding glass and light bulbs, was filmed on Fourth Avenue just north of Church Street in Nashville.\n\"Before He Cheats\" made GAC music video history by debuting at number one. It also marks the third consecutive number-one music video on GAC for Underwood. It made history on CMT's Top Twenty Countdown for being at number"

The song was released by RCA Records on June 5, 2012 as the third and final single from Clarkson's fifth studio album, Stronger (2011). \"Dark Side\" is a mid-tempo synth-pop ballad that incorporates a vigorous music box melody with up-tempo beats in choruses, with its lyrics containing the theme of acceptance, recovery, and inner-beauty.\n\"Dark Side\" has received generally positive reviews from music critics who considered the song as a good successor to \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\", Clarkson's previous single. Critics also praised Clarkson's vocal performance blending with the song's melody. It became her second consecutive song to top the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Shane Drake, who also directed \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" and premiered on May 24, 2012 with positive reviews. It was nominated for a MTV Video Music Award for Best Video with a Message at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. Clarkson has performed \"Dark Side\" during several live appearances, most notably during the 2012 Billboard Music Awards and included the song as the opening performance in the set list during the North American leg of her Stronger Tour.\n\"Dark Side\" was written by songwriters busbee & Alexander Geringas, and produced by Greg Kurstin. In an interview with Popjustice, Clarkson revealed that she had always desired to collaborate with Kurstin since finishing recording tracks for her sophomore album Breakaway in 2004. Jeff Aldrich, RCA Records' A&R executive, managed to get Kurstin to produce tracks for Clarkson's fifth studio album in 2010. Kursin took time to hear Clarkson's previous records before their recording sessions began, in which Clarkson felt made the recording \"easier.\"\nIn July 2011, several of Clarkson's demos were leaked on the internet, including a demo of \"Dark Side\". The final version of the song then surfaced online a week prior to the album's release, although it was quickly removed by RCA Records and the IFPI. Clarkson subsequently published the song online to prevent the leaks. In an interview with New York radio Z100, Clarkson revealed that she was considering \"Dark Side\" to be released as the third single from Stronger: \"I like \"Dark Side\" because it\u2019s still got a beat to it, It\u2019s a sweet-sounding song but with a dark lyric, and I like that.\" During the Canadian leg of her Stronger Tour, Clarkson confirmed to MTV News Canada that \"Dark Side\" will be released as the third single from the album. The song was already receiving early radio airplay in Sydney, Australia from November 2011, on the pop/rock show, 'Juice'.\n\"Dark Side\" is a midtempo synth-pop ballad. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com, \"Dark Side\" is written in the key of D major with a moderate tempo of 119 beats per minute.  It follows a chord progression of D-D\u2212G\u2212Em7b5/G, and Kelly's vocals span from D\u2084 to F\u266f\u2085.\nChris Willman of The Wrap remarked, \"\"Dark Side\" cleverly reinforces the idea that Miss American Idol has a shadow side with a spooky music-box melody that cuts in every time the big beat and goth histrionics briefly cut out.\" James Dinh of MTV News described the song as \"On \"Dark Side,\" Kelly ventures away from her sometimes predictable scorned woman stomping grounds and closer toward her vulnerable side as she questions whether her lover will stick around even through the bad times.\" Entertainment Weekly also included the song in their \"Songs for the Lovers (and Haters)\" playlist article, remarking, \"(Clarkson's) soaring synth-pop ballad defines what love's all about: knowing your girlfriend's a little bit crazy, and still not running away.\"\nJoey Guerra of Houston Chronicle noted that \"Dark Side recalls Clarkson's under-appreciated My December disc, a swirl of lullaby strains and goth-pop grooves. Think Katy Perry with a much, much better voice.\" Jason Scott of Seattle Post-Intelligencer remarked, \"\"Dark Side,\" takes Stronger and banks a hard left. With a xylophone tinkling out a lullaby-like intro, Clarkson takes a creative adventure into extraterrestrial territory that is an oddly soothing and intriguing fit for her voice.

It was the fifth release from the album overall. The song tells the story of a woman taking revenge on her potentially unfaithful boyfriend/husband.\nThe song became an enormous crossover success, topping the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for five consecutive weeks, reaching the top five on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart, and becoming a top ten hit on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart, \"Before He Cheats\" reached number eight and achieved a longevity of 64 consecutive weeks on the chart, making it the eighth longest-charting single in the history of the Hot 100 chart.\n\"Before He Cheats\" became the first ever country song to sell over two million digitally and was once the best-selling country song of all time. It had sold 4,483,000 digital downloads as of January 2020, and was once the best-selling song by an American Idol contestant but is now the third best-selling (behind Phillip Phillips' \"Home\" and Kelly Clarkson's \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\"). It has also been certified 6\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA, Underwood's largest-selling single to date.\nThe song has received a number of accolades. At the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, Underwood won the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and the song's writers won the Grammy Award for Best Country Song. It received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Song of the Year as well. It was also named the 2007 Single of the Year by the Country Music Association Awards. It ranked on CMT's 40 Greatest Songs of the Decade at number 25, along with Underwood's other signature hit, \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\", which ranked number four.\n\"Before He Cheats\" tells the story of a woman taking revenge on her potentially unfaithful boyfriend or husband.\nShe imagines him hanging out and flirting with a \"bleach-blonde\" girl, shooting pool, buying her a drink, dancing, and hoping to \"get lucky\" with her. In retaliation, she vandalizes his customized four-wheel drive vehicle by keying the sides, carving her name into its leather seats, smashing the headlights with a Louisville Slugger baseball bat and slashing all four tires. All of these actions are part of her hopes that this will make him \"think before he cheats\" again.\nAlthough the song is about a tale of revenge, according to Carrie Underwood, while she had been cheated on before, \"I wouldn't recommend doing any property damage, though. I'm a 'let it go, move on' kind of person.\"\n\"Before He Cheats\" is set in the key of F-sharp minor. It has a moderate tempo in cut time with a \"shuffle\" beat. The song's main chord pattern is F\u266fm-E-D\u209b\u1d64\u209b2-C\u266fm, and Underwood's vocals range from F\u266f3-C\u266f5.\nThe music video for \"Before He Cheats\" was directed by Roman White. In the beginning of the video Underwood is seen leaving a parking lot brandishing a Louisville Slugger, having just vandalized her husband/boyfriend's truck for cheating on her. In other scenes, the \"husband/boyfriend\" (portrayed by actor Tabb Shoup) is seen kissing another woman. As the video progresses Underwood takes the stage to sing as various objects behind her, such as lamps, are seen exploding. At one point, a screen shot of the front seat of the truck is seen with Underwood's name carved in it, which she mentions during the chorus of the song. Eventually, she catches up with her cheating husband/boyfriend with the other woman. After looking shocked for a second, she scoffs and drops the keys to his now-demolished truck into his drink. Towards the end Underwood struts down a street, singing along with the song, while different objects are shown flying across the air, glasses are seen shattering, and light bulbs explode, paying homage to Brian De Palma's Carrie. At the very end of the music video, the truck is shown completely destroyed.\nThe early scenes in the video featuring a crowd in a narrow street and Underwood in a parking garage, were filmed in and around Printer's Alley in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The final scene, featuring the exploding glass and light bulbs, was filmed on Fourth Avenue just north of Church Street in Nashville.\n\"Before He Cheats\" made GAC music video history by debuting at number one. It also marks the third consecutive number-one music video on GAC for Underwood. It made history on CMT's Top Twenty Countdown for being at number"

It is the third single from Underwood's second studio album, Carnival Ride. It was released in the United States on April 7, 2008, by which point the song had already charted. At the 51st Grammy Awards, the song won Underwood her third consecutive Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. It has sold 1,300,000 copies to date.\nThe song is one of four tracks on the album co-written by Underwood, and the third consecutive one to be released as a single from the album.\nThe song is a moderate up-tempo describing a woman meeting a man at a club and later eloping with him in Las Vegas after having had too much to drink that night. She wakes up the next morning, \"thinkin' 'bout Elvis somewhere in Vegas\", to discover that she does not even know her last name (i.e., she married the man while she was intoxicated), and worries that her \"mama would be so ashamed.\" The music video portrays the song as a prequel to her \"Before He Cheats\" song, even going so far as to hire the same actor to play the man in question.\nThe single was generally met with mixed reviews.\nAllmusic picked the song as a \"track pick\", calling the song \"Miranda Lambert filtered through Shania Twain\", and dubbed it a \"one night stand anthem.\" Rolling Stone picked the track as their favorite, saying \"the most fun is \"Last Name,\" where she gets wasted and runs off to Vegas with a guy she doesn't know.\" Blender awarded the song four out of five stars, describing the song as the \"most irresponsible (and fun) moment on the new album involves one wild night, one too many shots of Cuervo and one unexpected ring.\" Billboard gave a positive review of the track, praising the lyrics: \"It's a cleverly penned lyric that hilariously celebrates drunken debauchery\" as well as summing it up as \"a performance that combines soulful vocals, edgy intensity and sassy attitude into a delicious cocktail.\"\nHowever, it also received some negative reviews: Engine 145 gave the song a 'thumbs down', describing the song as a \"straight-laced performance\" that just \"places the focus on the vocal\". Slant Magazine labelled the single as a \"bald-faced attempt at recreating the 'Before He Cheats' phenomenon\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwood performed the song live for the first time on television during the 43rd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards on May 18, 2008. She performed the song live at the seventh season finale of American Idol on May 21, 2008. She performed the song at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009.\nThe song is described in the video as what happened before the \"Before He Cheats\" video.\nThe video starts with some segments from \"Before He Cheats\" and then goes into a scene three months earlier (\"before he cheated\", it says) with her in the club drinking with her friends. The same man from the \"Before He Cheats\" spots her and asks her for a dance. From this point on, while the guy is with Underwood, he is flirting with every other woman he sees. After the dance, Underwood leaves with the guy in his car with fuzzy dice in the rear view mirror. They make it out to Las Vegas where they participate in a couple of gambling activities such as roulette and a Wheel of Fortune game where they win a new truck. Later they get married in a chapel with an Elvis impersonator officiating. They run off in his new pickup truck (the one used in \"Before He Cheats\") and the video ends with a spark from the chapel sign lights.\nThe song debuted at number 46 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, nearly a month before the single's official release. For the week of June 21, 2008 it rose from number five to number one, to become her fifth straight number one on the Billboard chart, her seventh straight number one country single, and her eighth number one Billboard single overall. This marked Underwood as the first solo female artist to have five consecutive number one's on the country survey in almost 20 years, since Rosanne Cash had a string of six number one titles between 1987 and 1989. It is the third country number one from Carnival Ride and reached the top of the chart faster than the first two singles, taking only 13 weeks. \"Last Name\" has sold 1,300,000 downloads as of November 2015.\nOn the Hot 100 the song reached number 19, making it Underwood's fifth top 20 Hot 100 hit, and the second from Carnival Ride.\n\n\n\nKristin Chenoweth performed a cover of the song"

The single had an official release day of November 4, 2019. The song was written by Underwood, co-producer David Garcia and Brett James.\nWritten by Underwood, co-producer David Garcia, and Brett James, the song centers around a bar encounter between a woman and a man after each of their respective relationships have just ended. Because the song was written from the first person narrative, Underwood was adamant that the characters in the song not have a one-night stand, and instead drink at the bar. \"It was important to me because we're singing this [in the] first person\", Underwood said of the song. She explained, \"I didn't want it to be like, 'Oh, we're going to get drunk and go home together', because that's not something that I would do.\"\n\"Drinking Alone\" was met with mostly positive reviews. Taste of Country reviewed the song favorably, saying, \"Underwood's new single brings with it a subtle maturity that's important for her music moving forward. This fourth single from her Cry Pretty album is her most believable, relatable tableau to date.\" They concluded the review by saying, \"the Underwood, Brett James and David Garcia lyric isn't a bop, so it shouldn't sound like one. It's an arrangement as dynamic as the song and both stretch her creatively further than any single radio release has, since she introduced herself on television in 2005.\"\nUpon their review of the album, Consequence of Sound noted \"Drinking Alone\" as the best song on the album, saying \"her voice carries pain, longing, and self-disgust,\" and mentioned it alongside \"Love Wins\" and \"The Bullet\" as the essential tracks on the album.\nIn the United States, \"Drinking Alone\" debuted at number 50 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart and number 49 on the Hot Country Songs chart for the week ending November 16, 2019. It peaked at number 11 and number 17 on each chart respectively, becoming only the second single of her career to miss the top ten on both charts, with the other being \"Love Wins\", the album's second single. On the Billboard Hot 100, it peaked at number 74.\nAs of July 2020, \"Drinking Alone\" is certified Gold by the RIAA.\nThe official music video for the single was released November 20, 2019. The video was directed by Randee St. Nicholas. The actor in the video is Jared Koronkiewicz. Underwood won two CMT Music Awards for the video in October 2020.\nThe song was performed by Underwood on her Cry Pretty Tour 360. Underwood gave the debut televised performance of the song at the 53rd Annual Country Music Association Awards in Nashville. She gave an acoustic performance of the song from her home for the television special ACM Presents: Our Country. In April 2020, she gave another acoustic performance of the song for Sirius XM The Highway's \"Stagecouch Weekend,\" on account of Stagecoach Festival being postponed to October.\nThe album version of the song is four minutes, twenty seconds, while the single version of the song (sent to radio) is three minutes, fifty seconds, with much of the intro and outro of the album version cut. The album version is used for the song's music video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Listen to Carrie Underwood's Slow-Jammin' New Single, \"Drinking Alone\"\". Nash Country Daily.

It received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Song of the Year as well. It was also named the 2007 Single of the Year by the Country Music Association Awards. It ranked on CMT's 40 Greatest Songs of the Decade at number 25, along with Underwood's other signature hit, \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\", which ranked number four.\n\"Before He Cheats\" tells the story of a woman taking revenge on her potentially unfaithful boyfriend or husband.\nShe imagines him hanging out and flirting with a \"bleach-blonde\" girl, shooting pool, buying her a drink, dancing, and hoping to \"get lucky\" with her. In retaliation, she vandalizes his customized four-wheel drive vehicle by keying the sides, carving her name into its leather seats, smashing the headlights with a Louisville Slugger baseball bat and slashing all four tires. All of these actions are part of her hopes that this will make him \"think before he cheats\" again.\nAlthough the song is about a tale of revenge, according to Carrie Underwood, while she had been cheated on before, \"I wouldn't recommend doing any property damage, though. I'm a 'let it go, move on' kind of person.\"\n\"Before He Cheats\" is set in the key of F-sharp minor. It has a moderate tempo in cut time with a \"shuffle\" beat. The song's main chord pattern is F\u266fm-E-D\u209b\u1d64\u209b2-C\u266fm, and Underwood's vocals range from F\u266f3-C\u266f5.\nThe music video for \"Before He Cheats\" was directed by Roman White. In the beginning of the video Underwood is seen leaving a parking lot brandishing a Louisville Slugger, having just vandalized her husband/boyfriend's truck for cheating on her. In other scenes, the \"husband/boyfriend\" (portrayed by actor Tabb Shoup) is seen kissing another woman. As the video progresses Underwood takes the stage to sing as various objects behind her, such as lamps, are seen exploding. At one point, a screen shot of the front seat of the truck is seen with Underwood's name carved in it, which she mentions during the chorus of the song. Eventually, she catches up with her cheating husband/boyfriend with the other woman. After looking shocked for a second, she scoffs and drops the keys to his now-demolished truck into his drink. Towards the end Underwood struts down a street, singing along with the song, while different objects are shown flying across the air, glasses are seen shattering, and light bulbs explode, paying homage to Brian De Palma's Carrie. At the very end of the music video, the truck is shown completely destroyed.\nThe early scenes in the video featuring a crowd in a narrow street and Underwood in a parking garage, were filmed in and around Printer's Alley in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The final scene, featuring the exploding glass and light bulbs, was filmed on Fourth Avenue just north of Church Street in Nashville.\n\"Before He Cheats\" made GAC music video history by debuting at number one. It also marks the third consecutive number-one music video on GAC for Underwood. It made history on CMT's Top Twenty Countdown for being at number"

It was written by Tinashe, Bebe Rexha, Stargate, and Cashmere Cat, and produced by the latter two. A crunk&B song, \"All Hands on Deck\" contains a prominent pan flute breakdown, a thick bassline and \"club-friendly\" beat, and has been described as the \"sister song\" to the album's lead single \"2 On\" (2014). The track's lyrical content comprises a dance instructional and portrays a scenario of retaining confidence, and rebound dating after a break-up, and contain themes of girl power and self empowerment. On February 22, 2015, a remix version of the song premiered online featuring Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, and received a digital-only release on February 24. Serving as the third single from Aquarius, it impacted urban contemporary radio and was released as a digital download in the United States on February 24, 2015.\nThe song garnered positive reviews from music critics who commended its club appeal and Tinashe's vocals, while also naming it as a highlight on the album. Azalea's verse on the promotional remix version was also well-received, with critics opining that her addition was beneficial for the track's airplay prospects. Tinashe has performed \"All Hands on Deck\" for radio stations KPWR and Nova 106.9, and as part of her set list for her Aquarius Tour (2014\u201315).\n\"All Hands on Deck\" was written by Tinashe, Bebe Rexha, Stargate and Cashmere Cat, and produced by the latter two. Stargate and Cashmere Cat were also responsible for the track's instrumentation and programming, while the former recorded the song with Tinashe at DownTown Studios in New York City. \"All Hands on Deck\" was then mixed by Phil Tan at the Ninja Club in Atlanta, Georgia, and mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace, New York City. Other personnel involved included Tim Blacksmith and Danny D. as executive producers, and Daniela Rivera as an assistant engineer. The song's title was first revealed in the announcement of the Aquarius track listing on August 27, 2014. Tinashe then uploaded the original version of \"All Hands on Deck\" to her SoundCloud page along with the rest of the album on September 30, 2014. Rexha announced the song's single release on January 23, 2015, on Snapchat. On February 9, 2015, Tinashe announced that the single's release will be accompanied by a new version of the song which will contain a new verse from a guest feature. In an interview with WZMX, she stated, \"I wanted to put out something that's a little fresh, because the song has been on the album for a few months, so I wanted to give somebody a brand new verse, a little something-something\".\nOn February 21, 2015, Tinashe posted the single's cover art on her Instagram account. A remix version of \"All Hands on Deck\" was premiered by Perez Hilton on February 22, 2015, featuring Australian rapper Iggy Azalea rapping the song's new verse. The official remix was released as a promotional single for The Great Escape Tour, that both Azalea and Tinashe were scheduled to be a part of during the Spring 2015. It received its radio premiere on WZMX on February 23, 2015. Serving as the third single from Aquarius, it impacted urban contemporary radio and was released as a digital download in the United States on February 24, 2015. \"All Hands on Deck\" was commercially released in the United Kingdom on April 19, 2015. Another remix featuring DeJ Loaf was released on June 8, 2015.\n\"All Hands on Deck\" is a crunk&B song which contains elements of West Coast hip hop, grime and late 1990s-early 2000s R&B. It comprises a thick bassline, \"club-friendly\" beat, thudding synthesizers and a pan flute breakdown. Noted to be a shift from more sweet and coy-sounding tracks on Aquarius, Tinashe solicits a snarling technique in her vocal delivery, together with a more upbeat attitude and in contrast with Azalea's braggadocio. On the promotional remix single, Azalea's rapped verse occurs halfway through the song's duration, at its bridge, with the rapper announcing herself as \"Iggs\". Described as the \"sister song\" to Aquarius lead single \"2 On\", \"All Hands on Deck\" also garnered comparisons to Cassie's \"Long Way 2 Go\""

The single peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Outside the United Kingdom, \"I'm Too Sexy\" topped the charts in seven countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United States.\nThe idea for the song came about when the Fairbrass brothers were running a gym in London where, according to Richard, there was \"lots of narcissism and posing\". One day, he took his shirt off and started singing \"I'm too sexy for my shirt\" in front of a mirror as a joke. The band originally recorded it as an indie rock song.\nIt was rejected by multiple record companies before they played it to radio plugger Guy Holmes. He was initially unimpressed after playing it on his car stereo, but his passengers latched onto the song's \"I'm a model, you know what I mean\" hook and Holmes asked the band if they could rework it as a dance track.\nDJ TommyD, an acquaintance of Richard Fairbrass, programmed electronics around the original vocal, whilst guitarist Rob Manzoli added a riff borrowed from the Jimi Hendrix song \"Third Stone from the Sun\".\nIn the clubs, many people imitated their \"catwalk\" dance as seen on the video clip by January 1992.\nThe single was released on 15 July 1991. It equalled the record for the most weeks at number two on the UK Singles Chart without ever topping the chart, staying at number two for six weeks in a row while held back by Bryan Adams' \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\" (this equalled the previous record set by Father Abraham's 1978 hit \"The Smurf Song\").\nIn May 1992, the song was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for Best Selling 'A' Side. \"I'm Too Sexy\" was the act's first of several hits, particularly in the United Kingdom. They went on to have a number one single on the UK Singles Chart with \"Deeply Dippy\" in April 1992. In April 2008, the song was rated No. 49 on \"The 50 Worst Songs Ever! Watch, Listen and Cringe!\" by Blender.\nAllMusic editor Stephen Schnee described the song as a \"humorous yet misunderstood swipe at self centered male bodybuilders and models.\" David Taylor-Wilson from Bay Area Reporter called it \"a campy send-up of the fashion world.\" In November 1991, Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"Thoroughly fun and goofy ditty recently heated up international dance floors and radio airwaves. Fred cheekily boasts about his physical attributes over a festive pop/house groove, which should have no trouble duplicating its success here.\" Andy Kastanas from The Charlotte Observer stated, \"This midtempo \"techno/house\" beat has a catchy hook and unusual deep male vocals (a la Elmer Fudd on steriods) that'll put a meltdown on any ladies in the vicinity. You'll dance whether you like it or not and the lyrics are sure to give you some chucks when you sing along (and you WILL sing along)... \"I'm too sexy for my car, too sexy for your party, too sexy for this song, too sexy it hurts\" and on and on.\" British magazine Music Week deemed it a \"eccentric\" and \"amusingly muttered 121.7bpm pop rattler\". Matt Stopera and Brian Galindo from BuzzFeed ranked it number 90 in their list of The 101 Greatest Dance Songs of the '90s in 2017, adding, \"Yes, this song is cheesy as hell, but it doesn't ever try to be anything other than what it is: a fun, catchy, campy dance song.\" Randy Clark and Bryan Devaney from Cashbox said, \"Here is a fun, tongue-in-cheek dance tune that should get lots of club play.\" They concluded that the group \"have put together a clever dance/club put-down of what could only be the whole fashion-model \"poser\" attitude that's so much in vogue.\" A reviewer from People Magazine described it as a \"dopey dance tune mocking fashion models and voguers\u2014but it'll keep you moving.\"\nIn June 2007, the song was voted No. 80 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s.

It was released digitally in the United States on April 7, 2009, to US radio on April 28, 2009, and in the UK on August 10, 2009. The song contains a sample of Steam's \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\". An uptempop dance pop track, the lyrics of the song deal with DeBarge getting over her ex-boyfriend. A music video was released to promote the song, which features DeBarge and her friends stealing her ex-boyfriend's car and driving to various locations, including a house party. Throughout the video, DeBarge is seen flirting with several men in an attempt to get back at her ex-boyfriend.\nDespite the mixed critical reception, it achieved some commercial success, peaking in the top forty in Sweden and the top twenty in Canada and the United States, but it fared better as a dance single, peaking at number three on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Despite the minimal chart performance of the single, it has become her biggest hit to date, as well as her only single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US.\n\"Goodbye\" was one of the first songs that was recorded for the album. During an interview with TheStarScoop, DeBarge said of the first time she heard the song on the radio,\n\"I was screaming up and down. I was actually at home and listening to New York Radio Online. I had called all my friends, telling them to listen. My mom video taped me. It was really surreal for me. Every time I hear my song on the radio, I just take it in and [it's] so cool. It\u2019s me!\"\n\n\"Goodbye\" is generally considered a pop-dance track. J!-ENT described the song as \"an upbeat, addictive track utilizing the classic 1969 Steam track \u201cNa Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\u201d. A wonderful debut single for Kristinia.\" People magazine praised the song and compared it to recent releases by Rihanna, stating \"First single 'Goodbye', an undeniable dance-pop confection, recalls Rihanna's 'S.O.S. (Rescue Me)', reworking Steam's 1969 hit 'Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye' much like 'S.O.S. (Rescue Me)' did 'Tainted Love'.\" Meanwhile, upon the song's UK release, noted R&B writer Pete Lewis of the 'Blues & Soul' referred to it as \"a punchy, upbeat single whose hook prominently samples the familiar hook from Steam's 1969 American Number One 'Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Godbye'\". Nick Levine of Digital Spy said, \"Like a low calorie chocolate bar, 'Goodbye' is sweet enough in the moment, but it doesn't have enough substance to leave you feeling really satisfied.\"\nGlenn Gamboa of Newsday said that \"DeBarge comes across as a streetwise Jordin Sparks on the \"stomping smash\". People called the song \"an undeniable dance-pop confection\". Time said that the song is \"so enjoyably trashy, it's a wonder no one thought of it before.\"\n\"Goodbye\" received generally mixed reviews from critics. Commonsensemedia praised the song, stating \"It's quite a feat to breathe new life into a song that has taken on such a life of its own. But DeBarge is able to make this song uniquely her own and put a funky dance twist on a classic. This young singer appears to have inherited the family talent for mass-appeal music with an easygoing style.\" DigitalSpy said of the single, \"Honestly, you wait years for someone to sample the hook from 'Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye', and then everyone does it at once! It backs Wale and Lady GaGa on 'Chillin', Jay-Z uses it to shoo off pop's most controversial vocal effect on 'D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)', and here's US newbie Kristinia DeBarge swallowing it whole on her debut single. Blame it on the over-familiarity of the sample, or maybe the fact that DeBarge nicks a trick from Rihanna's 'SOS (Rescue Me)' here, but the result isn't quite the pop smash it could be. The crux of the issue? Like a low calorie chocolate bar, 'Goodbye' is sweet enough in the moment, but it doesn't have enough substance to leave you feeling really satisfied.\"\nHeavenlyReviews praised the song as well, stating \"\"Goodbye\", this song is one of those strong anthem breakup songs that the rhythm just kinds gets stuck in your head and for the next seven days you will be singing this song, humming this song, and thinking about this song.\" Bisaidso were very critical of DeBarge, commenting \"Damn, we can\u2019t go five years without a new DeBarge trying to break into the music biz, can we? Her debut album (written and produced by Babyface) should out this summer. Let\u2019s hope young Kristinia doesn\u2019t end up with a rap sheet like"

The song was written by Kerli, Jean Baptiste, Mick McHenry and Ryan Buendia and was produced by Free School Music and Jean Baptiste. It was released on December 16, 2010, via free download on Kerli's official website. It was released for purchase as a single on April 12, 2011. A 9-track remix EP was released on May 3, 2011, and part 2 was released on June 21, 2011.\nThe song charted on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play Songs chart for a total of 11 weeks, and peaked at number 1 for the week of May 7, 2011. \"Army of Love\" was number 12 on the 2011 Billboard Year-End Dance/Club Songs chart.\nKerli announced on November 4, 2010, that the first promotional single from her sophomore album would be titled \"Army of Love\" and that the video had nearly finished production.\n\"Army of Love\" was written by Kerli, Jean Baptiste, Michael McHenry and Ryan Buendia. It was produced by Free School Music and Baptiste. \"Army of Love\" features a very distinct rhythmic electronic beat primarily consisting of an electronic keyboard, synths and a short drum beat. The song samples melody from 3 AM Eternal by the KLF.\nAbout.com Dance Music / Electronica's DJ Ron Slomowicz selected the track as \"Song of the Day\", stating \"Whether blatantly selling out or making a true artistic shift in musical direction, 'Army of Love' is catchy and may just make Kerli more accessible across the board. \"\nThe song debuted at number 51 on the Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart and after eleven weeks, peaked at number 1.\nIt also peaked at number 3 on the \"Raadio Uuno Top 40\" and number 10 on the Estonian Top 40.\nThe music video officially premiered on December 22 on YouTube through Kerli's Vevo channel.\nThe video was filmed over several days in Estonia. It was directed by Kaimar Kukk.\nThe first scene of the video is Kerli sitting a child's bedroom in a rocking chair, playing with a Rubik's Cube. The video cuts to Kerli in an abandoned warehouse where she picks up a phone and announces \"Moonchildren, prepare to take over the universe\". The song then begins with Kerli singing the lyrics into a megaphone as various people (presumably Moonchildren) emerge from different places and march alongside her as she continues singing, thus building the \"army\" mentioned throughout the song. They follow her into a forest, where she finds a unicorn. Several cut-in scenes depict Kerli as an elven princess swinging on a wooden swing, as well as Kerli performing the song on a truck stage for an audience of enthusiastic Moonchildren. The final scene of the video is the Moonchildren marching after Kerli as she rides the unicorn off into the forest, and the video is subsequently concluded by a title screen proclaiming \"To Be Continued...\"\nIn the first half of video, up until the point where the song begins, the words \"integrity\", \"love\", and \"unity\" can be heard whispered by Kerli. Phrases such as \"integrity\", \"love\", \"unity\", \"we're coming\", \"follow me,\" and \"K713\" also blink on and off screen throughout the video.\nAs of January 2015, the music video has 4,607,958 views on YouTube.Review site Idolator said that the song's music video is the \"hottest rave to hit Middle Earth, \" referencing the works of J. R. R.

The song was written in 1999 by frontman Fran Healy while produced by Nigel Godrich and recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles. It was released as the album's lead single in the United States on 23 April 2001. Healy originally titled \"the melody \"Swing\" but eventually changed the title for the song to \"Sing\", making it about working past the troubles of a relationship by not being afraid to let oneself go and sing in front of a loved one. The song is noted for its prominent use of the banjo, played by lead guitarist Andy Dunlop, and contains a string arrangement performed by Millennia Strings.\n\"Sing\" received acclaim from contemporary music critics, who often praised its writing and production. The song became the band's highest-charting single in their home country, peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart. It was a worldwide success as well, reaching the top 10 in several other European countries, including France, peaking at number two, and New Zealand. In the US, the song reached the top 40 of the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs and Modern Rock Tracks charts.\nA music video for the song was released on 20 April 2001\u2014it was directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. Filmed in Pasadena, California over three days, it features Travis attending a dinner party that eventually turns into a massive food fight. When Travis appeared on British music programme Top of the Pops, the band members threw pies at each other and the audience while the track played in the background. The video was nominated for Best British Video at the 2002 Brit Awards.\nFran Healy explained on the band's official website that he wrote the song in 1999 the day before he planned to go to the studio to record the B-sides for their 1999 single\" \"Turn\". He came up with the song as he watched a swingbeat video on MTV, leading him to compose a basic melody called \"Swing\" on his guitar. Healy liked the results and said that he appreciated the free chorus and verse melody. \"It really felt like it took to the air\", he said on the band's official website. The following day, after recording the B-side \"We Are Monkeys\", Healy began to play the song's chords while the track was rewinding, and the rest of his bandmates soon joined him. Healy then asked for the production of \"We Are Monkeys\" to be put on hold so they could record a demo of the new composition. As he performed with the rest of Travis, he changed the word \"swing\" to \"sing\" on the chorus. Since lead guitarist Andy Dunlop had brought his banjo into the studio for \"We Are Monkeys\", the instrument was overdubbed into the recording.\nThe night after recording the demo, Healy decided to change all instances of \"swing\" to \"sing\" and modify the lyrics so that the song described the healing powers of singing. The track was recorded between October 2000 and March 2001 at Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, California, and was included on The Invisible Band as the opening track. Along with \"Flowers in the Window\", Healy dedicated the song to his wife Nora Kryst in the album booklet. In the United States, record label Independiente added \"Sing\" to triple A radio on 23 April 2001 and to alternative radio the following day, while in the United Kingdom, the label serviced the song to radio during the same month and issued it as a physical single on 28 May 2001. The song was released on CD in Australia on the same day.\nMusically, \"Sing\" is a pop song with folk elements, which includes a banjo played by Dunlop. Robert Wilonsky of the Dallas Observer described the song as \"front-porch blues, if your front porch opens onto central London\". Set in common time, it is written in the key of F\u266f minor and has a tempo of 80 beats per minute. Healy sings lead vocals and plays guitar while Dougie Payne plays bass and Neil Primrose plays the drums. Dunlop additionally plays piano on the song. The song begins with a synth chord that leads into a rhythm consisting of strumming guitars and the banjo. Additional strings"

It was released on 25 July 2010 as the debut single from their self-titled debut album The Wanted, via Geffen Records. The song peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and number 19 in Ireland. \"All Time Low\" is upbeat with prominent dance-pop musical characteristics. It has so far garnered a positive response from contemporary music critics.\nThe song was accompanied by a music video which was released on 3 June 2010. The Wanted have performed \"All Time Low\" live at the Summertime Ball, Arqiva Awards, and on various television shows including: GMTV and The Hollyoaks Music Show, and online shows such as SBTV and The 5:19 Show. On 2 July 2010, BBC online magazine Slink used \"All Time Low\" in their 'Snapped' feature. \"All Time Low\" was also released as the band's debut single in the United States on 1 July 2011, also becoming the lead single from the group's debut stateside release, extended play The Wanted.\nAfter forming and being signed to Geffen Records in 2010 through mass auditioning, the Wanted recorded \"All Time Low\". It was one of six songs recorded by the band at the time for their debut album due for release in late 2010. The track was co-written by its producer Steve Mac in collaboration with Wayne Hector and Ed Drewett. It was mixed by Dann Pursey and Ren Swan. Lyrically, \"All Time Low\" is written in reference to rising from the difficulty of having someone special constantly on your mind. Speaking to Orange UK, Max George interpreted what the song was about: \"It's basically about a girl you can't get out of your mind - whatever you do, you just can't - and it describes how to get up from this all time low.\" Orange UK described \"All Time Low\" as having a \"lovesick\" theme to it. The lines \"Waiting at the station/I'm late for work, a vital presentation\" were said to take reference to Microsoft PowerPoint by music website Popjustice, while the line \"I'm in pieces, seems like peace is the only thing I'll never know\" was highlighted by Fraser McAlpine of the BBC as being the most memorable in the song in addition to having a devilish internal rhyme. \"All Time Low\" acts as the Wanted's debut single and first single from their debut album.\nThe single was first released on digital download format in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 25 July 2010. The following day, \"All Time Low\" was released on CD single format in both countries on 26 July 2010. In August 2010, they performed the song in Hannover, Germany at the Dome 55. On 11 September 2010, they performed the song at the Freedom Festival in Hull alongside \"Heart Vacancy\" and \"Lose My Mind\". In the United States, the single was released on 1 July 2011, however, it did not achieve any form of commercial success in the country. However, it did peaked within the top 20 of the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.\n\"All Time Low\" received critical praise from Ryan Love of Digital Spy who gave the song a four out of five star rating. The song was performed on Channel 4 on 15 August 2010. Love described the song as \"a bit of a surprise\" and gave praise to its opening \"quite simply immense\" strings. Love went on to call the song a \"fresh 'n' fizzy indie-tinged pop gem\". \"All Time Low\" received its second four out of five star rating after a review by Fraser McAlpine from the BBC. McAlpine reviewed the track mentioning: \"Now, for a transparent piece of silly old pop music, this has class cooties. The telltale signs are there in the string riff, and the mature, subtle way they approach the singing, and the restraint with which they have applied the autotune.\" He went on to say that the song was good despite sampling a melody from Coldplay's \"The Scientist\" (2002). McAlpine added that the song boasts a memorable line with a devilish internal rhyme: \"I'm in pieces, it seems like peace is the only thing I'll never know\".\n\"All Time Low\" entered at the top of the UK Singles Chart on 1 August 2010 \u2013 for the week ending dated 7 August 2010 \u2013 with first-week sales of 84,174 copies. It became their first number one single on the chart. In Ireland, the single peaked at number 13 on the Irish Singles Chart.

The song served as the album's second single on July 9, 2012 through Arista Nashville. Written by Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who previously wrote Underwood's single \"Before He Cheats\" (2007), \"Blown Away\" is a country pop song with lyrics addressing the story of a daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on the couch in the path of a tornado. Producer Mark Bright drew inspiration from 1980s music.\nUpon its release, \"Blown Away\" was met with positive reviews from music critics, who considered it to be the musical highlight of the album. The song's content and production received particular praise, as critics felt it confirmed the album's darker mood which Underwood had mentioned prior to its release. Commercially, \"Blown Away\" was successful. In the United States, it became her 13th number one hit on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, and also reached number 20 on the Hot 100. It also charted in Canada and the United Kingdom. It won several awards, including two Grammy Awards, for Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance. The song has since been certified 4x platinum by the RIAA.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Randee St. Nicholas. Underwood said that when she heard first the song, she already had ideas of a possible video for it. She wanted it to be a dark Wizard of Oz in 2012. It earned her an award for Video of the Year at the 2013 CMT Music Awards. The video was nominated for Music Video of the Year at the 2013 Country Music Association Awards. Underwood has performed \"Blown Away\" in a number of live appearances, including at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards, the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and two years in a row at the Country Music Association Awards. It was also performed as the encore of the Blown Away Tour (2012\u201313).\nAfter Underwood's Play On Tour wrapped in December 2010, she started to work on her fourth studio album, which was then untitled. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer \"took nearly a year to compile and record the songs.\" Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who previously wrote \"Before He Cheats\" for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts (2005), worked on \"Blown Away\" initially without a specific artist in mind. At first, they built the drums and the string parts that of the introduction and verses. Tompkins started playing his keyboard to find sound effects for the introduction, and ended up using one that was a thunderstorm. \"I think that's what kind of threw us into it. We just started writing it,\" he said.\nThe songwriters then came up with the first verse of the song: \"Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / Her daddy was a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down.\" Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song. As they wrote the pre-chorus line \"not enough rain in Oklahoma\", both knew that it was a Carrie Underwood song, as the singer is from that state. \"We knew if we stuck with that lyric [\"Oklahoma\"\u2014which is Carrie's home state] it was Carrie's song or maybe no one would ever record it,\" Kear commented.\nAfter the theme of the song had been established, the songwriters wanted to \"dig up as much drama as [they] could.\" Lyrically, \"Blown Away\" tells the story of a daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on the couch in the path of a tornado. Underwood revealed that \"Blown Away\" was the song that defined the direction of the album, and recalled the first time she heard the demo:\n\"I listened to it on my crappy computer speakers and then I had to go find my headphones because as soon as I listened to a few bars, I had to listen more closely and I got chills. I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It\u2019s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they [told me], 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song is never going to see the light of day.' It made me feel so good that they were thinking of me when they wrote it.\"\nAs noted by interviewer Kurt Wolff, \"the melody and overall sound of the song also stand out as something fresh and very different.\" Tompkins explained to Wolff that \"Blown Away\" was an \"attempt at"

It was released on 25 July 2010 as the debut single from their self-titled debut album The Wanted, via Geffen Records. The song peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and number 19 in Ireland. \"All Time Low\" is upbeat with prominent dance-pop musical characteristics. It has so far garnered a positive response from contemporary music critics.\nThe song was accompanied by a music video which was released on 3 June 2010. The Wanted have performed \"All Time Low\" live at the Summertime Ball, Arqiva Awards, and on various television shows including: GMTV and The Hollyoaks Music Show, and online shows such as SBTV and The 5:19 Show. On 2 July 2010, BBC online magazine Slink used \"All Time Low\" in their 'Snapped' feature. \"All Time Low\" was also released as the band's debut single in the United States on 1 July 2011, also becoming the lead single from the group's debut stateside release, extended play The Wanted.\nAfter forming and being signed to Geffen Records in 2010 through mass auditioning, the Wanted recorded \"All Time Low\". It was one of six songs recorded by the band at the time for their debut album due for release in late 2010. The track was co-written by its producer Steve Mac in collaboration with Wayne Hector and Ed Drewett. It was mixed by Dann Pursey and Ren Swan. Lyrically, \"All Time Low\" is written in reference to rising from the difficulty of having someone special constantly on your mind. Speaking to Orange UK, Max George interpreted what the song was about: \"It's basically about a girl you can't get out of your mind - whatever you do, you just can't - and it describes how to get up from this all time low.\" Orange UK described \"All Time Low\" as having a \"lovesick\" theme to it. The lines \"Waiting at the station/I'm late for work, a vital presentation\" were said to take reference to Microsoft PowerPoint by music website Popjustice, while the line \"I'm in pieces, seems like peace is the only thing I'll never know\" was highlighted by Fraser McAlpine of the BBC as being the most memorable in the song in addition to having a devilish internal rhyme. \"All Time Low\" acts as the Wanted's debut single and first single from their debut album.\nThe single was first released on digital download format in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 25 July 2010. The following day, \"All Time Low\" was released on CD single format in both countries on 26 July 2010. In August 2010, they performed the song in Hannover, Germany at the Dome 55. On 11 September 2010, they performed the song at the Freedom Festival in Hull alongside \"Heart Vacancy\" and \"Lose My Mind\". In the United States, the single was released on 1 July 2011, however, it did not achieve any form of commercial success in the country. However, it did peaked within the top 20 of the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.\n\"All Time Low\" received critical praise from Ryan Love of Digital Spy who gave the song a four out of five star rating. The song was performed on Channel 4 on 15 August 2010. Love described the song as \"a bit of a surprise\" and gave praise to its opening \"quite simply immense\" strings. Love went on to call the song a \"fresh 'n' fizzy indie-tinged pop gem\". \"All Time Low\" received its second four out of five star rating after a review by Fraser McAlpine from the BBC. McAlpine reviewed the track mentioning: \"Now, for a transparent piece of silly old pop music, this has class cooties. The telltale signs are there in the string riff, and the mature, subtle way they approach the singing, and the restraint with which they have applied the autotune.\" He went on to say that the song was good despite sampling a melody from Coldplay's \"The Scientist\" (2002). McAlpine added that the song boasts a memorable line with a devilish internal rhyme: \"I'm in pieces, it seems like peace is the only thing I'll never know\".\n\"All Time Low\" entered at the top of the UK Singles Chart on 1 August 2010 \u2013 for the week ending dated 7 August 2010 \u2013 with first-week sales of 84,174 copies. It became their first number one single on the chart. In Ireland, the single peaked at number 13 on the Irish Singles Chart.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Written by lead guitarist George Harrison, it was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after \"Love You To\", and was inspired by his stay in India in late 1966 with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar. Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, tambura, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle. The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.\nThe song was Harrison's only composition on Sgt. Pepper, although his endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover. With the worldwide success of the album, \"Within You Without You\" presented Indian classical music to a new audience in the West and contributed to the genre's peak in international popularity. It also influenced the philosophical direction of many of Harrison's peers during an era of utopian idealism marked by the Summer of Love. The song has traditionally received a varied response from music critics, some of whom find it lacklustre and pretentious, while others admire its musical authenticity and consider the message to be the most meaningful on Sgt. Pepper. Writing for Rolling Stone, David Fricke described the track as being \"at once beautiful and severe, a magnetic sermon about materialism and communal responsibility in the middle of a record devoted to gentle Technicolor anarchy\".\nFor the Beatles' 2006 remix album Love, the song was mixed with the John Lennon-written \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", creating what some reviewers consider to be that project's most successful mashup. Sonic Youth, Rainer Ptacek, Oasis, Patti Smith, Cheap Trick and the Flaming Lips are among the artists who have covered \"Within You Without You\".\nGeorge Harrison began writing \"Within You Without You\" in early 1967 while at the house of musician and artist Klaus Voormann, in the north London suburb of Hampstead. Harrison's immediate inspiration for the song came from a conversation they had shared over dinner about the metaphysical space that prevents individuals from recognising the natural forces uniting the world. Following this discussion, Harrison worked out the song's melody on a harmonium and came up with the opening line: \"We were talking about the space between us all\".\nThe song was Harrison's second composition to be explicitly influenced by Indian classical music, after \"Love You To\", which featured Indian instruments such as sitar, tabla and tambura. Since recording the latter track for the Beatles' Revolver in April 1966, Harrison had continued to look outside his role as the band's lead guitarist, further immersing himself in studying the sitar, partly under the tutelage of master sitarist Ravi Shankar. Harrison said that the tune for \"Within You Without You\" came about through his regularly performing musical exercises known as sargam, which use the same scales as those found in Indian ragas.\n\"Within You Without You\" is the first of Harrison's many songs to include Hindu spiritual concepts in his lyrics. Having incorporated elements of Eastern philosophy in \"Love You To\", Harrison became fascinated by ancient Hindu teachings after he and his wife, Pattie Boyd, visited Shankar in India in September\u2013October 1966. Intent on mastering the sitar, Harrison first joined other students of Shankar's in Bombay, until local fans and the press learned of his arrival. Harrison, Boyd, Shankar and the latter's partner, Kamala Chakravarty, then relocated to a houseboat on Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir. There, Harrison received personal tuition from Shankar while absorbing religious texts such as Paramahansa Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi and Swami Vivekananda's Raja Yoga. This period coincided with his introduction to meditation and, during their visit to Vrindavan, he witnessed communal chanting for the first time.\nHarrison and Boyd returned to England on 22 October, and continued to adhere to a Hindu-aligned lifestyle of yoga, meditation and vegetarianism at their home in Esher.

Written by George Harrison as a social commentary, the song serves as an Orwellian satire on greed and consumerism. Among several elements it incorporates from classical music, the track features harpsichord and orchestral strings in the baroque pop style, which are contrasted by Harrison's acerbic lyrics and the sound of grunting pigs. Although credited to George Martin, the recording was largely produced by Chris Thomas, who also contributed the harpsichord part.\nIn the context of the turbulent political climate of 1968, \"Piggies\" was adopted by the counterculture as an anti-establishment theme song. It was also among the tracks on The Beatles that cult leader Charles Manson used as the foundation for his Helter Skelter theory of an American race-related countercultural revolution. Inspired especially by the line \"What they need's a damn good whacking\", Manson's followers left clues relating to the lyrics at the scenes of the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders in August 1969.\n\"Piggies\" has received widely varying responses from music critics, and its reputation suffered due to the association with Manson following the latter's trial in 1971. While some reviewers admire its musical qualities and recognise sardonic humour in the lyrics, others consider the song to be mean-spirited and lacking in subtlety. Harrison's demo of the song, recorded at his home in Surrey, was included on the Beatles' 1996 compilation Anthology 3. A live version by Harrison, reinstating a verse that was omitted from the studio recording, appears on his 1992 album Live in Japan. Folk singer and activist Theo Bikel and anarcho-punk musician Danbert Nobacon are among the artists who have covered \"Piggies\".\nGeorge Harrison began writing \"Piggies\" in early 1966, around the time that the Beatles were recording their album Revolver. He returned to the song two years later, after discovering his manuscript in the attic of his parents' house in Liverpool. The same visit led to Harrison starting a new composition, \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", which he similarly completed for inclusion on the Beatles' self-titled double album (also known as \"the White Album\").\nAs an anti-establishment song, \"Piggies\" recalls Harrison's Revolver composition \"Taxman\". In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison describes \"Piggies\" as a social commentary. He intended it as a light-hearted satire on consumerism and class distinction. Through its theme of social strata within a community of farm animals (in this case, one consisting entirely of pigs), the song references George Orwell's 1945 novel Animal Farm. According to Harrison's early draft of \"Piggies\", the lyrics contained a final verse, subsequently cut for the Beatles' recording, that ends with the animals \"Paying piggy thanks \u2013 to thee Pig Brother!\" Musicologist Walter Everett cites these words as evidence that Harrison's main inspiration for the song was Orwell's work, particularly \"his fable of autocracy masquerading as democracy, Animal Farm\". While also identifying Orwell's book as an influence on the composition, author Ian Inglis views \"Piggies\" as one of several White Album songs in which the Beatles drew inspiration from their childhood in the 1940s.\nDuring Harrison's Liverpool visit in early 1968, his mother, Louise, responded to his request for assistance with the lyrics by providing the line \"What they need's a damn good whacking\". Harrison then taped a demo of the song at his house in Esher, Surrey, in late May that year. Following this recording, John Lennon supplied the final phrase in the line \"Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon\", replacing the words \"to cut their pork chops\", which Harrison had sung on the demo version. When performing \"Piggies\" in concert during the early 1990s, Harrison reinstated the omitted final verse.\nFrom 1966, particularly in the United States, the slang usage of the word \"pig\" had grown from being a derogatory term for a police officer to refer also to consumerism and establishment figures in general. This was especially so in 1968, as the counterculture became more politically focused, coinciding with the rise of the Black Power movement and the number of mass demonstrations against America's involvement in the Vietnam War. Although author Jon Wiener terms Harrison and Lennon \"the radicals among the Beatles\", citing their past outspokenness about Vietnam and their readiness to embrace LSD experimentation and Transcendental Meditation, Harrison denied that he was using \"pig\" in its"

It reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming a defining track of the Britpop movement as well as Pulp's signature song in the process. In 2014, BBC Radio 6 Music listeners voted it their favourite Britpop song in an online poll. In a 2015 Rolling Stone readers' poll it was voted the greatest Britpop song.\nThe song is a critique on those who were perceived as wanting to be \"like common people\" and who ascribe glamour to poverty. This phenomenon is referred to as slumming or \"class tourism\". The song was written by the band members Jarvis Cocker, Nick Banks, Candida Doyle, Steve Mackey and Russell Senior. Cocker had conceived the song after meeting a Greek art student while studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London (the college and the student feature in the lyrics). He came up with the tune on a Casiotone keyboard he had bought in a music store in Notting Hill, west London.\nJustin Myers of the Official Charts Company wrote, '\"Common People\" was typical Pulp \u2013 a biting satire of posh people \u2018roughing it\u2019 and acting like tourists by hanging with the \"common people\". Jarvis delivered his scathing putdown with glee, in an iconic music video featuring actress Sadie Frost as the posho on the receiving end of Jarvis' acid tongue.' Pulp first performed the song in public during the band's set at the Reading Festival in August 1994. A year later they performed it at Glastonbury Festival as the headline act. The song has since been covered by various artists. In 2004, a Ben Folds-produced cover version by William Shatner brought \"Common People\" to new audiences outside Europe.\nThe idea for the song's lyrics came from a Greek art student whom Pulp singer-songwriter Jarvis Cocker met while he was studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Cocker had enrolled in a film studies course at the college in September 1988 while taking a break from Pulp. He spoke about the song's inspiration in NME in 2013:\nI'd met the girl from the song many years before, when I was at St Martin's College. I'd met her on a sculpture course, but at St Martin's you had a thing called Crossover Fortnight, where you had to do another discipline for a couple of weeks. I was studying film, and she might've been doing painting, but we both decided to do sculpture for two weeks. I don't know her name. It would've been around 1988, so it was already ancient history when I wrote about her.\nIn a 2012 question-and-answer session on BBC Radio 5 Live Cocker said that he was having a conversation with the girl at the bar at college because he was attracted to her, although he found some aspects of her personality unpleasant. He remembered that at one point she had told him she \"wanted to move to Hackney and live like 'the common people'\u2009\". Cocker used this phrase as the starting point for the song and embellished the situation for dramatic effect, for example reversing the situation in the song when the female character declares that \"I want to sleep with common people like you\" (Cocker said that in real life he had been the one wanting to sleep with the girl, while she had not been interested in him). Taking this inspiration, the narrator explains that his female acquaintance can \"never be like common people\", because even if she gets a flat where \"roaches climb the wall\" ultimately, \"if [she] called [her] dad he could stop it all\", in contrast to the true common people who can only \"watch [their] lives slide out of view\".\nA BBC Three documentary failed to locate the woman, who, Cocker stated, could have been in any fine art course but that \"sculpture\" sounded better. The lyrics were in part a response by Cocker, who usually focused on the introspective and emotional aspects of pop, to more politically minded members of the band like Russell Senior. Furthermore, Cocker felt that 'slumming' was becoming a dominant theme in popular culture and this contributed to the single's rushed release. Cocker said \"it seemed to be in the air, that kind of patronising social voyeurism... I felt that of Parklife, for example, or Natural Born Killers \u2013 there is that noble savage notion. But if you walk round a council estate, there's plenty of savagery and not much nobility going on.\"\nIn May 2015, Greek newspaper Athens Voice"

Written by Noel Gallagher, the song was released as the third single from their debut album Definitely Maybe (1994) on 8 August 1994, just prior to that album's release. Gallagher wrote the song in 1991, before he joined Oasis.\nInspired by the Rolling Stones' \"Shine a Light\", \"Live Forever\" features a basic song structure and lyrics with an optimistic outlook that contrasted with the attitude of the grunge bands popular at the time. The song was the first Oasis single to enter the top ten in the United Kingdom, and garnered critical acclaim. In 2017, lead singer Liam Gallagher declared the song his favorite Oasis song. The British Phonographic Industry certified the song double platinum in August 2021.\nNoel Gallagher began working on \"Live Forever\" in 1991, while working for a building company in his hometown of Manchester. After his foot was crushed by a pipe in an accident, he was given a less-strenuous job working in the storeroom, allowing him more time to write songs. One night, he was listening to the Rolling Stones' album Exile on Main St.; while playing one of his own chord progressions, Gallagher noted that it sounded good against one of the vocal melodies from the album: \"It was the bit from \"Shine a Light\" that goes [sings], \"May the good Lord shine a light on you\"\", Gallagher recalled. Gallagher incorporated the melody, changing the line to \"Maybe I don't really want to know\". For a period afterwards, that was the only part of the song Gallagher had completed.\nNoel Gallagher presented a fully composed \"Live Forever\" to the band for the first time in early 1993 during rehearsals. According to drummer Tony McCarroll, the band were admittedly awed by it. The song was later instrumental in helping the band secure their record deal with Creation Records. Reflecting on when he first heard the song, Creation boss Alan McGee recalled, \"It was probably the single greatest moment I've ever experienced with them\".\nThe demo version of \"Live Forever\" begins with an acoustic guitar intro. While recording the album version, the record's producer Owen Morris cut out this intro and replaced it with a drumbeat played by McCarroll. Morris further cut a second section in Gallagher's guitar solo. Gallagher was bemused by Morris' decision, and jokingly asked him through manager Marcus Russell to \"not cut it in half again on the final mix\".  Morris said that the removed part made him think of \"Slash in leather keks with a wind machine on the Grand Canyon\".\n\"Live Forever\" is in the key of G major (varispeeded up by less than half a semitone during mixing) and is based on a G\u2013D\u2013Am\u2013C\u2013D chord progression, with the G chord becoming an Em during the pre-chorus, though the key changes to A minor following the last chorus. The vocal melody only consists of a few notes. The simplistic arrangement of the song \"meant the song never resolved\". Guitarist Paul Arthurs said, \"for me that song could keep going.\"\nThe song begins with a voice whistling briefly and saying \"Oh yeah\", followed by a drum beat that plays unaccompanied for a few measures. An intermingling of the main guitar line, piano notes, and Liam Gallagher's vocals then enter. Each verse begins with Liam singing the phrase \"Maybe/I don't really wanna know/How your garden grows/'Cause I just wanna fly\", and each verse ends with the falsetto refrain. A guitar solo appears after the second refrain of \"You and I are gonna live forever\". After the third verse and refrain section, Liam Gallagher repeats the line \"Gonna live forever!\" four times with 'ache in his voice', followed by one final guitar solo.\nThe song is interpreted to be an ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that \"At the time . . . it was written in the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like . . . 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him [Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain] and all that shit, I'm not having that. I"

The artists co-wrote the song with its producers Afrojack, Diplo, and Free School, with additional writing from Ryan Buendia. Musically, \"Look at Me Now\" is a \"dirty south\u2013inspired\" hip hop song that features \"thumping bass, spacy synth and horn jam sounds.\"\nCritical reception towards the song was positive, where critics noted it as a standout track on the album, and praised Busta Rhymes and Lil Wayne's rap verses. \"Look at Me Now\" proved to be successful in the United States, where it reached number\u00a0six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it Brown's highest chart position since \"Forever\" (2008). It also reached number\u00a0one on the Hot\u00a0Rap\u00a0Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. Internationally, the song charted in Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Colin Tilley and filmed in Los Angeles, California. It features numerous scenes of Brown, Busta Rhymes, and Lil Wayne in a smoke-filled, graffiti-covered parking garage, where a Step Up-type dance-off is held. The video received a positive response from critics for displaying various colors and intricate routines performed by Brown and several dancers. The song won three awards at the 2011 BET Awards for Best Collaboration, Viewer's Choice and Video of the Year. Several artists have covered the song and released their own remixes, including Karmin, Justin Bieber, Trey Songz and Da Brat.\nThe artists co-wrote \"Look at Me Now\" with its producers Afrojack, Diplo, and Free School, with additional writing from Ryan Buendia. The song was recorded and mixed by Brian Springer at The Record Plant\u2014a studio in Los Angeles, California. \"Look at Me Now\" was released for digital download on February 1, 2011, and was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States on February 8. In an interview with Vibe magazine, Diplo revealed that when he was first asked to put the song together, he thought that \"Look at Me Now\" was not for an official release, saying: \"I knew that I was working on something for a Chris Brown record, but I thought it was for a mixtape... When I did the beat, I gave it to one of his writers. Then Busta Rhymes got on it and I was like, 'Okay, this is going to be a club record.' And then when Wayne got on it 'Look at Me Now' became a radio record. It just took off from there.\"\n\"Look at Me Now\" is a \"dirty south\u2013inspired\" hip hop song that features American rappers Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes. According to Chad Grischow from IGN, the song features \"thumping bass, spacy synth and horn jam sounds.\" Electronic background mixes are also present in the song. Over a hip hop drum beat that evokes Cali Swag District's 2010 single \"Teach Me How to Dougie\", \"Brown sings that he's still riding high (in a yellow Lamborghini, to boot) before venturing off into a typically tasteless discussion of his manhood\", according to staff members from Idolator. Jon Caramanica from The New York Times also wrote that on the song, Brown \"double-time-raps about stealing girlfriends.\" Akshay Bhansali from MTV News wrote that \"Look\u00a0at\u00a0Me\u00a0Now\" features \"a fast-rapping flurry of awesome self-indulgence courtesy of Busta Rhymes, Lil Wayne and Chris, with an eerie downtempo beat cooked up by chefs Afrojack and Diplo.\" Afrojack told MTV News that the song was the product of a beat he passed to Diplo. \"Yeah, Diplo called me...

Written by Noel Gallagher, the song was released as the third single from their debut album Definitely Maybe (1994) on 8 August 1994, just prior to that album's release. Gallagher wrote the song in 1991, before he joined Oasis.\nInspired by the Rolling Stones' \"Shine a Light\", \"Live Forever\" features a basic song structure and lyrics with an optimistic outlook that contrasted with the attitude of the grunge bands popular at the time. The song was the first Oasis single to enter the top ten in the United Kingdom, and garnered critical acclaim. In 2017, lead singer Liam Gallagher declared the song his favorite Oasis song. The British Phonographic Industry certified the song double platinum in August 2021.\nNoel Gallagher began working on \"Live Forever\" in 1991, while working for a building company in his hometown of Manchester. After his foot was crushed by a pipe in an accident, he was given a less-strenuous job working in the storeroom, allowing him more time to write songs. One night, he was listening to the Rolling Stones' album Exile on Main St.; while playing one of his own chord progressions, Gallagher noted that it sounded good against one of the vocal melodies from the album: \"It was the bit from \"Shine a Light\" that goes [sings], \"May the good Lord shine a light on you\"\", Gallagher recalled. Gallagher incorporated the melody, changing the line to \"Maybe I don't really want to know\". For a period afterwards, that was the only part of the song Gallagher had completed.\nNoel Gallagher presented a fully composed \"Live Forever\" to the band for the first time in early 1993 during rehearsals. According to drummer Tony McCarroll, the band were admittedly awed by it. The song was later instrumental in helping the band secure their record deal with Creation Records. Reflecting on when he first heard the song, Creation boss Alan McGee recalled, \"It was probably the single greatest moment I've ever experienced with them\".\nThe demo version of \"Live Forever\" begins with an acoustic guitar intro. While recording the album version, the record's producer Owen Morris cut out this intro and replaced it with a drumbeat played by McCarroll. Morris further cut a second section in Gallagher's guitar solo. Gallagher was bemused by Morris' decision, and jokingly asked him through manager Marcus Russell to \"not cut it in half again on the final mix\".  Morris said that the removed part made him think of \"Slash in leather keks with a wind machine on the Grand Canyon\".\n\"Live Forever\" is in the key of G major (varispeeded up by less than half a semitone during mixing) and is based on a G\u2013D\u2013Am\u2013C\u2013D chord progression, with the G chord becoming an Em during the pre-chorus, though the key changes to A minor following the last chorus. The vocal melody only consists of a few notes. The simplistic arrangement of the song \"meant the song never resolved\". Guitarist Paul Arthurs said, \"for me that song could keep going.\"\nThe song begins with a voice whistling briefly and saying \"Oh yeah\", followed by a drum beat that plays unaccompanied for a few measures. An intermingling of the main guitar line, piano notes, and Liam Gallagher's vocals then enter. Each verse begins with Liam singing the phrase \"Maybe/I don't really wanna know/How your garden grows/'Cause I just wanna fly\", and each verse ends with the falsetto refrain. A guitar solo appears after the second refrain of \"You and I are gonna live forever\". After the third verse and refrain section, Liam Gallagher repeats the line \"Gonna live forever!\" four times with 'ache in his voice', followed by one final guitar solo.\nThe song is interpreted to be an ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that \"At the time . . . it was written in the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like . . . 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him [Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain] and all that shit, I'm not having that. I"

It was written by the band's guitarist and main songwriter Noel Gallagher. The song was produced by Gallagher and Owen Morris. Released on 19 February 1996 as the fourth single from their second studio album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995), it became Oasis's second single to reach No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, earning a quadruple-platinum sales certification in the UK. It was the first Oasis single with lead vocals by Noel, who had previously only sung lead on B-sides, instead of his brother Liam. Noel would later sing lead vocals on six more singles.\nThe song is in the key of C, but pitched slightly sharp of the standard concert tuning of A 440 at 451. It is one of the band's signature songs, and was played at almost every single live show from its release to the dissolution of the band in 2009. In 2012, it was ranked No. 1 on a list of the \"50 Most Explosive Choruses\" by NME, and the same year it was voted the fourth-most-popular No. 1 single of the last 60 years in the UK by the public in conjunction with the Official Charts Company's 60th anniversary. In 2015, Rolling Stone readers voted it the second-greatest Britpop song after \"Common People\" by Pulp. On 29 May 2017, Absolute Radio 90s broadcast a programme counting down the top 50 songs written by Noel Gallagher to mark his 50th birthday, with the song being voted No. 1. In August 2020, the song was voted as the greatest song of the '90s by listeners of Absolute Radio 90s as part of celebrations for the station's tenth anniversary.\nNoel Gallagher was so excited about the potential of the song when he first wrote it that he used an acoustic set to perform a work-in-progress version, without the second verse and with a few other slight lyrical differences, at an Oasis concert at the Sheffield Arena on 22 April 1995. He said before playing that he'd only written it the previous Tuesday (18 April 1995) and that he didn't even have a title for it yet.\nNoel Gallagher said of the song, \"It reminds me of a cross between \"All the Young Dudes\" and something the Beatles might have done.\" Of the character \"Sally\" referred to in the song, he commented, \"I don't actually know anybody called Sally. It's just a word that fit, y'know, might as well throw a girl's name in there.\" He explained the song by saying, \"It's about not being upset about the things you might have said or done yesterday, which is quite appropriate at the moment. It's about looking forward rather than looking back. I hate people who look back on the past or talk about what might have been.\"\nIn August 2007, Gallagher told Uncut magazine, \"We were in Paris playing with the Verve, and I had the chords for that song and started writing it. We were due to play two days later. Our first-ever big arena gig, it's called Sheffield Arena now. At the sound check, I was strumming away on the acoustic guitar, and our kid (Liam) said, 'What's that you're singin'?' I wasn't singing anyway, I was just making it up. And our kid said, 'Are you singing, 'So Sally can wait'?' And I was like\u2014that's genius! So I started singing, 'So Sally can wait.' I remember going back to the dressing room and writing it out. It all came really quickly after that.\" Gallagher claims that the character \"Lyla\", from Oasis's 2005 single, is Sally's sister. In the interview on the DVD released with the special edition of Stop the Clocks, he also revealed that a girl approached him and asked him if Sally was the same girl mentioned in the Stone Roses track \"Sally Cinnamon\". He replied that he had never thought of that, but thought it was good reference anyway.\nIn a 2019 Esquire magazine interview, Gallagher stated, \"I remember writing it in Paris on a rainy night. We had just played a strip club: our set finished, the strippers came on. We were nothing, an insignificant little band. And I remember going back to my hotel room and writing it, and thinking, 'That'll be pretty good when we record it.' If I'd have known that night what I know now about people playing it at fucking funerals and weddings, I'd never have finished the song. Too much pressure.\"\nGallagher admits that certain lines from the song are lifted from John"

It was written and produced by Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg (known collectively as Bloodshy & Avant), with additional writing by Henrik Jonback and Angela Hunte. The song was never intended to be released as a single; Spears, however, wanted to shoot a music video for it, and had to convince her record company. It was then released on January 19, 2005, by Jive Records as the second single from the album outside North America. The dance-pop song features usage of electric guitars, and its lyrics allude to having a good time and not caring about other people's judgement.\n\"Do Somethin'\" received generally favorable reviews from critics, and received comparisons to Gwen Stefani's 2004 single \"What You Waiting For?\". Although the single was not released in the United States, it charted on many of Billboard's component charts due to digital downloads, managing to reach number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was also successful worldwide, reaching top ten positions in countries such as Australia, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. By the end of 2005, \"Do Somethin'\" was one of the best-selling singles in Australia and Belgium that year.\nSpears pushed Jive Records to allow her to shoot an accompanying music video for the song. The music video was co-directed by Billie Woodruff and Spears (who makes her directorial debut), and is credited as her alter ego \"Mona Lisa\", a reference to her alter ego from the song of the same name and from the scrapped Original Doll album. It portrays the singer and four female friends dancing and performing in a nightclub. Spears styled the video and came up with the choreography. The usage of a Louis Vuitton dashboard in the video resulted in a lawsuit against Jive Records in late 2007, which ended with Louis Vuitton winning \u20ac80,000 in damages. The video was also banned in all European TV channels. Spears performed \"Do Somethin'\" during The M+M's Tour in 2007, The Circus Starring Britney Spears in 2009 and Britney: Piece of Me in 2013\u201317.\nOn August 13, 2004, Spears announced through Jive Records the release of her first greatest hits compilation titled Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, due November 16, 2004. The title was chosen after the album's lead single, Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's 1988 single \"My Prerogative\". The cover was produced by Swedish production team Bloodshy & Avant, who produced her single \"Toxic\" from her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). A DVD of the same name was also released the same day, containing Spears's music videos. The track list was officially revealed on September 13, 2004. Greatest Hits: My Prerogative included three new tracks: \"My Prerogative\", \"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\" and \"Do Somethin'\", all of them produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The producers recorded and arranged the main instrumentation of \"Do Somethin'\" at Murlyn Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden. Spears recorded her vocals at Battery Studios in New York City during The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004. Background vocals were provided by Spears, Angela Hunte, BlackCell and Emma Holmgren.

The singer co-wrote the song with Justin Tranter, Kennedi Lykken, Mattias Larsson, Robin Fredriksson and Tom Holkenborg, while the production was handled by Mattman & Robin. Holkenborg also composed the soundtrack and orchestrations he created for it are used in the song. Announced in December 2018, the song was released for digital download and streaming on 24 January 2019 through Warner Bros. Records as the soundtrack's lead single.\n\"Swan Song\" is an electropop song set to muted electronics, cinematic horns and orchestral stabs. In the song, Lipa references 1980s AIDS activist group ACT UP and sings about new beginnings and society using their voices to fight for what they believe in. Several critics praised the song for the production. It was nominated for Best Original Song at the 24th Satellite Awards. Commercially, the song reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart and also reached the top 50 of charts in Belgium (Flanders), Ireland, Lithuania and Scotland. The song was awarded a gold certification in Poland from the Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry (ZPAV).\nThe music video for \"Swan Song\" was directed by Floria Sigismondi and accompanied the song's release. A blockbuster visual, it follows a loose synopsis of Alita: Battle Angel, specifically with the self-discovery themes. The video features Lipa and her crew in the fictional Iron City of the film. They encounter a giant robot and eventually Alita, before Lipa transforms into her towards the end. Several critics complimented the video's sci-fi themes. An acoustic version and a remixes extended play were released for further promotion.\nAt the end of 2018, Dua Lipa was contacted about an opportunity to create a song for the new film Alita: Battle Angel, which James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez had been working on. She accepted as she was instantly drawn to the film's titular character, Alita, and wanted to be a part of the film. The film team thought that Lipa would be a perfect fit for Alita: Battle Angel after seeing her music video for \"New Rules\". They thought her performance had the \"kick-ass strength, power and attitude\" Alita embodies in the film. Lipa was given the film's trailer and synopsis to begin, while she later got to see it prior to working on the song. Lipa wrote the song alongside Justin Tranter, Kennedi Lykken, Mattias Larsson, Robin Fredriksson and Tom Holkenborg. The singer found it exciting to write a song she already had a concept for and experiment with sounds that were different from what she was working on with her album. Holkenborg had composed the score for the film; the writers decided to take the orchestrations he created and use them in the song. The production was handled by Mattman & Robin.\nMusically, \"Swan Song\" is an electropop track. It is constructed in verse\u2013chorus form and composed in the time signature of  time in the key of C minor, with a tempo of 96 beats per minute and a chord progression of A\u266d\u2013B\u266d\u2013Cm\u2013Gm7. The song begins with a burst of horns and heavy drums. The production features muted electronics, airy synths, stabbing brass samples, vocal chants, percolating percussion, cinematic horns, orchestral stabs, a driving melody, powerful strings and a mechanized, cybernetic and pulsating beat. Lipa builds on an urgency feeling in the bridge. The synths build up to the minimal chorus, while the sections progress to the final booming hook.\nLipa uses triumphant vocals, ranging from G\u2083 to D\u2085. In the song, Lipa sings about new beginnings and mentions a series of obstacles she has had to overcome. The writers were inspired by how Alita fights for the lives of marginalized people. They wrote the song about how society constantly needs to speak up about what they believe in and the injustices of the world, as well as how their voices always need to be used; this message was also inspired by the film's empowering message. The song additionally took inspiration from the 1980s advocacy group ACT UP, who formed in response to the HIV/AIDS crisis at the time. The bridge paraphrases the group's motto \"silence equals death\" and the song's title"

Musically, \"Forgive Me\" is a pop track with dance influences, written in A minor. The lyrics tell the story of a girl who has found a new love and asks her old one for forgiveness. The song was written by Aliaune \"Akon\" Thiam, Claude Kelly and Giorgio Tuinfort, and produced by the former. \"Forgive Me\" was released as the fourth single of the album in the United Kingdom on 3\u00a0November 2008. The single includes the B-side \"Myself\", written by and featuring vocals of American musician Novel.\nIn \"Forgive Me\", music critics compared Lewis's vocals with that of Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. The music video was directed by Wayne Isham, and it was inspired by multiple Broadway musicals, including Carousel and West Side Story. \"Forgive Me\" reached number five on the British and Irish charts, thus becoming Lewis's fourth single to peak within the top ten in the UK. Additionally, it peaked atop the Slovakian Singles Chart and reached the top ten in Italy and Sweden. \nLewis promoted \"Forgive Me\" on some television shows, such as GMTV and The National Lottery Live, in the United Kingdom, as well as on the Italian television show Carr\u00e0mba! Che sorpresa and on the Swedish talent show Idol. Also, the song was added to the setlists of her tours The Labyrinth (2010) and Glassheart (2013).\n\"Forgive Me\" was written by Claude Kelly, Giorgio Tuinfort and Aliaune \"Akon\" Thiam, and produced by the latter. The single was published with one B-side, \"Myself\", written by Justin E. Boykin, Graham N. Marsh, Lewis and Alonzo \"Novel\" Stevenson.\n\"Forgive Me\" is described as a \"funky pop song\", written in A minor. According to the sheet music published by Sony BMG, it moves at 120 beats per minute and is set in common time. On it, Lewis performs her highest pitch (G\u2085) in falsetto during the final chorus, and her lowest pitch (A\u2083) during each verse. \n\"Forgive Me\" describes a female protagonist in a one-sided relationship who leaves her boyfriend and eventually finds someone to reciprocate her love. Though she has found love from someone else, she defends herself and asks her ex-boyfriend for forgiveness. In an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis explained why she decided to change her musical genre from her previous singles to a more upbeat one. She said: \"I wanted to do something a bit different and the chance to work with Akon came about. I'm really pleased with how it's turned out and it's great that it's different, rather than what I always do.\" There are two versions of the song, the \"album version\" (3:40) and the \"single mix\" (3:24).\nOn 26 July 2008, the single mix was released to the Mexican iTunes Store as a stand-alone digital single. For the UK release, the single cover was revealed on 17\u00a0September 2008, whilst the song was released in the UK on 3\u00a0November 2008 as the fourth single. Originally, the song was featured only in the North American version of the album Spirit, launched in April\u00a02008. Later, \"Forgive Me\" was added in the deluxe edition of the album, which was released internationally in November\u00a02008.\nLewis performed the song on the television programmes The National Lottery Live on 29\u00a0October 2008, and GMTV on 31\u00a0October 2008. Outside of the UK, she also performed the song on the Italian television show Carr\u00e0mba! Che sorpresa and on the Swedish talent show Idol. In May\u00a02010, the song was added to the setlist of her tour The Labyrinth, performed as the eighth song of the show. A live performance from The O2 Arena was included on the live album's DVD The Labyrinth Tour Live from The O2. In 2013, Lewis added \"Forgive Me\" to the setlist of her Glassheart Tour.\n\"Forgive Me\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. CBBC's Newsround described \"Forgive Me\" as a danceable song. Gavin Martin of The Mirror gave the song three-out-of-five points and said, \"[the song] showcases her voice of fire and honey. No apologies necessary\". Nick Levine, Digital Spy music"

It was written and produced by Max Martin and Rami. The song was released on December 10, 2001, by Jive Records, as the second single from Britney. \"Overprotected\" is a dance-pop song that is about a girl who is tired of being overprotected and just wants to be herself. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. It was released to United States radio in a remixed R&B form by Darkchild on April 1, 2002.\nWhile it did not perform well on the Billboard charts in the United States, \"Overprotected\" peaked at number 22 in Canada, while reaching the top five in Italy, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom. An accompanying music video, directed by Billie Woodruff, portrays Spears dancing inside an abandoned factory while singing about being overprotected; the music video for \"The Darkchild Remix\", directed by Chris Applebaum, portrays Spears dancing and having fun with her friends. Spears has performed \"Overprotected\" a number of times including at the Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001\u201302) and The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004). In 2003, the song received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The song was also featured in the animated film Hotel Transylvania (2012).\nDuring the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000), Spears revealed she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound. In February 2001, Spears signed a $7\u20138 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled A Mother's Gift. On the same month, Spears started to record material for her third studio album, with \"Overprotected\" being recorded at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Additional recording was done in April 2001 at Maratone in Sweden, in which the song's vocals were completed. Background vocals were provided by Spears and Bosslady, with the track being mixed by Martin and Rami at Maratone Studios. Her third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. In an interview with the Daily Record, Spears concluded she can relate to \"Overprotected\" \"on a personal basis, because I feel kind of overprotected. When I want to go out, everything has to be organized in advance. I think that other kids of my age can relate to it to a certain extent.\"\n\"Overprotected\" is a dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and 18 seconds. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly noticed Europop influences on the song, while other critics compared it to previous songs released by Spears. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, \"Overprotected\" is composed in the key of C minor and is set in time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. Spears vocal range spans from A\u266d3 to C5.\nLyrically, the track is about a girl who is tired of being manipulated by people around her and doesn't need to be told what to do, which is perceived in lines such as \"You're gonna have to see through my perspective/ I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am/ And I don't want to be so damn protected\". Dana Alice Heller, author of Makeover television: realities remodelled (2007), said that, with \"Overprotected\", \"Spears addresses the problem of being a teen star whose personal and professional are handled by others.\" She also compared \"Overprotected\" with the singer's first reality show, Britney and Kevin: Chaotic (2005), saying that \"Britney frames her makeover as a move toward to independence, a rebellion against overly controlling parents and their stand-ins.\"\nThe song's main release in North America was a reworked R&B remix by Rodney 'Darkchild' Jerkins. Jerkins said that the label \"needed a remix that's crazy\" and that the remix has \"an old-school-type rhythm, which I think is kinda cool because it's an element [that Spears] never had, but I still gave it her edge. I was up all night rocking that joint. [It has the] same lyrics, I just reproduced the track.\" \"The Darkchild Remix\" was originally scheduled for release to radio stations in the United States in mid-March 2002; this date was pushed back and the song was released on April 1, 2002. The remix was heavily played in dance clubs, and Jerkins said he wasn't surprised with the popularity of it, stating \"[Spears] reinvented herself. Everybody"

It was then released on January 19, 2005, by Jive Records as the second single from the album outside North America. The dance-pop song features usage of electric guitars, and its lyrics allude to having a good time and not caring about other people's judgement.\n\"Do Somethin'\" received generally favorable reviews from critics, and received comparisons to Gwen Stefani's 2004 single \"What You Waiting For?\". Although the single was not released in the United States, it charted on many of Billboard's component charts due to digital downloads, managing to reach number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was also successful worldwide, reaching top ten positions in countries such as Australia, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. By the end of 2005, \"Do Somethin'\" was one of the best-selling singles in Australia and Belgium that year.\nSpears pushed Jive Records to allow her to shoot an accompanying music video for the song. The music video was co-directed by Billie Woodruff and Spears (who makes her directorial debut), and is credited as her alter ego \"Mona Lisa\", a reference to her alter ego from the song of the same name and from the scrapped Original Doll album. It portrays the singer and four female friends dancing and performing in a nightclub. Spears styled the video and came up with the choreography. The usage of a Louis Vuitton dashboard in the video resulted in a lawsuit against Jive Records in late 2007, which ended with Louis Vuitton winning \u20ac80,000 in damages. The video was also banned in all European TV channels. Spears performed \"Do Somethin'\" during The M+M's Tour in 2007, The Circus Starring Britney Spears in 2009 and Britney: Piece of Me in 2013\u201317.\nOn August 13, 2004, Spears announced through Jive Records the release of her first greatest hits compilation titled Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, due November 16, 2004. The title was chosen after the album's lead single, Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's 1988 single \"My Prerogative\". The cover was produced by Swedish production team Bloodshy & Avant, who produced her single \"Toxic\" from her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). A DVD of the same name was also released the same day, containing Spears's music videos. The track list was officially revealed on September 13, 2004. Greatest Hits: My Prerogative included three new tracks: \"My Prerogative\", \"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\" and \"Do Somethin'\", all of them produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The producers recorded and arranged the main instrumentation of \"Do Somethin'\" at Murlyn Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden. Spears recorded her vocals at Battery Studios in New York City during The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004. Background vocals were provided by Spears, Angela Hunte, BlackCell and Emma Holmgren. The song was never planned to be released as a single. However, Spears wanted to shoot a music video for the song and had to fight with her record label to do it. She explained she was \"a little disappointed\" that she had to convince them \"that making this video was the right thing to do at th[e] time\". \"Do Somethin'\" was released as the second single from Greatest Hits: My Prerogative on February 14, 2005.\n\"Do Somethin'\" is a dance-pop song with usage of electric guitars and a \"bump beat\", as described by Spence D. of IGN.

The song was written by Max, Madison Love, M\u00e5ns Wredenberg, Noonie Bao, and producers Cirkut and Lotus IV. It is a dance-pop song with lyrics about a girl being gaslighted, serving as a continuation from Max's 2018 song \"Sweet but Psycho\". The Isaac Rentz-directed music video was released on July 30, 2020, and features Max seeking revenge on her boss and cheating boyfriend.\nMax first teased \"Who's Laughing Now\" on her social media accounts on May 28, 2020, before officially announcing the single's initial June 2, 2020 release date, and cover art the next day. The release date was subsequently postponed because it coincided with Blackout Tuesday. She then announced that the song would be released on June 25, 2020, but was also indefinitely delayed on June 17, 2020. She eventually announced that it would be released on July 30, 2020. The cover art depicts a topless Max positioned in front of a flaming background. \"Who's Laughing Now\" was written by Max, Madison Love, M\u00e5ns Wredenberg, Noonie Bao, Cirkut and Lotus IV, with the latter two handling production.\n\"Who's Laughing Now\" is a dance-pop song, which contains several minor chords. Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic compared the song's island groove to artists such as Clean Bandit and Ace of Base. It was written as a continuation from her 2018 song \"Sweet but Psycho\", as the lyrics both describe a misunderstood girl being gaslighted, and serve as an analogy to Max's own experiences being rejected in the music industry. She summarized the song as \"basically telling everyone to just fuck off\". Max stated that \"Who's Laughing Now\" is targeted towards females who had bullied her throughout middle school, causing her to start home-school. The song's title was envisioned after a self-discovery revelation by Max.\nWriting for Us Weekly, Nicholas Hautman praised the chorus of \"Who's Laughing Now\", indicating that it had the catchiest \"don't cha\" since the Pussycat Dolls song \"Don't Cha\" (2005). However, Issy Sampson of The Guardian criticized the song for sounding similar to \"Sweet but Psycho\", which she described as an \"irritating earworm\". She added that the former used a \"smug\" horrible personality trait in place of \"psychotic.\"\nThe music video was directed by Isaac Rentz and released on July 30, 2020. Max is depicted as a person seeking revenge after being fired by her boss and cheated on by her boyfriend. She is seen dancing in a destroyed office and breaking a car with a crowbar, before breaking free of a psychiatric hospital while strapped in a straitjacket. Max wrote the video's plot, which she decided to incorporate several female characters into a corporate workforce dominated by men. One character portrayed by Max is gaslighted by a doctor into becoming \"psycho\", while another had musical instruments appearing from her head, which was parallel to her own negative experiences with music executives. An interactive quiz was launched as a collaboration with Spotify prior to the release of Max's debut studio album Heaven & Hell (2020). It contains 10 questions asking about personality, resulting in the choice of one of four characters portrayed in the music video; Amanda, Torrence, Carmen, and Ava.\nDigital download / Streaming\n\"Who's Laughing Now\"\u00a0\u2013  3:00\nDigital download / streaming \u2013 The Remixes\n\"Who's Laughing Now\" (Breathe Carolina Remix)\u00a0\u2013  2:24\n\"Who's Laughing Now\" (Cat Dealers Remix)\u00a0\u2013  3:40\nDigital download / streaming \u2013 The Remixes\n\"Who's Laughing Now\" (KOLIDESCOPES Remix)\u00a0\u2013  3:20\n\"Who's Laughing Now\" (COASTR.

The song was originally written and recorded in 1977 as a home demo by John Lennon, a former Beatle. In 1995, 25 years after their break-up and 15 years after Lennon's death, his surviving bandmates Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr released a studio version incorporating the demo. \nThe single was released as part of the promotion for The Beatles Anthology video documentary and the Anthology 1 compilation album. For the Anthology project, McCartney asked Lennon's widow Yoko Ono for unreleased material by Lennon to which the three remaining ex-Beatles could contribute. \"Free as a Bird\" was one of two such songs (along with \"Real Love\") for which McCartney, Harrison, and Starr contributed additional instrumentation, vocals, and arrangements. Jeff Lynne, who had worked with Harrison on Harrison's album Cloud Nine and as part of the Traveling Wilburys, co-produced.\nThe song peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 6 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also became a top-ten hit in at least 10 other countries, including Australia, Canada, Hungary and Sweden. It won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and was the Beatles' 34th top-ten single in the United States, meaning they had at least one top-forty hit in four different decades.\nThe music video was produced by Vincent Joliet and directed by Joe Pytka. Shot from the point of view of a bird in flight, it references numerous Beatles songs.\nMcCartney, Harrison and Starr originally intended to record some incidental background music, as a trio, for the Anthology project, but later realised, according to Starr, that they wanted to record \"new music\". According to Harrison, they had always agreed that if one of them was not in the band, the others would never replace them and \"... go out as the Beatles\", and that the \"only other person that could be in it was John.\"\nMcCartney then asked Ono if she had any unreleased recordings by Lennon, so she sent him cassette tapes of four songs. \"Free as a Bird\" was recorded by Lennon in 1977, in his and Ono's Dakota building apartment in New York City, but was not complete. Lennon introduced the song on the cassette by imitating a New York accent and saying, \"Free\u2014as a boid\" (bird). The other songs were \"Grow Old With Me\", \"Real Love\", and \"Now and Then\". Ono says that it was Harrison and former Beatles road manager Neil Aspinall who initially asked her about the concept of adding vocals and instrumentation to Lennon's demo tapes. Ono stated: \"People have said it was all agreed when Paul came over to New York to induct John into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but it was all settled before then. I just used that occasion to hand over the tapes personally to Paul.\"\nMcCartney went to Ono's home after the induction ceremony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to listen to, and receive, the Lennon demo tapes; he recalls the meeting with Ono:\nShe was there with Sean ... and she played us a couple of tracks. There were two newies on mono cassettes which he did at home ... [s]o I checked it out with Sean, because I didn't want him to have a problem with it. He said, \"Well, it'll be weird hearing a dead guy on lead vocal. But give it a try.\" I said to them both, \"If it doesn't work out, you can veto it.\" When I told George and Ringo I'd agreed to that they were going, \"What? What if we love it?\" It didn't come to that, luckily. I said to Yoko, \"Don't impose too many conditions on us, it's really difficult to do this, spiritually. We don't know, we may hate each other after two hours in the studio and just walk out. So don't put any conditions, it's tough enough.\"\n Ono recognised that she was now in a position of bringing the band back together after previously being criticised for splitting them up.\nDuring an interview for the Anthology project, McCartney revealed that he was surprised to learn that Lennon's demos of \"Grow Old With Me\" and \"Real Love\" had already been released and were well known by Lennon fans. Starr admitted that when he first listened to the recording he found it very emotional.\nGeorge Martin, who had produced most of the Beatles' 1960s recordings, turned down an invitation to produce \"Free as a Bird\" due to hearing problems (though he subsequently managed to produce and direct the Anthology"

It was written and produced by Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg (known collectively as Bloodshy & Avant), with additional writing by Henrik Jonback and Angela Hunte. The song was never intended to be released as a single; Spears, however, wanted to shoot a music video for it, and had to convince her record company. It was then released on January 19, 2005, by Jive Records as the second single from the album outside North America. The dance-pop song features usage of electric guitars, and its lyrics allude to having a good time and not caring about other people's judgement.\n\"Do Somethin'\" received generally favorable reviews from critics, and received comparisons to Gwen Stefani's 2004 single \"What You Waiting For?\". Although the single was not released in the United States, it charted on many of Billboard's component charts due to digital downloads, managing to reach number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was also successful worldwide, reaching top ten positions in countries such as Australia, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. By the end of 2005, \"Do Somethin'\" was one of the best-selling singles in Australia and Belgium that year.\nSpears pushed Jive Records to allow her to shoot an accompanying music video for the song. The music video was co-directed by Billie Woodruff and Spears (who makes her directorial debut), and is credited as her alter ego \"Mona Lisa\", a reference to her alter ego from the song of the same name and from the scrapped Original Doll album. It portrays the singer and four female friends dancing and performing in a nightclub. Spears styled the video and came up with the choreography. The usage of a Louis Vuitton dashboard in the video resulted in a lawsuit against Jive Records in late 2007, which ended with Louis Vuitton winning \u20ac80,000 in damages. The video was also banned in all European TV channels. Spears performed \"Do Somethin'\" during The M+M's Tour in 2007, The Circus Starring Britney Spears in 2009 and Britney: Piece of Me in 2013\u201317.\nOn August 13, 2004, Spears announced through Jive Records the release of her first greatest hits compilation titled Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, due November 16, 2004. The title was chosen after the album's lead single, Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's 1988 single \"My Prerogative\". The cover was produced by Swedish production team Bloodshy & Avant, who produced her single \"Toxic\" from her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). A DVD of the same name was also released the same day, containing Spears's music videos. The track list was officially revealed on September 13, 2004. Greatest Hits: My Prerogative included three new tracks: \"My Prerogative\", \"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\" and \"Do Somethin'\", all of them produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The producers recorded and arranged the main instrumentation of \"Do Somethin'\" at Murlyn Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden. Spears recorded her vocals at Battery Studios in New York City during The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004. Background vocals were provided by Spears, Angela Hunte, BlackCell and Emma Holmgren. The song was never planned to be released as a single. However, Spears wanted to shoot a music video for the song and had to fight with her record label to do it. She explained she was \"a little disappointed\" that she had to convince them \"that making this video was the right thing to do at th[e] time\". \"Do Somethin'\" was released as the second single from Greatest Hits: My Prerogative on February 14, 2005.\n\"Do Somethin'\" is a dance-pop song with usage of electric guitars and a \"bump beat\", as described by Spence D. of IGN.

It was released on April 10, 1985 by Sire Records as the album's third single. Written by Madonna and Steve Bray, it was one of the first songs developed for the project and, according to Madonna, was inspired by a girl who is saved by an angel, and she falls in love with him. \"Angel\" was released as a 12\" single with \"Into the Groove\" in some countries and charted likewise. A music video was planned but was canceled, and a promotional clip comprising segments of her previous videos was released in the United Kingdom.\nMusically \"Angel\" consists of three chord ascending hook, which serves for the verse and chorus. It has vocal harmonies beneath the main chorus and the lyrics repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's saviour. Critical response to the song varied, with some music critics calling it a classic and others deeming it sub-par compared to Madonna's previous singles. \"Angel\" became the singer's fifth consecutive top-five single on the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top of its dance charts. It was also able to reach number-one in Australia and the top-five of the charts in Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. Madonna has performed the song only once, on The Virgin Tour in 1985. The song was used at the soundtrack of the 3rd season of Stranger Things.\n\"Angel\" was written by Madonna and Steve Bray and released worldwide on April 10, 1985. The song first began as a demo and was recorded as early as April 1984 for her second studio album, Like a Virgin. However, the whole project was held off, much to Madonna's frustration, by the continuing sales of her self-titled debut album, which had by then sold over a million copies in United States. She had decided to release \"Angel\" as the initial single from the album, but changed her mind, after the recording of the title track \"Like a Virgin\" was complete. \"Angel\" was an ode to \"a heavenly love\" and inspired from Madonna's Catholic upbringing with the singer saying, \"I think it's important to call angels to you to protect you... That's part of the ritualistic moment. The calling of angels.\" The track was ultimately released as the third single, and included the song \"Into the Groove\", from Madonna's 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan, on the B-side of the 12-inch maxi-single.\nMadonna had initially planned to release a music video for \"Angel\", but later decided to go against it, as at that time, there were already five Madonna music videos on-rotation in the music channels and were being broadcast continuously. Hence, Warner Bros. and Madonna felt that adding another video to the already saturated channels, might not be in her favour. A promotional video, containing scenes from the music videos of \"Burning Up\", \"Borderline\", \"Lucky Star\", \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Material Girl\" was made by Warner Bros. Records and aired in the United Kingdom. The video was included on the promotional-only video compilations It's That Girl and She's Breathless.\n\"Angel\" begins with a laugh and an echo, panning from left to the right. The song is built on an ascending hook consisting of three chord sequence, which serves for the verse and chorus. It consists of a constant 8th rhythm throughout the song, making it sound similar to the songs of the band Machine. Vocal harmonies are also added beneath the main chorus. It is a two-bar phrase song, and laughter is again added as the song slowly fades out. Madonna sings in her lower register at the beginning, and shifts to the higher one in the line \"I can see it in your e-e-e-eyye-e-s\". The line was taken from the song \"Death Disco\" (1979), by the British musical group Public Image Ltd. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by Alfred Publishing, the song is set in common time, with a medium tempo of 133 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major, with Madonna's voice spanning from the  low-note of G\u266f\u2083 to the high-note of B\u266d\u2084. The song has a basic sequence of Am7\u2013Bm7\u2013Cmaj7 as its chord progression. The lyrics continuously repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's savior.\nRikky Rooksby, author of Madonna: The Complete Guide to Her Music, commented that \"Angel\" is a song \"that is less than even the sum of its parts\". Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of Madonna's Drowned Worlds: New Approaches to Her Cultural Transformations, felt that"

The dance-pop song was written by Lott in collaboration with its producers Mads Hauge and Phil Thornalley. \"Kiss the Stars\" received mainly negative reviews from contemporary critics who criticised the song's lyrics and close similarities to Katy Perry's \"Firework\" but praised its catchiness and dance-pop rhythms. The song peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe song has been accompanied by a futuristic-themed music video, which was released on 10 January 2012. The video was met with mainly positive reviews. It features Lott dancing alongside CGI robots and dancers, sporting funky hairstyles and outfits that resemble those of American recording artist Madonna. Lott has promoted the single by performing it at the Jingle Bell Ball, The National Lottery and the seventh series of Dancing on Ice.\n\"Kiss the Stars\" was written by Lott in collaboration with the track's producers Mads Hauge and Phil Thornalley. The trio previously worked together on Lott's number-one singles \"Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)\" and \"Boys and Girls\".\n\"Kiss the Stars\" has received mainly negative reviews, being criticised lyrically and for being too similar to the singles released by American singer Katy Perry. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC said that the song is essentially Perry's \"Firework\" (2010). While Ian Gittins of Virgin Media felt that the song \"apes Katy Perry down to its nudge-nudge lyrics: 'When you turn it on, I can go for hours.'\" The song was negatively reviewed by Alex Jackson of The Yorker who called it \"cheesy centric\" and \"a track one may expect at a 5 year-old's birthday party.\"\nThe track received a mixed review from Adam Berry of WhatCulture! who also felt that it evoked a style similar to Katy Perry in addition to the Vengaboys and Freezepop. He went on to criticise the song's \"dreadful\" lyrics but complimented it as \"irritatingly catchy\". Berry also predicted the track to be a \"huge\" success chartswise in the United Kingdom. \"Kiss the Stars\" was deemed as a great song with a catchy chorus and poppy rhythms by Kathryn Black of Pugwash News. Black, however, like other critics, felt that the song \"sounds like a rip-off of Katy Perry's 'Firework'.\"\n\"Kiss the Stars\" debuted at number eighty-one on the UK Singles Chart. The following week the song rose to number fourteen with sales of 18,647 units. In its third week on the chart, it rose to number eight, selling 26,983 units and becoming Lott's fifth top ten hit and ninth consecutive top 20 hit.\n\nThe music video for \"Kiss the Stars\" premiered on Lott's YouTube channel on 10 January 2012. Lott's appearance in the video has been described as a new look for her and an evolution from her previous music videos.\nThe music video features Lott donning a number of different outfits. It opens with Lott sporting a high ponytail, a black top and dark eye make-up. In the following scene, Lott is seen dancing in a tight leotard with leggings and her hair styled poker straight. In another scene, Lott wears a long blonde wig with a blunt fringe and a flowing white dress. She is also seen dancing against a futuristic background, surrounded by CGI dancers that resemble robots. In another scene, Lott kisses one of the robots, the robot then forms itself into an attractive male dancer.\nThe music video has received mainly positive reviews from contemporary critics, most likening Lott's look in it to those of pop singers such as Madonna, Lady Gaga and Kylie Minogue. According to Caroline Westbrook of Metro. Lott's long blonde ponytail and black outfit look is reminiscent of Madonna's style during ger Blond Ambition World Tour (1990). Westbrook also felt that Lott's leotard, straught bob look bears an odd resemblance to Lady Gaga. Capital FM positively reviewed the video, describing it as \"visually exciting\". The video was deemed \"a futuristic visual delight\" by 4music. Radio station In:Demand said that Lott looks \"as radiant as ever\" in the music video.\nShaun Kitchener from the website Entertainmentwise, felt that the music video was \"bizarre\" and criticised Lott for \"upping the cheese factor\" in it. The video received a mixed review from Lina Bastidas of PopDash, who like Kitchener from PopDash's sister website Entertainmentwise, felt that Lott's dance moves were \"cheesy\". Bastidas further criticised the video's \"weird\" settings but"

Like the album's title track, it was inspired by the teachings of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), more commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement. The song is an uptempo rock track with elements of blues and gospel. Some commentators have described it as the musical highpoint of Living in the Material World, with Harrison's slide guitar playing singled out as being among the finest performances of his career.\nThe composition originated during a period marked by Harrison's devotion to a Hindu-aligned ascetic life and the height of his public association with the Hare Krishna movement, which included his donation of Bhaktivedanta Manor for use as an ISKCON temple. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of the falsehood of striving for wealth or power in the material world and advocates a direct relationship with one's deity as a genuine life goal. In doing so, he belittles the role of political leaders, as well as his own status as a celebrated rock musician. The song's Krishna Conscious message was also reflected in Harrison's choice of artwork for the Material World album, specifically the reproduction of a painting from a Prabhupada-published edition of the Bhagavad Gita.\nHarrison recorded \"The Lord Loves the One\" between October 1972 and March 1973 with session musicians Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Jim Keltner and Jim Horn. While the music has invited critical praise, the devout assertions in Harrison's lyrics typified what some reviewers in 1973 viewed as an overly didactic message on much of the parent album. Among reviewers in the 21st century, the composition continues to divide opinion. Although some commentators consider it an obvious choice as a live track, Harrison performed \"The Lord Loves the One\" only once in concert \u2013 on the opening night of his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar.\nIn his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison credits the influence for \"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\" to A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishna movement. Harrison's association with ISKCON began in December 1968, when he befriended a small group of devotees that Prabhupada had sent to London to establish what became the Radha Krishna Temple. The Gaudiya Vaishnava teachings of Prabhupada, based on Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, resonated with Harrison, whose quest for an ego-less, God-conscious existence amid the false reality of Beatlemania had first taken him to India in September 1966.\nHarrison provided the devotees with financial assistance, in addition to producing their hit recording of the 5000-year-old Hare Krishna mantra, to help spread the message of Krishna Consciousness. He then met Prabhupada in England in September 1969 and was impressed by the acharya's declaration that he was merely \"the humble servant of the servant of the servant\" of the Hindu god Krishna. In line with Prabhupada's contention that the chanting of Sanskrit mantras led to a direct connection with God, Harrison adopted the practice, counting out each mantra on Hindu prayer beads stored inside a cloth bag that he wore over his shoulder.\nFurther Harrison-produced recordings by the Radha Krishna Temple followed their \"Hare Krishna Mantra\" single, culminating in an eponymous album released on Apple Records in May 1971. By that time, the devotees were regular guests at Harrison's Friar Park estate, and he subsequently bought permanent accommodation for the growing UK arm of ISKCON, at what became known as Bhaktivedanta Manor. When Prabhupada died in November 1977, he bequeathed one of the rings he was wearing to Harrison, referring to him as the Hare Krishna movement's \"archangel\".\nAuthor Dale Allison writes of the lyrical themes in \"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\": \"this song preaches karma, warns about judgment at death, and exalts love as our most important aspiration.\" Harrison wrote the song over 1971\u201372, a period of heightened devotion on his part, as well as one of frustration due to the legal and business issues afflicting his Concert for Bangladesh aid project. The idea for the composition came about after a conversation with Prabhupada, when the latter visited Harrison at Friar Park.\nThe song begins with a riff over the chords of B major and B7, which is then followed by a chorus, rather than a"

It was composed principally by Paul McCartney, with the middle eight co-written with John Lennon. The song is a love ballad with part of its lyrics sung in French.\nFollowing its inclusion on Rubber Soul, the song was released as a single in some European countries and in New Zealand, and on an EP in France, in early 1966. It was a number 1 hit for the Beatles in Belgium, France, Norway, the Netherlands and New Zealand. Concurrent recordings of the song by David and Jonathan and the Overlanders were similarly successful in North America and Britain, respectively. \"Michelle\" won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1967 and has since become one of the most widely recorded of all Beatles songs.\nThe instrumental music of \"Michelle\" originated separately from the lyrical concept. According to McCartney:\n\"Michelle\" was a tune that I'd written in Chet Atkins' finger-picking style. There is a song he did called \"Trambone\" with a repetitive top line, and he played a bass line while playing a melody.  This was an innovation for us; even though classical guitarists had played it, no rock 'n' roll guitarists had played it. The first person we knew to use finger-picking style was Chet Atkins ... I never learned it. But based on Atkins' \"Trambone\", I wanted to write something with a melody and a bass line in it, so I did. I just had it as an instrumental in C.\nThe words and style of \"Michelle\" have their origins in the popularity of Parisian Left Bank culture during McCartney's Liverpool days. In his description, \"it was at the time of people like Juliette Greco, the French bohemian thing.\" McCartney had gone to a party of art students where a student with a goatee and a striped T-shirt was singing a French song. He soon wrote a farcical imitation to entertain his friends that involved French-sounding groaning instead of real words. The song remained a party piece until 1965, when John Lennon suggested he rework it into a proper song for inclusion on Rubber Soul.\nMcCartney asked Jan Vaughan, a French teacher and the wife of his old friend Ivan Vaughan, to come up with a French name and a phrase that rhymed with it. McCartney said: \"It was because I'd always thought that the song sounded French that I stuck with it. I can't speak French properly so that's why I needed help in sorting out the actual words.\"\nVaughan came up with \"Michelle, ma belle\", and a few days later McCartney asked for a translation of \"these are words that go together well\", rendered incorrectly as: sont les mots qui vont tr\u00e8s bien ensemble. When McCartney played the song for Lennon, Lennon suggested the \"I love you\" bridge. Lennon was inspired by a song he heard the previous evening, Nina Simone's version of \"I Put a Spell on You\", which used the same phrase but with the emphasis on the last word, \"I love you\".\nEach version of this song has a different length. The UK mono mix is 2:33 whereas the stereo version extends to 2:40 and the US mono is 2:43. The version available in The Beatles: Rock Band has a running time of 2:50.\nThe song was initially composed in C, but was played in F on Rubber Soul (with a capo on the fifth fret). The verse opens with an F major chord (\"Michelle\" \u2013 melody note C) then the second chord (on \"ma belle\" \u2013 melody note D\u266d) is a B\u266d\u2077\u266f\u2079 (on the original demo in C, the second chord is a F\u2077\u266f\u2079). McCartney called this second chord a \"great ham-fisted jazz chord\" that was taught to them by Jim Gretty who worked at Hessey's music shop in Whitechapel, central Liverpool and which George Harrison uses (as a G\u266d\u2077\u266f\u2079) (see Dominant seventh sharp ninth chord) as the penultimate chord of his solo on \"Till There Was You\". After the E\u266d\u2076 (of \"these are words\") there follows an ascent involving different inversions of the D dim chord. These progress from A\u266ddim on \"go\" \u2013 melody note F, bass note D; to Bdim (C\u266ddim) on \"to\" \u2013 melody note A\u266d, bass note D; to Ddim on \"ge ...\" \u2013 melody note B (C\u266d) bass note B; to Bdim on ... 'ther ...\" \u2013 melody note A\u266d bass note B, till the dominant (V) chord (C major) is reached on \"well\" \u2013 melody note G bass note C.\nGeorge Martin, the Beatles' producer, recalled that he composed the melody of the guitar solo, which is heard midway through the song and again during the fadeout. He showed Harrison the notes during the recording session and then accompanied the guitarist (on piano, out of microphone range) when the solos were overdubbed. In terms of its complementary role to the main melody, musicologist Walter Everett likens this guitar part to two musical passages that Martin had"

It was released on June 9, 2014, and was made available for digital download on Amazon and iTunes on June 10. The single reached number one on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, making it the band's seventh number one single on the chart.\nIn an interview with the Pulse of Radio, and regarding how the single came together, lead singer Sully Erna revealed that it was written in about an hour, stating, \"It's one of those songs that surprisingly came out and was written from back to front in, like, an hour. I started putting one thing together with the next, and then Shannon Larkin started jumping in and then we arranged the whole song, and literally within an hour, maybe 90 minutes, this whole song was written and it was one of the last songs that we wrote, and it ended up becoming the first single.\"\nWhen interviewed by Full Metal Jackie, Erna offered additional details as how the single came to be, stating, \"We had been working on stuff that we had on our own and brought in. I go, 'You know what? We haven\u2019t wrote anything yet, I'm just going to write a song real quick before TC gets back from dinner.' Tony, kidding around, said, 'You should make it a real fast riff because he'll be right back.' So I started playing really fast and then all of a sudden, I was like, 'Hold on. I have something going here.' I started hearing the different movements in the chords and it just started to feel like it was coming together. Then all of a sudden, within 90 minutes the whole song kind of wrote itself.\"\nIn the same interview with the Pulse of Radio, Erna revealed that the working title for the single was \"100,000 Horsepower\", but he felt he needed to change it, explaining, \"Actually, the original title I wanted to put on the song was '100,000 Horsepower'. But unfortunately, rhythmically, it was too many syllables and I couldn't make it fit the way I wanted to creatively, so I trimmed it back to '1000 Horsepower', which is still pretty fuckin' powerful, by the way.\"\nDigital single\nOn August 12, the music video for 1000hp premiered on Shazam, a commercial smartphone-based music identification service. One day later, it premiered on Godsmack's official Vevo channel.\nOn August 4, Godsmack took the stage at the iHeartRadio Theater in New York City as part of the iHeartRadio Live Series for an intimate live performance. The show, which was streamed online, saw the band perform 1000hp live for the first time.\n\nARTISTdirect reviewer Rick Florino gave the song a favorable review and described it as a \"bombastic Boston bruiser of epic proportions\" and that \"all of the hallmarks of the band's patented sound remain intact.\" Florino concluded his review by saying, \"It's the kind of tune you could hear at sports events and during high-octane action movie set pieces for years to come. It's exactly how real rock should sound in 2014, and it's one of the best singles of the year.\" A less favorable review came from Shelly Barclay of AXS, who felt that the song was not on a par with the band's other singles, stating, \"The song does not have the same guttural edge as songs like 'Keep Away'.\" However, she went on to say that the song \"holds its own in the band's library of rock tunes.\"\nUpon its release, \"1000hp\" entered both the Billboard Mainstream Rock and Hot Rock Songs charts, peaking at number one and twenty-two, respectively. \"1000hp\" also debuted at number one on the U.S. iTunes Rock Chart.\n\n\n\nGodsmack\nSully Erna \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, producer\nTony Rombola \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals\nRobbie Merrill \u2013 bass guitar\nShannon Larkin \u2013 drums, percussion\nTechnical personnel\nDave Fortman \u2013 production, mixing\n\"Godsmack: '1000hp' Single Premiere\".

The song was originally released as a limited edition \"Club Mix\" in December 1990 with Pete Wylie on vocals. A re-recorded version with Bill Drummond on vocals was released commercially in October 1991. These recordings were the first releases by Drummond and his creative partner Jimmy Cauty under the JAMs moniker since the 1988 compilation album Shag Times, and the last under that name; in the meantime they had operated as the Timelords and the KLF. The 1991 single release reached No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart and entered the top 10 in Denmark and Finland.\nThe lyrics to \"It's Grim Up North\" list towns and cities in the North of England, set to a pounding industrial techno beat and percussion reminiscent of steam whistles. The 1991 version segues into an orchestral instrumental of the hymn \"Jerusalem\". A recurring theme of \"It's Grim Up North\" was drab greyness, representing the dreary, overcast skies of the \"grim\" North. The original single featuring Pete Wylie was pressed on grey vinyl, and the same colour was retained for the sleeve of the 1991 release. The video for \"It's Grim Up North\" was filmed in black and white, and shows The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu performing in the pouring rain.\n\"It's Grim Up North\" was planned to be a prominent track on the JAM's album The Black Room, but the album was never completed.\nMusic-industry figure Bill Drummond and artist/musician Jimmy Cauty began recording together in 1987 as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (also known as The JAMs), naming themselves after the fictional conspiratorial group \"The Justified Ancients of Mummu\" from The Illuminatus! Trilogy. In 1988 they had their first UK number one hit single - Doctorin' the Tardis - as The Timelords, after which they transitioned into The KLF. \"It's Grim Up North\" was released commercially by the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu in 1991, in the middle of a run of upbeat house records by the KLF which would see Cauty and Drummond become the biggest-selling singles act in the world that year.\n\"It's Grim Up North\", with its markedly darker tone than the KLF records, was planned to be a prominent track on the ultimately unreleased album The Black Room, an album which Cauty said would be \"so heavy it will just pin you to the floor\" and which Drummond said would be the \"yang to the yin\" of The White Room, released in March 1991.\nA recurring theme of \"It's Grim Up North\" was drab greyness, representing the dreary, overcast skies of the \"grim\" North.

The video for \"It's Grim Up North\" was filmed in black and white, and shows The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu performing in the pouring rain. King Boy D (Drummond) voices the words into the microphone of a backpack field radio worn by a woman at his side wearing military uniform and a helmet labelled \"KLF\". Rockman Rock (Cauty) is shown playing bass guitar as well as an unnamed drummer in the background wearing a hoodie. Cars and trucks rush by, leaving a trail of spray because evidently The JAMs are performing on one lane of a road; they are lit by the headlights of several nearby stationary vehicles. As the performance draws to a close, and the strains of Jerusalem can be heard, the slogan \"The North will rise again\" appears on screen.\nThe sleevenotes further elaborated on The JAMs' inspiration: \"Through the downpour and diesel roar, Rockman and Kingboy D can feel a regular dull thud. Whether this is the eternal echo of a Victorian steam driven revolution or the turbo kick of a distant Northern rave is irrelevant. Thus inspired, The JAMS climb into the back of their truck and work.\"\n\"It's Grim Up North (Part 1)\" is a 10-minute composition with two distinct segueing sections. The seven-minute first section is a heavy, pounding industrial techno track, over which Drummond lists the names of some towns and cities in the North of England. Between verses, Drummond's distorted voice urgently alerts us that \"It's grim up north\". The instrumentation is in a minor key and is frequently discordant, featuring synthesised sounds reminiscent of passing heavy goods vehicles and train whistles. Although the underlying rhythm keeps a 4/4 time signature, several instruments keep 3/16 and 3/4 time throughout the track, including a deep second drum line\u2014the \"regular dull thud\"\u2014which juxtaposes when the 4/4 instruments and percussion drop out.

Written by the group members, together with Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard during the group's first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album Spice (1996).\n\"2 Become 1\" is a pop ballad that features instrumentation from a guitar, an electronic keyboard and string instruments. The lyrics focus on the bonding of two lovers, and also address the importance of contraception. Its Big TV!-directed music video, which features the group performing against time-lapse footage of Times Square in New York City, was completely shot against a green screen at a studio in London. The backdrop was later superimposed.\nReleased as the group's third single on 16 December 1996, it was generally well received by music critics and was a commercial success. It topped the UK Singles Chart for three weeks, becoming the group's third consecutive chart-topper, their second million-selling single, and their first Christmas number-one single in the United Kingdom. In July 1997, the song was released in the United States, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100, and receiving a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It performed similarly internationally, peaking inside the top ten on the majority of the charts that it entered. The song was named \"Song of the Year\" at the 1998 ASCAP London Music Awards.\nIn 2019, Emma Bunton covered the song, as a duet, with Robbie Williams on her fourth solo album, My Happy Place.\nIn December 1994, the Spice Girls persuaded their former managers\u2014father-and-son team Bob and Chris Herbert\u2014to set up a showcase in front of industry writers, producers and A&R men at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush, London. Producer Richard Stannard was originally at the studio to meet pop star Jason Donovan, but he ended up in the showcase after hearing Melanie Brown, as she went charging across the corridor. Stannard recalls:\nMore than anything, they just made me laugh. I couldn't believe I'd walked into this situation. You didn't care if they were in time with the dance steps or whether one was overweight or one wasn't as good as the others. It was something more. It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.\nStannard stayed after everyone had left the showcase to talk to the group, he then reported back to his songwriter partner Matt Rowe, that he had found the pop group of their dreams. In January 1995, Chris Herbert booked the group's first professional songwriting session with the producers at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, East London. Rowe remember feeling similarly to Stannard when he first met the group, \"I love them. Immediately. [...] They were like no one I'd met before, really.\" The session was productive as the duo seemed to get along with the group, together they discussed about the songwriting process and what they wanted to do with the record. In her autobiography, Brown recalled that the duo instinctively understood their point of view and knew how to incorporate \"the spirit of five loud girls into great pop music\".\n\"2 Become 1\" was co-written by the Spice Girls along with partners Richard Stannard and Matthew Rowe. Stannard and Rowe also co-produced the track. After writing more uptempo dance-based songs, such as \"Wannabe\", the group and the two producers decided to write a slow ballad. But as the group were writing the song, they realised that it was a bit too slushy, so it was decided to address the importance of contraception with the lyrics: \"Be a little bit wiser baby. Put it on, put it on\".\nThe song was inspired by the \"special relationship\" that was developing between Geri Halliwell and Rowe. Brown hinted at this development in her autobiography commenting: \"When he [Rowe] and Geri started making eyes at each other I knew what was going on, even though they denied it. I knew them both too well for it to be a secret for me.\" Stannard commented about the fondness between Halliwell and Rowe: \"I don't want to get into the side of things. They were very close. They clicked. And I think the lyrics in '2 Become 1' came from that, especially the first verse, which they wrote together.\"\nThe group recorded a European Spanish version of the song, written by them, Rowe, Stannard, and N. Ma\u00f1o. The title was \"2 Become 1\" (Spanish Version),"

It features a distorted electric guitar sound.\nWebsite Digital Spy commented on the song saying: \"'Don't Tell Me That It's Over' is a glossier, rockier effort laced with strings that wouldn't shame a stadium-filler from Take That or Coldplay. As ever though, it's Macdonald's knack for a proper pop chorus and that irresistible Gaelic lilt that catch your ear, and her pointed lyrics that hold it. \"Tell me what I'm meant to see, why are you preaching at me?\" she asks popstars with A Worthy Cause fetish. Oh Bono, are you listening?\"\nMacdonald began writing songs for her second album in spring 2009, in a brief break from her touring commitments. For the first time she began poring through her old notebooks, looking at song ideas, unlike her debut which consists mainly of songs that she wrote straight away. Many of the tracks were inspired by real-life personalities or events from her daily life. The tracks were recorded at Weller's BlackBarn Studios in Surrey.\n\n\n\n\nThe music video shows Macdonald singing and playing the guitar in a kind of band room. The video also features scenes from nature and city life.\n\n\n\nMixed By - Bob Clearmountain\nProducer, Arranged By - Pete Wilkinson\nWritten-By, Vocals, Guitar - Amy Macdonald\nBacking Vocals - Sarah Erasmus\nBass Guitar - Ben Sargeant\nCello - Ann Lines\nDrums - Adam Falkner\nElectric Guitar - Jolyon Dixon\nEngineer [Balance] - Jo Miflin\nEngineer [Mastering] - Dick Beetham\nEngineer [Pro-tools] - Mo Hausler\nExecutive Producer - Paul Adam\nGuitar - Mark Kulke\nKeyboards - Shannon Harris\nMixed By - Danton Supple\nPhotography - Nicky Emmerson\nProducer - Paul Long\nProducer [Additional], Engineer - Joe Fields\nProducer, Arranged By, Arranged By [Strings], Arranged By [Keyboards], Arranged By [Piano] - Pete Wilkinson\nViola - Peter Lale (tracks: 1), Susan Dench\nViolin - Chris Tumbling, Jonathan Hill, Laura Melhuish, Leo Payne\nVocals, Acoustic Guitar - Amy Macdonald\nWritten-By - Amy Macdonald, Paul Weller\n\"Official German homepage\".

It was released alongside the official music video on September 18, 2020, as the lead single off Bieber's sixth studio album, Justice. The single marks the pair's fifth collaboration following \"Confident\" (2013), \"Juke Jam\" (2016) and featured appearances on \"I'm the One\" (2017) and \"No Brainer\" (2018). \"Holy\" is a pop song with elements of gospel. Billboard named it the 41st best song of 2020. The acoustic version was released on November 6, 2020.\nThe official video was released on September 18, 2020, and features Bieber as a laid-off oil worker and his partner being helped by a charitable soldier.\nBieber's fifth studio album Changes was released on Valentine's day, the 14th of February 2020. On September 15, 2020, Bieber tweeted that his new single \"Holy\" would be released in a few days to signify his next musical \"era\". Lyrically, the song is about Bieber's love for his wife Hailey Bieber and his love of God. \"Holy\" discusses themes of loyalty and faith, with The New York Times calling it \"devotional R&B\".\nBieber and Chance had previously worked on several songs together, with \"Holy\" marking their fifth collaboration. In terms of the lyrical content, both Bieber and Chance are Christians as well as songwriter Jon Bellion.\nJon Bellion earlier performed it at a VIP concert event saying that it will be released later in the year. Bellion's fans would begin to beg for it and eventually get it released by Bieber and Chance The Rapper, whom Jon would work with knowing they would reach a broader audience and more ears overall.\n\"Holy\" is a pop song, composed in G-flat major with a tempo of 88 beats per minute.\nBieber performed a live version of the song on Saturday Night Live on October 17, 2020. He performed the song again at the 2020 People's Choice Awards in November.\nThe acoustic version of the song was released on November 6.\nA charity version of the song was released on December 18. This version featured the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir, who had got to the top of the UK Christmas singles chart in 2015 with their charity release \"A Bridge over You\", a chart which saw Bieber at number two with \"Love Yourself\". \"Holy\" was an early contender for the 2020 UK Christmas number one in the UK. However, when the new version was released on 18 December 2020, it still had a credit for Chance the Rapper, like the original version which first entered the UK chart on 25 September 2020. As the new record was seen as just a remix, \"Holy\" ended up at Number 41 in the Christmas chart with 17,594 sales, after being classed as per the original release with a lower chart ratio.\nNME rated the song 3/5 stars, and drew similarities to Kanye West's gospel music. Stereogum criticized the song's bland lyrics and execution, writing, \"Being madly in love with your spouse is good; it\u2019s just that the Justin Bieber songs about being madly in love with your spouse are bad.\"\n\n\"Holy\" debuted at number one on the Canadian Hot 100 issued for October\u00a03, 2020. Music Canada certified the song 2\u00d7 Platinum. On the US Billboard Hot 100, it debuted and peaked at number three; it earned a Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which denotes one million units based on sales and track-equivalent on-demand streams. \"Holy\" reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart, and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it Gold. In Australia, the song charted at number four and went 2\u00d7 Platinum. It peaked at number two in New Zealand and received a Platinum certification. \"Holy\" reached the top 10 of national record charts, at number two in Ireland, number three in the Netherlands, Norway, number five in Singapore, Sweden, number six in the Czech Republic, Malaysia, number seven in Denmark, number eight in Poland, number nine in Scotland, and number 10 in Austria, Hungary, Switzerland. The song received a Gold certification in Belgium, Norway.\nThe music video for \"Holy\" was released the same day as the song, September 18, 2020. It was directed by Colin Tilley and stars Wilmer Valderrama and Ryan Destiny. The video follows Bieber, a recently laid off oil worker, and Destiny as a couple who meet a helpful soldier played by Valderrama. The video has been interpreted as a commentary on the Just Transition. As of January 14, 2021, the"

It is the second single from his third studio album Graffiti, released as a digital download on November 24, 2009. The song was produced by The Messengers and was written by Brown. The song is about yearning to rebuild a failed relationship and was interpreted by critics as being about Brown's former relationship with Barbadian singer Rihanna. However, Brown has stated the song is not about any of his previous relationships.\nThe song received positive to mixed reviews. It charted in the top twenty in Japan and New Zealand, and the top forty in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It peaked in the United States at number fifty-three. The accompanying music video features Brown and American R&B singer Cassie as his love interest. In the video, he yearns for their relationship on a winter night in a city and in a desert scene. Brown performed the song on his 2009 Fan Appreciation Tour, and on BET's SOS: Help for Haiti Telethon, which benefited victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\nThe song was leaked to internet on October 21, 2009, one day after ex-girlfriend Rihanna's ballad \"Russian Roulette\" was also leaked. The song, which has been described as \"melancholy\", sees Brown singing about a relationship that has slipped out of his hands with its chorus calling for an \"incremental reconciliation\" of the unspecified relationship. Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News noted that both \"Crawl\" and Rihanna's \"Russian Roulette\" would inevitably be interpreted as being about Brown and Rihanna's relationship.\nIn an interview with MTV News, Brown stated that the song is not about Rihanna or any of his previous relationships. He called the message of the song \"universal\", and not just about love but \"any type of heartache.\" About the track he said, \"When I heard the whole concept and everything I was like, 'Yo, this is crazy. So being able to express the feelings, it was like, probably one of the best [records I've done.] But it was more than me trying to do a record that meant crawl to love, crawl back to love. Meaning whether it's from your negative situations, whether it's from any problems you've dealt with, like anybody's situation.\" Although he stated his concept for the song was about love, he said for anybody, the song could be \"inspired as far it being the war or a death in the family, whether it's anything, anybody just crawl back to love.\"\nThe music video was edited by David Blackburn and directed by Joseph Kahn, who also worked with Brown on the \"I Can Transform Ya\" and \"Forever\" videos. The video features American R&B singer Cassie as Brown's love interest. Kahn had previously directed the video for Britney Spears's 2008 'comeback' song, \"Womanizer\", after her public breakdown. In an interview with MTV News, Kahn said, \"I seem to be the guy that record companies go to when they need help,\" he joked. \"I truly feel [Brown] is remorseful. You don't drop people just because they made a mistake (even if it was a big mistake).\"\nKahn said that the entire idea for the video was Brown's: \"It's an interesting video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically told me a story of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I fell in love with the idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper.\" When comparing the song's video to that of \"I Can Transform Ya\", the director said, \"'Crawl' is my favorite one, because \u2014 gosh, I'm going to let you in on this \u2014 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done.\" He went on to say, \"I mean, everything that's happened to him in the year, I think this is going to be his big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now.\" When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn said that the video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the \"genesis\" of what that idea was.\nOn November 2, 2009, several stills from the video were released onto the internet. The photos focused on two sets of the video, a desert location, and a snow and puddle-spotted alleyway. In both settings, Brown wears the same thick black glasses, brown leather trench coat, white T-shirt, and fingerless gloves, among other attire. Cassie appears in a photo from the alleyway scenes, as the desert scenes show Brown in \"deep contemplation\". The video first aired"

Before its official single release, the song was first released to digital retailers in certain territories on November 2, 2007, through Zomba Recordings, as a promotional single. More than a month later, on December 4, 2007, Jive Records and Zomba Recordings serviced the song to rhythmic crossover radio in the United States. They later solicited to contemporary hit radio on January 8, 2008. On March 4, 2008, an extended play for \"With You\" was released to digital retailers in certain countries, including the United States, featuring the original song and two other remixes by Tracy Young and Kovas. Another extended play was released in selected countries on March 14, 2008, containing the original version and four other remixes. On March 21, 2008, \"With You\" was released as a digital single in several countries, including Belgium, France, Ireland and Norway. The single featured a B-side, the B&B Remix of \"With You\".\n\"With You\" is a \"folksy\" R&B song. According to the music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, \"With You\" utilizes styles of urban and contemporary R&B music and has a moderate tempo of 86 beats per minute. It is written in a key of E\u266d major while Brown's vocals range from E\u266d\u2084 to B\u266d\u2085 The song follows a basic sequence of E\u266d5-E\u266dmaj7-A\u266d7-B\u266d as its chord progression. It consists of a slow stuttering drum beat and an acoustic guitar arrangement that has garnered comparisons to that present in Stargate's other produced song, Beyonc\u00e9's 2006 hit \"Irreplaceable\". Kelefa Sanneh of New York Times said the song could be a cover of \"Irreplaceable\", while Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the two songs \"kissing cousins\". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that the song \"openly mimics \"Irreplaceable\" right down to the acoustic guitar riff.\"  Lyrically, \"With You\" is written about teenage love, presented in the lyrics \"And now I know I can\u2019t be the only one/ I bet there\u2019s hearts all over the world tonight / With the love in their life who feel the way I feel when I\u2019m with you.\"\nThe music video was shot in Los Angeles, California on November 20, 2007. It premiered on music video channels MTV, BET, and Fuse TV during the week of December 3, 2007. In a November 8, 2007, interview with MTV, Brown stated that he co-directed the video as well. \"And it shows me more solo. Like, it shows the grown side of Chris \u2013 it doesn't show the kiddie side. 'Cause with this album, I wanted to blend, I wanted to do all different visuals of me. The first [video] 'Wall to Wall,' the acting, the vampires, the spookiness, then you go to 'Kiss, Kiss,' that had the little goofy part, now this one is solo, the main [performer] is me. Me freestyle dancing \u2013 just showing people me naturally, not a choreographed"

The song was produced by Mike 'Scribz' Riley and written by Misha B and Talay Riley. The song fuses R&B with dub step, reggae, pop, drum & bass elements, whilst also sampling the hook from The Fugees' 1996 single \"Fu-Gee-La\", which itself is based on Teena Marie's 1988 hit \"Ooo La La La\".\nThe single was featured on Digital Spy's 10 tracks you need to hear Playlist. So So Gay listed it on their Singles of the Week.\n\n\"Here's to Everything\" was written by Misha B and Talay Riley and produced by Scribz Riley. According to Misha, the concept of the track is \"here's to all the lows that make beautiful highs\". On sampling, she revealed that Lauryn Hill is one of her musical inspirations; \"I had to be cautious, she's one of my inspirations.\"\nIn an interview with on BBC 1xtra Misha B informed CJ Beatz that from the age of nine she had always wanted to produce a song about \"what life meant to me\", to \"write a song entitled or just surrounding the concept here\u2019s to everything\"; the track is a \"toast to life! It\u2019s a feel good song celebrating everything life throws at you. I loved making it and had been waiting to write a song like this for ages. Here it is! Here\u2019s to everything!\".\nSoul Culture noted that \"the upbeat single\" was fused R&B with reggae, pop, drum & bass elements, while Digital Spy mentioned \"bouncy drums that burst on the drum 'n' bass-pop chorus\". Misha B described the sound of the track as \"dub step infused with a splash reggae and dance\", with \"a dancey reggae style which I hope will get everyone dancing. Reggae is a style close to my heart, and I love to draw on my Jamaican roots. So Drums and rhythm are a real priority to me.\"\nOn 8 February 2013, Misha B announced that \"Here's to Everything (Ooh La La)\" would be released as the third single from her forthcoming debut album. On 15 February 2013, the song received its worldwide premier on The Hits Radio. On 19 March 2013, the artwork was released.\nThe single has had mixed reviews. 4music wrote a positive review, commenting, \"With lyrics like Dee Dee Dee Dee Dum and Ooh La La, the song is lighthearted, optimistic and is sure to put you in a good mood.\" Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave the song 3 out of 5 stars in a mixed-to-positive review saying that \"The sentiment may not be the most original, but come summer, we'll no doubt find ourselves raising a glass or two, or three...\" Mark Blankenship of NewNowNext.com wrote a positive review calling it  \"a heart-exploding command to dance your ass off and have a good time.\" Sarah Dean writing for Huffingtonpost called the track \"perfect happy music\" and regarded it as the closest the UK is going to get to a Nicki Minaj hit at the moment. EQ Music Blog reviewed it as an upbeat tune and a \"monster swaggering anthem set by a drum and bass beat... It\u2019s going to make you bump, bump, your hump, hump resolutely in happiness at it\u2019s [sic] every which way, crash and bang burst of positivity.\" Greg White of So So Gay labelled the single as \"a booming, drum n bass, pop number that\u2019s obviously vying to be a song of the summer.\"  Whilst noting that the track was \"slick and well-crafted\", he didn't find the song catchy and labelled it generic. He also expressed that it was too similar to Rihanna's sound and that Misha B tried too hard to flavour the track with a thick island accent. He continued to say that her signature \"powerful and heartfelt\" vocals were not present and labelled the lyrics as \"extremely common\" and lacking personality. Paul Leake of ClickMusic.com stated that with each single release she delivers a \"quality far above the norm for an X Factor alum.\" He went on to praise the track, which shows off \"both her talent as a pop artist and her musical influences, occasionally colliding with mixed results\". However, he thought the sampling felt \"more calculated than shrewd\".\nMisha B performed this song live on Blue Peter. She also performed acoustic versions for several music sites including grammy.com, the Virgin Red Room (Virgin Group), Kiss 100 London, Shazam.com and Planet Notion.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Here's To Everything (Ooh La La)\" debuted on the UK R&B Chart at number 7 on 5 May 2013. It also entered the UK Singles Chart at number 35 in the same week, but did not stay in the top 40.\n\nThe music video was directed by Justin Dickel and produced by Alex Bedford, and was filmed from 24 to 26 February 2013.

Written by Alexander Kronlund and Lukas Hilbert with production from Hilbert and James Reynolds, the song was released as the EP's lead single on 8 August 2010 as a digital download and on 9 August as a CD single. The lyrics centre on being in a relationship where the passion has died, but still being addicted to the love that used to exist. It features an electropop production, incorporating elements of synthpop. The group described the song as \"an updated version of their sound\" and was fun to record and experiment with. \"Missing You\" is more out-there than that rest of \"Headlines!\".\nThe single received negative reviews from music critics, who criticised the auto-tuned vocals and the song's production, which lacked energy. An accompanying music video features scenes of the group dancing on a beach in M\u00e1laga, Spain. It peaked at number six on the Irish Singles Chart and number three on the UK Singles Chart, beaten by Flo Rida's \"Club Can't Handle Me\" feat. David Guetta and Eminem's \"Love the Way You Lie\" feat. Rihanna. It was the second time that the group had lost out to Flo Rida in chart battle although it is their fourth top-ten hit in Ireland and seventh in the UK. The official remix features British grime artist, rapper and songwriter Professor Green.\n\"Missing You\" is an electropop song incorporating elements of trance and synthpop. It was written by Lukas Hilbert and Alexander Kronlund. According to the group \"it's about being in a relationship where the passion has gone \u2013 so you're missing that spark. It's quite deep, actually, for a pop song.\" The critics also agreed, calling the lyrics \"surprisingly dark\". It has also been described as \"experimental\" and an \"updated version\" of their previous sound. The production was described as \"pretty\" but \"limp\" as the \"melody is traded for a random 'miss, missing you' refrain\". Some of the group also make use of Auto-Tune on their vocals, mainly Frankie Sandford, whilst Mollie King uses the natural croak in her voice and Vanessa White's vocals had a nasal tone. White sings lead vocals on the first chorus, Healy sings lead vocals on the second chorus and Wiseman sings lead vocals on the third and final chorus.\n\"Missing You\" received generally negative reviews from music critics. Tony Falls of Virgin Media was highly critical of the song, awarding it zero out of ten. \"Never have a group got by with so little a contribution to music, but so big a contribution to rolling back feminist progress. 'Missing You' sounds like an album track. Not something you\u2019d hear as a comeback track that would uplift your lost consciousness about the girls\u2019 disappearance. The idea of shooting the video in Spain for this type of song is a nice choice, but Frankie is overly tanned. Please kill me. A vacuous set of reviews for a vacuous group of girls.\"\nFraser McAlpine gave the song a mixed review, awarding it three out of five stars. He pointed out that fans of the group would be divided on the song. \"Something hidden deep in the song's DNA is engagingly bad, or worryingly good, and it's got everyone's quality alarms jangling like a wind-chime in a hurricane ... [There is a moment of] appreciation for the bit where they sing \"begging to get back together\" ... It's slow, moody, ponderous, a little bit boring at times, but when it gets to that bit, it's ... the good bit.\" He also called the song a \"grower\" Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review saying, \"'Missing You' is a post-break-up song with a modishly rave-tinged production... and after a few spins the chorus wiggles into your brain like a tapeworm that missed the turning marked 'digestive tract' ... The charts? Sorted. Your hearts? Well, that's a matter of personal preference of course, but, the odd rocky patch excepted, they've had ours since 'Up'.\"\nUpon digital release the single debuted in Ireland at number forty-two. Then upon CD release, \"Missing You\" became the group's fourth top-ten hit by peaking at number six. It is the group's joint-best charting single in Ireland and the second single to chart at number six, after \"Just Can't Get Enough\" reached the same position back in March 2009. On 14 August 2010, the single"

Both the film and the soundtrack were abandoned in 1989, due to spiralling costs and the commercial failure of the soundtrack single \"Kylie Said to Jason\".  However, much of the musical material was salvaged and substantially remodelled to form the basis of their later, commercially successful work.  In particular, bootlegged copies of \"Go to Sleep\" reveal many chord sequences and melodies later used in \"Last Train to Trancentral\".\nOne month prior to the \"Pure Trance\" single release, many of the same core elements were also used in ambient form during the tracks \"Wichita Lineman was a Song I Once Heard\" and \"Trancentral Lost in My Mind\" on the KLF's album Chill Out.\nThe original March 1990 12\" single constituted the third of The KLF's \"Pure Trance\" series. The sleeve, emblazoned with the number 5, reflects The KLF's prior intention that this be the fifth contribution to the series, but two titles (\"Love Trance\" and \"Turn up the Strobe\") were never released despite the sleeves having been printed.\nThe \"Pure Trance\" version of \"Last Train to Trancentral\" is a minimalist ambient house reworking of \"Go to Sleep\", stripped of the female vocals and all but one line (\"And from somewhere, I hear\") of The KLF co-founder Bill Drummond's narration.  It features a strained, chordless synthesiser melody and a progressive instrumental build-up into a string-orchestrated break.  Some parts of the track are purely percussive, punctuated by the bleats of sheep.  The track was incorporated into The KLF's February 1990 album Chill Out (most prominently on the track \"Wichita Lineman Was a Song I Once Heard\"), an album for which they have been credited as pioneers of the ambient house genre.  Indeed, upon its release, \"Last Train to Trancentral (Pure Trance version)\" was not easily categorised, with Record Mirror claiming that \"it isn't a dance track\".\nIn March 1991, a version of \"Last Train to Trancentral\" appeared on The KLF LP The White Room.  Featuring vocals by reggae musician Black Steel and a rap by Ricardo Da Force, this house reworking follows a conventional song structure, with a rhythm that mimics the sound of a train in motion along its tracks.  It uses the theme of a journey to bridge the two sides of the LP, from uptempo pop-house music to a downtempo collection of songs.\nIn April 1991, some elements of the \"LP Version\" were further reworked into a commercially minded single release.  Entitled \"Last Train to Trancentral (Live from the Lost Continent)\", this was the third and final instalment of The KLF's so-called \"Stadium House Trilogy\" of singles, following up \"What Time Is Love?\" and \"3 a.m. Eternal\" during the peak of the band's mainstream popularity. This version reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, and found top ten chart success internationally.  The track preserves the chord progression and string break of previous versions, placed in the context of a relentless, sample-filled rave arrangement.  Unlike the prior Stadium House offerings, Ricardo Da Force's rap was removed, except for \"This is what The KLF is about, also known as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, furthermore known as The JAMs...\", but the trilogy is consolidated by the presence of distinctive samples from both \"What Time Is Love?\" and \"3 a.m. Eternal\".  As with much of The KLF's output, the track is jubilant and highly self-referential, purporting that it has a message to deliver yet proceeding with deliberate ambiguity.  Also typical of The KLF, it refers to The Illuminatus! Trilogy novels and the Lost Continent of Mu.  The song features on The KLF's video The Stadium House Trilogy.\nA remix 12\" credited to The Moody Boys was released alongside the Stadium House"

It was released as soundtrack's second single in Italy and France in January 2019. The song was written by Lady Gaga, Natalie Hemby, Hillary Lindsey, and Lori McKenna, and produced by Dave Cobb and Lady Gaga.\nThe song has received widespread critical acclaim and has reached the top of the record chart in Iceland and the top ten in Belgium (both Flanders and Wallonia), Hungary, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Sweden and Switzerland, the digital charts of Luxembourg, Slovakia and the combined European chart. The track has also reached the top twenty in Denmark, Estonia, France, Malaysia, and on the digital chart of Czech Republic. It also reached the top twenty of the Australian and New Zealand charts, while achieving triple platinum certification from the former governing body.\nThe song received a nomination for Song of the Year at the 62nd Grammy Awards, the second nomination from the album in this category after \"Shallow\", which was nominated for the year before.\n\"Always Remember Us This Way\" was written by Lady Gaga, Natalie Hemby, Hillary Lindsey, and Lori McKenna, and produced by Dave Cobb and Gaga. It also features background vocals from Hemby, Lindsey and McKenna. Bradley Cooper had approached Cobb for crafting the sound of the album, after listening to the latter's work. Cobb flew out to Los Angeles and met Gaga and Cooper for a writing session. He played the track \"Maybe It's Time\" (written by singer-songwriter Jason Isbell), which impressed Gaga and Cooper and set the tone for the soundtrack. They asked Hemby, Lindsey and McKenna to come down to Los Angeles and start composing tracks.\n\"Always Remember Us This Way\" was released to Italian radios on January 4, 2019, followed by release in French radios two weeks later. A music video for the song was released previously, showing the sequence from the film when Gaga sings the track after being introduced by Jackson onstage, who sweetly tells her, \"I love you, I'll always remember us this way\". A vertical-shaped version of the clip was released to Spotify. Brooke Bajgrowicz from Billboard explained that the \"reflective video\" showed Ally and Jackson \"falling in love with each other\", while interspersed with scenes of the couple going on a motorbike ride, kissing in a parking lot and performing music together. The clip ends with the crowd chanting Ally's name, and Jackson walks over to embrace her.\n\"Always Remember Us This Way\" was recorded immediately after the songwriters finished composing it. They also provided backing vocals as Gaga recorded her vocals in the studio. Cobb said, \"It was pure magic when that went down and you can hear it in the film\u2014the energy and the excitement that was happening. It's amazing to hear that kind of voice come through headphones.\" Lindsey, who had previously collaborated with Gaga on her fifth studio album, Joanne (2016), recalled that the singer had imbibed in the character of Ally she was playing in the film completely. \"She was living in the hurt and ache of Ally losing the love of her life. We all just wanted to hug her. She was so broken up and in so much raw pain,\" Lindsey added. McKenna described the songwriting as a powerful moment because the lyrics made them all tearful, and they decided that if \"Maybe It's Time\" was Cooper's character Jackson's song, then \"Always Remember Us This Way\" belonged with Ally.\nAccording to Cobb it was magical when \"[Gaga] got in the vocal booth on the microphone and the writers were in the control room.

Following the first verse being on piano, the guitars and drums kick in from the second verse and Gaga's vocals build up to the final chorus uttering the lines, \"When the sun goes down/ And the band won't play/ I'll always remember us this way\". The song is composed in the time signature of common time and is performed in the key of A minor with a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute. It follows a chord progression of Am\u2013F\u2013C\u2013G, and the vocals span from G\u2083 to E\u2085.\nThe song received widespread critical acclaim upon release. Jon Pareles of The"

It was released as soundtrack's second single in Italy and France in January 2019. The song was written by Lady Gaga, Natalie Hemby, Hillary Lindsey, and Lori McKenna, and produced by Dave Cobb and Lady Gaga.\nThe song has received widespread critical acclaim and has reached the top of the record chart in Iceland and the top ten in Belgium (both Flanders and Wallonia), Hungary, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Sweden and Switzerland, the digital charts of Luxembourg, Slovakia and the combined European chart. The track has also reached the top twenty in Denmark, Estonia, France, Malaysia, and on the digital chart of Czech Republic. It also reached the top twenty of the Australian and New Zealand charts, while achieving triple platinum certification from the former governing body.\nThe song received a nomination for Song of the Year at the 62nd Grammy Awards, the second nomination from the album in this category after \"Shallow\", which was nominated for the year before.\n\"Always Remember Us This Way\" was written by Lady Gaga, Natalie Hemby, Hillary Lindsey, and Lori McKenna, and produced by Dave Cobb and Gaga. It also features background vocals from Hemby, Lindsey and McKenna. Bradley Cooper had approached Cobb for crafting the sound of the album, after listening to the latter's work. Cobb flew out to Los Angeles and met Gaga and Cooper for a writing session. He played the track \"Maybe It's Time\" (written by singer-songwriter Jason Isbell), which impressed Gaga and Cooper and set the tone for the soundtrack. They asked Hemby, Lindsey and McKenna to come down to Los Angeles and start composing tracks.\n\"Always Remember Us This Way\" was released to Italian radios on January 4, 2019, followed by release in French radios two weeks later. A music video for the song was released previously, showing the sequence from the film when Gaga sings the track after being introduced by Jackson onstage, who sweetly tells her, \"I love you, I'll always remember us this way\". A vertical-shaped version of the clip was released to Spotify. Brooke Bajgrowicz from Billboard explained that the \"reflective video\" showed Ally and Jackson \"falling in love with each other\", while interspersed with scenes of the couple going on a motorbike ride, kissing in a parking lot and performing music together. The clip ends with the crowd chanting Ally's name, and Jackson walks over to embrace her.\n\"Always Remember Us This Way\" was recorded immediately after the songwriters finished composing it. They also provided backing vocals as Gaga recorded her vocals in the studio. Cobb said, \"It was pure magic when that went down and you can hear it in the film\u2014the energy and the excitement that was happening. It's amazing to hear that kind of voice come through headphones.\" Lindsey, who had previously collaborated with Gaga on her fifth studio album, Joanne (2016), recalled that the singer had imbibed in the character of Ally she was playing in the film completely. \"She was living in the hurt and ache of Ally losing the love of her life. We all just wanted to hug her. She was so broken up and in so much raw pain,\" Lindsey added. McKenna described the songwriting as a powerful moment because the lyrics made them all tearful, and they decided that if \"Maybe It's Time\" was Cooper's character Jackson's song, then \"Always Remember Us This Way\" belonged with Ally.\nAccording to Cobb it was magical when \"[Gaga] got in the vocal booth on the microphone and the writers were in the control room. I was playing with the band, and it just happened. Her voice was as big as the house. All of us had goosebumps. That happens very seldomly.\" The song is a piano-driven country ballad, which is \"pushed along\" by Gaga's raw, powerful vocals.

It was released by Interscope Records on April 15, 2011 as the second single from the album. Written and produced by Lady Gaga and Nadir \"RedOne\" Khayat, it is an electro house, Dark Pop, song about a woman in love with a man who betrayed her. It embodies the incidents that have haunted Gaga in the past, and its core meaning refers to the negative parts of her life that she cannot escape. Gaga has further explained that the song was also about honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring oneself into the light. The artwork for the single was designed by Gaga in Microsoft Word. In spite of a polarizing impact on several religious groups, the song was generally well received by critics, who likened the song to \"Bad Romance\" with some noting it should have been the album's lead single.\n\"Judas\" received generally positive reviews from most music critics. The song has a similar sound to Gaga's previous RedOne-produced tracks, including \"Poker Face\", \"LoveGame\", \"Bad Romance\", and \"Alejandro\". It contains three distinct hooks and a house-influenced break down. Gaga explained that the lines spoken during the breakdown talk about her as beyond redemption, regarding the traditional views of what a woman should be.  \"Judas\" initially had a strong sales opening, but was less successful commercially in comparison to Gaga's previous singles. The song reached the top ten of the charts in most major music markets, and also reached the top of the charts in South Korea.\nA music video for the song was filmed in April 2011, co-directed by Gaga and Laurieann Gibson and co-starring Norman Reedus. It has a Biblical storyline where Reedus played Judas Iscariot and Gaga played Mary Magdalene. The video portrays them as modern day missionaries going to Jerusalem. It included the Biblical story of Judas betraying Jesus, and ended with Gaga as Magdalene getting stoned to death. Before its release, the Catholic League condemned Gaga for the use of religious imagery and her role in the video. However, the video was generally praised by critics and nominated for two awards at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. Gaga has performed \"Judas\" on a number of television shows, including The Graham Norton Show, Saturday Night Live, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Morning America's \"Summer Concert Series\", and some of her concert tours, such as the Born This Way Ball, artRAVE: The ARTPOP Ball and Las Vegas residency Enigma.\nOn May 28, 2021, a bounce cover by American rapper Big Freedia was released as the first single of the tenth anniversary edition of Born This Way.\n\"Judas\" was revealed as the name of the second single in Gaga's interview for Vogue. Gaga confirmed the release of \"Judas\" as the second single, on Ryan Seacrest's radio show on February 14, 2011, and also revealed RedOne as the co-producer of the song. At the 53rd Grammy Awards, RedOne told MTV News that if the previous single, the title track from Born This Way, polarized people, \"Judas\" was expected to shock them more. On the talk show Last Call with Carson Daly, Gaga explained to the host that \"Judas\" was about always falling in love with the wrong man over and over again. \"'Judas' is a very, very dark song. It's rad\", she added. With MSN Canada, Gaga revealed the metaphors and the meaning behind the song:\n'Judas' is a metaphor and an analogy about forgiveness and betrayal and things that haunt you in your life and how I believe that it's the darkness in your life that ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once said to me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors\u2014harder, thicker, darker\u2014and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it is a metaphor.\nGaga further elaborated on the inspiration behind the song as walking towards the light force in her life and peering towards the devil in the back, while clutching onto the source of the light. \"I sing about what a holy fool I am, and that although"

It was co-written by Joe Belmaati, Michaela Breen, Vince Clarke, Mich Hansen, Alison Moyet, John Reid, Remee and Ina Wroldsen. The song was produced by Belmaati in collaboration with Cutfather. The track samples a heavily synthesised backing rhythm from Yazoo's 1982 song \"Situation\".\n\"If This Is Love\" was first released by Fascination and Polydor Records on 27 July 2008 as the lead single from Chasing Lights. It was accompanied by a B-side entitled \"What Am I Gonna Do?\", written and produced by Duck Blackwell and Paddy Dalton. The Saturdays collaborated with Ina Wroldsen on a number of songs; eight were chosen for the album. \"If This Is Love\" was then released as the first single from it. The song has prominent electropop and dance-pop genre characteristics. It contains lyrical influences from love-hate relationships, the definition of love and its complications that can result in situations of stalking.\n\"If This Is Love\" received mainly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. On 3 August 2008, the single debuted and peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart with a total of just under 15,000 copies sold in its first week of release. It has since sold a total of 107,000 copies in the United Kingdom to-date. The single also garnered charting success for the group in Europe, where it reached number thirty-three on the European Hot 100 Singles chart.\nThe music video accompanying \"If This Love\" was directed by Harvey B. Brown and premiered on MSN Video on 16 June 2008. The video features The Saturdays in colourful dresses performing and meeting the paparazzi. \"If This Is Love\" was performed by The Saturdays as part of their setlist on The Work Tour and as supporting acts on Girls Aloud's Tangled Up Tour and Take That's Take That Present: The Circus Live Tour. The group also performed the single on various television shows, namely: Loose Women, GMTV and on Nickelodeon.\nPopjustice included the song in its list of the top hundred and four singles of 2008, ranking it at number forty-five. About.com ranked \"If This Is Love\" in their list of the best dance songs of 2008 at number twenty-eight.\n\"If This Is Love\" was written by Joe Belmaati, Mich Hansen, Vince Clarke, Alison Moyet, John Reid, Remee and Ina Wroldsen for the group\u2019s debut album Chasing Lights.\nThe track samples Yazoo's 1982 single \"Situation\" (written by Vince Clarke and Alison Moyet)  as its heavily synthesised backing rhythm, the difference between the rhythm of \"If This Is Love\" is that it is in A\u266d-tune, in comparison to the original's C\u266d-tune. The song was produced by Danish producers Joe Belmaati and Cutfather. The song features additional backing vocals from Danish singer Nabiha. Belmaati has also been credited for the keyboard and percussion instrumentation in the song, as well as for doing its engineering, mixing and programming. The song was mastered by Dick Beetham, and Graham Archer assisted in its engineering and recording.\n\"If This Is Love\" is an upbeat dance-pop, electropop, synthpop and new wave song. Its style has also been described by music critics as \"obligatory fluffy summery pop\", \"pure uplifting pop\", \"an 80's throwback\" and \"an electro-soul number\". The song has a feisty and danceable feel to it that would appeal as anthemic to the gay community. It is 3 minutes and 23 seconds in length. Written in the key of A\u266d minor, the beat is set in common time and moves at a mid-tempo 117 beats per minute. The song was constructed around a keyboard and percussion arrangement that follows an A\u266fm\u2013E\u266fm-F chord progression which forms the song's hook.\nThe vocals in the track are auto-tuned. Mollie King sings the response in the first and second verses, a backing vocal during the song's middle 8, and she opens and closes the song with a \"Yeah!\". Una Healy sings the call in the first verse as well as the bridge to the first and second choruses with Rochelle Wiseman, and some vocals after every chorus.

(2004). It was released by Polydor Records on 13 September 2004, as the second single from the album. The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Tim Powell, Nick Coler, Lisa Cowling, Myra Boyle, and Shawn Lee. The instrumentation was inspired by The Smiths, and created by Powell and Coler. \"Love Machine\" is an uptempo song with elements of 1980s synthpop. The single was received favourably by contemporary music critics, who deemed it a joyful track that was different from the single releases by other artists at the time. According to research carried out for Nokia in 2006, \"Love Machine\" is the second \"most exhilarating\" song ever.\n\"Love Machine\" debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, continuing the band's string of hits by becoming their sixth consecutive single to chart within the top three. The song also peaked inside the top ten in Europe and Ireland. The accompanying music video was directed by Stuart Gosling, and portrays the five members in a nightclub/restaurant scene dancing and sipping champagne whilst singing their song. Girls Aloud performed \"Love Machine\" on all of their tours and on several live appearances, including at Disney Channel Kids Awards, TMF Awards 2005, and at The Girls Aloud Party TV special in 2008. English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys covered the song on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.\nFollowing a brief hiatus, Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania to produce Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, following the success of their debut album Sound of the Underground. Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album. He continued, saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs, however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted. The album was recorded from April to September 2004, although its lead single \"The Show\" was released in June 2004. Bandmate Nicola Roberts said that \"Love Machine\" was recorded in 18 parts over three days. Roberts also revealed that the band initially was in disagreement with Polydor regarding its release as a single, with Sarah Harding adding that all the girls wanted to release \"Deadlines & Diets\" instead. Kimberley Walsh and Nadine Coyle in particular voiced their disapproval of the single release, Coyle stating it would be \"career suicide\" and that she thought the group would be known as laughing stocks if the song came out.\nHowever, despite an \"embarrassing\" meeting between the label and the girls, \"Love Machine\" was picked as the second single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, being released on 13 September 2004. \"The pressure to come up with singles was, as always, immense. But [...] we were able to have a lot of fun working on ideas that were maybe a little too odd to be on the radio,\" Higgins said. It was released on three different CD single formats, as well as an additional 7\" picture disc, making it Girls Aloud's first single available on vinyl. The first disc included a Flip & Fill remix of \"The Show\". For the sleeve of the second CD, Artwork design group Form invented five fake magazines, one for each member, and used \"Love Machine\" lyrics as the headlines. The disc included an exclusive previously unreleased b-side entitled \"Androgynous Girls\", which had been initially considered to be released as the lead single of the album. The Gravitas Disco Mix of \"Love Machine\" was also included. The maxi-CD also included a task-based game, created by design agency Holler. The 7\" picture disc included the radio edit and Tony Lamezma Remix of \"Love Machine\".\nCheryl Cole later stated that despite her initially hating the song, that the success of the single taught the group that they were not always right regarding single decisions and that they needed to listen to their label from time to time.\n\"Love Machine\" was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Tim Powell, Nick Coler, Lisa Cowling, Myra Boyle, Shawn Lee. They came up with some of the song's lyrics by singing \"nonsense lyrics\" over a backing track, which eventually evolved into real songwords. The instrumentation track was inspired by The Smiths, and created by Powell and Coler. It is"

The song was inspired by 1980s music and is lyrically about moving on after a heartbreak. It was released on 27 March 2020 through RCA UK as the lead single off their sixth studio album, Confetti (2020). \"Break Up Song\" peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart and charted in several other countries. It has since received gold music certifications from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and from Pro-M\u00fasica Brasil (PMB).\nLittle Mix members Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall wrote \"Break Up Song\" with Frank Nobel, and producers Kamille and Goldfingers. According to Thirlwall, they wrote the song more than a year prior to its release with 1980s pop music and an element of nostalgia in mind, similar to that of their 2015 single \"Black Magic\". Edwards, Pinnock and Thirlwall composed it during a whirl of creativity where they wrote seven songs with Kamille in one day, after having only one melody from a frustrating previous session. The track's 1980s sound stemmed from a synthesiser they dabbled with in the studio.\nA different song was initially chosen as their sixth album's lead single with an accompanying music video already filmed. However, the group opted for \"Break Up Song\" at the last minute after hearing the demo again during a playback session. The demo had only one verse and main line. Edwards described it as \"very basic at the time. The beat was all over the place and it was really, really rough - but it just had something about it.\" Thirlwall recalled, \"We got that jittery feeling that we had with \"Shout Out to My Ex\" and \"Black Magic\" where it just felt special.\"\nThirlwall described the track as \"a very feel-good kind of empowerment song about going out and just forgetting about all your woes and troubles\". It was also called an \"80s-synth pop anthem\" about \"getting over the end of a relationship\".\nA Little Mix-themed filter on Instagram was made available to the group's followers to promote the track. The song was released on 27 March 2020 and on the same day a Spotify vertical video and a lyric video were both released. The latter was made by Kayleigh, a fan of the band from the Netherlands.\nLittle Mix announced the official music video for the song on 7 May 2020 on their social media, and it was released a day later at 9am BST. The music video for the song was semi-animated, as the planned video shoot for the song had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The group filmed portions of the video at home using the original concept. The animation of the video displayed felt fabric texture to depict the band. In the video, the animated part was focused on the group hosting a Good Morning Britain-style breakfast show on a television channel called LM TV. Leigh- Anne Pinnock is presented as a news reporter, while Jesy Nelson presents the weather forecast. Perrie Edwards is presented as a fitness mentor, while Jade Thirlwall tackles the latest fashion, with each of them having their own segment in their respective verses of the song. The video also includes real-life clips of the band dancing to the song while dressed in different styles of 80's clothing.\nOn 21 August 2020, Little Mix performed \"Break Up Song\" for the first time as part of the set list for their Little Mix Uncancelled concert. The song was later performed on the eighteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing in December 2020, with member Jesy Nelson absent from the performance.\nDigital download and streaming\n\"Break Up Song\" \u2013 3:20\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 acoustic\n\"Break Up Song\" (acoustic version) \u2013 3:22\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 Nathan Dawe remix\n\"Break Up Song\" (Nathan Dawe remix) \u2013 3:21\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 Steve Void remix\n\"Break Up Song\" (Steve Void remix) \u2013 2:57\nStreaming \u2013 Break Up Song \u2013 EP\n\"Break Up Song\" \u2013 3:20\n\"Break Up Song\" (acoustic version) \u2013 3:22\n\"Break Up Song\" (Nathan Dawe remix) \u2013 3:21\n\"Break Up Song\" (Steve Void remix) \u2013 2:57\nCredits adapted from Qobuz.\nJesy Nelson\u00a0\u2013 vocals\nLeigh-Anne Pinnock\u00a0\u2013 vocals, songwriting\nJade Thirlwall\u00a0\u2013 vocals, songwriting\nPerrie Edwards\u00a0\u2013 vocals, songwriting\nKamille\u00a0\u2013 production, keyboards, vocal production, bass, background vocals\nGoldfingers\u00a0\u2013 production, drums, keyboards, programming\nRaphaella Mazaheri-Asadi\u00a0\u2013 vocal production\nFrank Nobel\u00a0\u2013 drums, keyboards,"

The track was written by the group members, Ash Howes, and its producers Richard Stannard and Tim Powell. Being the first song Little Mix wrote together as a group, it was inspired by their experiences as contestants on the eighth UK series of The X Factor and their fans. The lyrics, according to group member Jade Thirlwall, are about feeling better about yourself and making something of your life. It is a midtempo pop ballad with piano and violin accompaniment, and brief drum and bass breaks.\nThe song was released on 15 February 2013 as the album's third single to mixed reviews from music critics who complimented Little Mix's vocals but were critical of the empowerment theme. \"Change Your Life\" peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart, and charted in the top 10 in Australia and the top 20 in Ireland.\nThe group perform the song in a recording studio in the accompanying music video which includes backstage footage from their first two headlining tour dates. The band promoted the single with televised performances on Children in Need, Dancing on Ice, The Graham Norton Show and This Morning. The track has been performed on four of Little Mix's concert tours, the most recent being the Summer Hits Tour in 2018.\nLittle Mix co-wrote \"Change Your Life\" with Richard Stannard, Tim Powell and Ash Howes. Stannard was among the first producers to work with the group during their formation on the eighth UK series of The X Factor. It was also the first song Little Mix wrote together as a group; Jade Thirlwall said \"I think you can really tell that when you listen to the lyrics... We had just come out of The X Factor, we were thinking about that and thinking about the fans, so it's quite an important one.\"\nThe group travelled to Stannard's studio in Brighton for the writing session. Regarding the writing process, Thirlwall recalled, \"We hadn't written as a group before so we were very nervous and excited. We sat with [Stannard] and thought of ideas, what kind of sound we wanted because at that point we didn't know anything really.\" It was important to the group for the track to have a strong and positive message for their fans. They wrote \"Change Your Life\" with a female narrative in the first verse and a male narrative in the second verse so that the song could relate to both genders.\nLittle Mix first shared the cover art for \"Change Your Life\" on Facebook on 12 December 2012. An accompanying lyric video was released on Vevo the following day. Syco Music released it as the third single from the group's debut album DNA in Ireland on 15 February 2013 and then in the UK two days later as a digital extended play (EP).\nComposed in  time and the key of A major, \"Change Your Life\" is a pop ballad with a moderate tempo of 80 beats per minute. The song is constructed in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third chorus. Little Mix's vocal range spans from the note of A\u2083 to E\u2085. The track opens with descending piano arpeggios and a D\u2013A/C\u266d\u2013E\u2013A chord progression, while the verses have a sequence of D\u2013F\u266dm\u2013E and mix pop vocals with prominent violin accompaniment and a brief drum and bass break before the chorus.\nBoth verses feature solos performed by Leigh-Anne Pinnock in a British-accented spoken rap style, Jesy Nelson who uses a soulful alto and vibrato, and Thirlwall who sings the majority of the song's lines. Perrie Edwards adds a high harmony in the second verse, a high note after the bridge, and belts \"Take it all\" during the harmonised chorus which features kicks and handclaps. The lyrics, according to Thirlwall are about feeling better about yourself and making something of your life. She said, \"The song's called 'Change Your Life' and that's what it's about really.\" Nelson said the track is about \"not letting people put you down and always believing in yourself\".\n\n\"Change Your Life\" received mixed reviews from music critics. In his review for Digital Spy, Lewis Corner gave the song four out of five stars, writing that Little Mix \"reaffirm their sisterhood chemistry with pitch-perfect harmonies\". Ailbhe Malone of The Irish Times said the hook \"will remain in your head for longer than it ought to\", and although \"not as immediately impactful\" as the group's previous singles \"Wings\" and \"DNA\", \"by the third listen, you'll be trying to copy Jesy's soulful alto.\" On the other hand, Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman"

Starr co-wrote it with George Harrison, his former bandmate from the Beatles. Although they collaborated on other songs, it is the only one officially credited to the pair. A signature tune for Starr as a solo artist, \"Photograph\" was an international hit, topping singles charts in the United States, Canada and Australia, and receiving gold disc certification for US sales of 1 million. Music critics have similarly received the song favourably; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considers it to be \"among the very best post-Beatles songs by any of the Fab Four\".\nThe lyrics are a reflection on lost love, whereby a photograph is the only reminder of the protagonists' shared past. Starr and Harrison began writing the song in the South of France in 1971, during a period when Starr was focused on developing his acting career. They first recorded \"Photograph\" late the following year, along with the single's B-side, \"Down and Out\", during the sessions for Harrison's Living in the Material World album. The officially released version was recorded in Los Angeles with producer Richard Perry. It incorporates aspects of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound through the presence of multiple drums and acoustic guitars, as well as an orchestra and a choir. Aside from Starr and Harrison, the musicians on the recording include Nicky Hopkins, Bobby Keys, Jim Keltner, and Spector's musical arranger, Jack Nitzsche. Starr made a promotional film for the single, shot at his and wife Maureen Starkey's home, Tittenhurst Park.\n\"Photograph\" has appeared on Starr's compilation albums Blast from Your Past and Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr, and live versions have featured on releases recorded with his All-Starr Band and with the Roundheads. In November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, Starr sang \"Photograph\" at the Concert for George \u2013 a performance that was an emotional highpoint of the event. Engelbert Humperdinck, Camper Van Beethoven, Cilla Black and Adam Sandler are among the artists who have covered the song.\nEx-Beatles Ringo Starr and George Harrison began writing \"Photograph\" on a luxury yacht in the South of France in May 1971. Starr had hired a yacht, the Marala, for the duration of the Cannes Film Festival, after attending Mick Jagger's wedding in St Tropez with his wife, Maureen Starkey. The Starkeys were then joined in France by Harrison and the latter's wife, Pattie Boyd, for the Monaco Grand Prix. This period coincided with Starr's first success as a solo artist, with the Harrison-produced single \"It Don't Come Easy\", although he continued to focus on his career as a film actor, beginning with a role in Blindman (1971).\nAnother guest on the Marala was Cilla Black, singer and a friend of the Beatles since the 1960s. She recalled Starr and Harrison playing \"Photograph\" during an evening get-together, with \"everyone on board\" contributing ideas for the lyrics. As with Starr's two singles over 1971\u201372, \"It Don't Come Easy\" and \"Back Off Boogaloo\", Harrison helped write the melody, although \"Photograph\" marked the first time that he was credited as a co-writer with Starr. In her autobiography, Step Inside Love, Black says she had hoped to record the song for a single later in 1971, only to be told by Starr: \"No, it's too bloody good for you. I'm having it myself.\"\nThe lyrics to \"Photograph\" are centred around lost love, with the singer having only a single picture by which to remember his absent lover. The photograph reminds him of their former happiness together, while also enforcing the reality that \"you're not coming back any more\". Author Ian Inglis comments on the familiar subject matter in the conventions of pop songwriting, but identifies an atypical aspect in the lyrics' \"absence of any hope that love might be rekindled\". Starr expresses resignation at what the future holds, in the lines \"Now you're expecting me to live without you / But that's not something that I'm looking forward to\".\nThe song is in the key of E, with what Inglis terms an \"easy melody\" that allows for Starr's limitations as a singer. According to authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler, Harrison's \"distinctive composing style\" is particularly evident. Starr"

Written by lead vocalist Tim McIlrath, \"Satellite\" expresses the idea that the band stood by their social and political beliefs, and that they would not conform to mainstream media. The song first premiered on March 4, 2011 in a webisode series detailing the recording process of Endgame, but was not released as the album's third single until November 1, 2011. The song impacted radio on the same day.\nThe song was positively received by critics and praised for its passionate lyrics.\n\"Satellite\" was written by lead vocalist Tim McIlrath in collaboration with the song's producers, Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore. Stevenson and Livermore engineered the song alongside Andrew Berlin, while Chris Lord-Alge served as the mixer. It was recorded at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado and mastered by Ted Jensen. Rise Against first unveiled the song on March 9, 2011 a webisode documenting the studio recording sessions for Endgame. The band later released the track as the album's third and final single on November 1.\nDuring the writing process for Endgame, McIlrath noted how he took inspiration from the song \"Not Ready to Make Nice\" by the country band Dixie Chicks. \"Not Ready to Make Nice\" was written in response to a controversial statement made by Natalie Maines about then U.S. President George W. Bush. The lyrics for \"Satellite\" were inspired by the Dixie Chicks song. McIlrath also saw the song as a way of expressing that the band stood by their beliefs and that they wouldn't conform.\n\"Satellite\" is a melodic hardcore song. John Fortunato of The Aquarian Weekly described the song as a \"fist-pounding mantra\", while Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic commented on how \"Satellite\" was produced to \"enhance the [album's] melodic nature\".\nLyrically, the song features several paradoxes and metaphors, such as \"You can't fill your cup, until you empty all it has\". According to McIlrath, the song's title comes from the idea that \"Rise Against is kind of like a satellite and every once in a while we're in orbit over you - we pop into your lives and play show\".\nThe song was positively received by critics. Chad Grischow of IGN commented on the \"melodic bliss hidden in the [song's] hammering riffs\", and noted how \"Satellite\" and fellow Endgame track \"This Is Letting Go\" make the album a \"tough resist for even those not accustomed to the staggering punk package it wraps it all up in\". Boy labeled the song an \"infectious sing-along\" and praised the track for its fiery and passionate social commentary. Ulf Kubanke of laut.de found \"Satellite\" to be a perfect pop song, praising its anti-establishment message. However, Alex Young of Consequence of Sound described the song as one of the haphazard moments from the album, while John Gentile of Punknews.org felt that some of the lyrics were clich\u00e9d and bland.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Marc Klasfeld, and was released on November 1, 2011. Filmed during numerous Endgame Tour performances, the idea for the video stemmed from the distinct reaction by fans during live performances of the song. In response, the band felt compelled to dedicate the video to their fans. Alongside concert performances, several behind the scenes shots of the concert production crews are also shown.\nA mashup video was produced, combining the music video with various motocross riders, including Blake Williams and Robbie Maddison.\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Endgame.\nTim McIlrath \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar\nZach Blair \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals\nJoe Principe \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals\nBrandon Barnes \u2013 drums\nAdditional backing vocals by Chad Price (All)\nBill Stevenson, Jason Livermore \u2013 producers\nBill Stevenson, Jason Livermore, Andrew Berlin \u2013 audio engineering\nChris Lord-Alge \u2013 mixing\nTed Jensen \u2013 mastering\n\n\n\n\nGrischow, Chad (March 14, 2011). \"Rise Against: Endgame Review\".

Starr co-wrote it with George Harrison, his former bandmate from the Beatles. Although they collaborated on other songs, it is the only one officially credited to the pair. A signature tune for Starr as a solo artist, \"Photograph\" was an international hit, topping singles charts in the United States, Canada and Australia, and receiving gold disc certification for US sales of 1 million. Music critics have similarly received the song favourably; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considers it to be \"among the very best post-Beatles songs by any of the Fab Four\".\nThe lyrics are a reflection on lost love, whereby a photograph is the only reminder of the protagonists' shared past. Starr and Harrison began writing the song in the South of France in 1971, during a period when Starr was focused on developing his acting career. They first recorded \"Photograph\" late the following year, along with the single's B-side, \"Down and Out\", during the sessions for Harrison's Living in the Material World album. The officially released version was recorded in Los Angeles with producer Richard Perry. It incorporates aspects of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound through the presence of multiple drums and acoustic guitars, as well as an orchestra and a choir. Aside from Starr and Harrison, the musicians on the recording include Nicky Hopkins, Bobby Keys, Jim Keltner, and Spector's musical arranger, Jack Nitzsche. Starr made a promotional film for the single, shot at his and wife Maureen Starkey's home, Tittenhurst Park.\n\"Photograph\" has appeared on Starr's compilation albums Blast from Your Past and Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr, and live versions have featured on releases recorded with his All-Starr Band and with the Roundheads. In November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, Starr sang \"Photograph\" at the Concert for George \u2013 a performance that was an emotional highpoint of the event. Engelbert Humperdinck, Camper Van Beethoven, Cilla Black and Adam Sandler are among the artists who have covered the song.\nEx-Beatles Ringo Starr and George Harrison began writing \"Photograph\" on a luxury yacht in the South of France in May 1971. Starr had hired a yacht, the Marala, for the duration of the Cannes Film Festival, after attending Mick Jagger's wedding in St Tropez with his wife, Maureen Starkey. The Starkeys were then joined in France by Harrison and the latter's wife, Pattie Boyd, for the Monaco Grand Prix. This period coincided with Starr's first success as a solo artist, with the Harrison-produced single \"It Don't Come Easy\", although he continued to focus on his career as a film actor, beginning with a role in Blindman (1971).\nAnother guest on the Marala was Cilla Black, singer and a friend of the Beatles since the 1960s. She recalled Starr and Harrison playing \"Photograph\" during an evening get-together, with \"everyone on board\" contributing ideas for the lyrics. As with Starr's two singles over 1971\u201372, \"It Don't Come Easy\" and \"Back Off Boogaloo\", Harrison helped write the melody, although \"Photograph\" marked the first time that he was credited as a co-writer with Starr. In her autobiography, Step Inside Love, Black says she had hoped to record the song for a single later in 1971, only to be told by Starr: \"No, it's too bloody good for you. I'm having it myself.\"\nThe lyrics to \"Photograph\" are centred around lost love, with the singer having only a single picture by which to remember his absent lover. The photograph reminds him of their former happiness together, while also enforcing the reality that \"you're not coming back any more\". Author Ian Inglis comments on the familiar subject matter in the conventions of pop songwriting, but identifies an atypical aspect in the lyrics' \"absence of any hope that love might be rekindled\". Starr expresses resignation at what the future holds, in the lines \"Now you're expecting me to live without you / But that's not something that I'm looking forward to\".\nThe song is in the key of E, with what Inglis terms an \"easy melody\" that allows for Starr's limitations as a singer. According to authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler, Harrison's \"distinctive composing style\" is particularly evident. Starr"

It was produced by Starr's former Beatles bandmate George Harrison, who also helped write the song, although only Starr is credited. Recording for the track took place in March 1970 at Trident Studios in London, with overdubs added in October. Starr and Harrison performed the song together in August 1971 at Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh shows in New York City, a recording from which was released on the live album of the same name. Starr has continued to perform it in subsequent decades with his All-Starr Band.\nApart from in North America, where \"Beaucoups of Blues\" had been a single in October 1970, \"It Don't Come Easy\" was Starr's first single release since the break-up of the Beatles. Heavily promoted by Apple Records, the song was a commercial success, peaking at number 1 in Canada and number 4 on singles charts in the UK and the US. It was critically well received on release and remains one of his most popular hits as a solo artist.\nRingo Starr began writing \"It Don't Come Easy\" in late 1968, having recently completed his first composition, \"Don't Pass Me By\". When referring to his early songwriting efforts in a 2003 interview, he described himself as \"great at writing two verses and a chorus\" but often unable to develop the ideas further. Although Starr received sole writing credit for \"It Don't Come Easy\", Beatles historian Bruce Spizer writes that he had \"substantial, but uncredited, assistance\" from his bandmate George Harrison. In author Robert Rodriguez's description, the official songwriting credit was long thought to be \"bogus\" and, notwithstanding Starr's involvement, a sign of Harrison's \"great generosity\" in wanting to help the drummer establish himself independently of the Beatles.\nThe song's original title was \"You Gotta Pay Your Dues\". Starr completed it as the Beatles were heading towards disbandment in early 1970, following John Lennon's unpublicised decision to leave the group in September 1969. Starr said that in trying to find a song that would establish his identity at this time, he had to \"combat\u00a0... the original image of me as the downtrodden drummer\", adding, \"You don't know how hard it is to fight that.\" In journalist Bob Woffinden's view, as \"It Don't Come Easy\", the title alone \"[betrayed] a wealth of information\" about Starr's feelings of vulnerability while the other Beatles, as proven songwriters, could each look to further their achievements outside the band.\nIn its completed form, the song opens and closes with a lead guitar riff. Music historian Andrew Grant Jackson describes the lyrics as \"Starr's exhortation to stay resilient in the face of hardship\", and he views the reference to paying \"your dues\" as an apt image, given Starr's health issues as a child and limited education. In Rodriguez's view, the song was most likely inspired by \"a Ringo-ism or two\", but the guitar riff, \"quasi-philosophical\" lyrics and other musical details make it a typical Harrison composition from the period.\nStarr subsequently acknowledged that Harrison helped write \"It Don't Come Easy\". He discussed the song's creation during his appearance on VH1 Storytellers in 1998. Starr said: \"I wrote this song with the one and only George Harrison.\" He went on to say that Harrison suggested the last verse be about God. When Starr protested, Harrison suggested Hare Krishna. Starr protested again, and Harrison suggested \"peace\" as a topic, and they settled on that.\n\nStarr first recorded the new composition during the sessions for Sentimental Journey. The latter project was an album of pre-rock 'n' roll standards that he undertook to keep active following Lennon's decision, and to please his mother. Recording for the song began at all-night session on 18 February 1970 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios), with George Martin producing. The studio log listed the track as \"You Gotta Pay Your Dues\". Harrison played acoustic guitar and directed the other musicians \u2013 namely Starr (on drums), Klaus Voormann (bass) and Stephen Stills (piano). They taped 20 takes of the basic track. Starr added a vocal to the take selected as best and Harrison two electric guitar parts, and by 4.40am the recording had been mixed.\nOn 19 February, after final overdubs were carried out on \"Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing\" during an afternoon session at EMI, recording resumed on \"You Gotta Pay Your Dues\", with Starr adding another lead vocal. Harrison was not present that evening, although Eric"

It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album Prism (2013) on October 16, 2013, two days before the album was released. Inspiration for the song came primarily from a humanitarian trip to Madagascar that Perry made in partnership with UNICEF. Having been surrounded by what she described as unconditional love, she co-wrote it with the song's producers Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Cirkut to reflect that feeling.\n\"Unconditionally\" is a power ballad styled in rock, backed against a bassline and percussion. Commercially, it peaked within the top ten in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Lebanon, and South Africa as well as the top twenty in Australia, Austria, Canada, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and the United States.\nThe single release was promoted with an Instagram-based campaign, a lyric video directed by Aya Tanimura and live performances\u2014one of the latter, at the American Music Awards of 2013, was the center of controversy due to accusations of cultural appropriation. Brent Benacorso served as the director for the track's music video, which adopts the theme of love and uses a series of metaphors to enrich its concept.\n\"Unconditionally\" was written by Perry alongside its producers Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Cirkut. Perry denoted the song as her favorite within the record. She also mentioned that she wrote the song bearing in mind the sentiments she had felt during her UNICEF humanitarian trip to Madagascar in April 2013. Such sentiments inspired her to delve into the theme of unconditional love. She stated that, while on that voyage, Perry and her team would \"go in cruisers up the mountain\" to see newly constructed schools. After observing a group of children, she realized that even without social networking, they felt \"pure\" unconditional love towards each other.\nInspired by that situation, the song was described by Perry as approaching all forms of love. \"I love this song because not only can it be a romantic, intimate song\", she expounded. \"But it can be about the type of love that a mother has when she sees her first child, or best friends [...] It is a transcendent love, not just relationship status.\" \"Unconditionally\" was also inspired by the acceptance of one's flaws in a relationship, which Perry believed was relatable to listeners. It was engineered by Peter Carlsson, Clint Gibbs, Sam Holland, and Michael Illbert, with assistance by Eric Eylands, Rachael Findlen, Justin Fox, and Cory Bice, at the MXM Studios in Stockholm, Sweden and Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Perry also handled vocal production. Engineering for mix was carried out by John Hanes and final mixing was helmed by Serban Ghenea at the MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\nAt a length of three minutes and forty-eight seconds (3:48), \"Unconditionally\" is a pop power ballad, which is styled in the genre of rock. According to the sheet music published by Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc. at Musicnotes.com, it is written in the key of G major. It paces at a moderately fast metronome, at approximately 129 beats per minute, while it is set at a 4/4 time signature, following a chord progression of Em\u2013C\u2013G\u2013D. Perry's vocals in the track span from G\u2083 to E\u2085. The track's \"uncluttered\" instrumentation features woodblock percussion and a \"dramatic\" bass line. Lyrically, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard deemed it the \"most mature offering\" on Prism, claiming it served as a \"predicate\" to Perry's 2010 single \"Teenage Dream\".\nIn September 2013, Perry teased the release of the song as the second single from Prism, without revealing its title or date. However, MTV concluded that such song was \"Unconditionally\", which she discussed during a listening party for the record. The release was confirmed by Billboard. The track debuted on October 16, 2013 and was serviced by Capitol Records to contemporary hit radio stations in the United States on October 22. The next day, it was sent to Australian radio stations. A CD single was released in Germany on November 22\u2014 the same date it was serviced to radios in Italy. In France, imports of the CD started being sold on December 3. A remix version of the song by Johnson Somerset was featured on a compilation album entitled Songs for the Philippines benefiting those affected by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.\nThe"

It was released as the first single from her debut solo album, Deadline for My Memories. Written by Martin and David Harrow, it is known to be one of her most notable singles. It was produced by English electronic dance group the Grid and was originally released on 31 October 1994. The track found greater chart success in 1995, when it peaked at number one in Italy and on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs and number 6 on the UK Singles Chart. On the Eurochart Hot 100, \"Your Loving Arms\" reached number 21. There were made two different music videos for the song. In 1996, Mixmag ranked it at number 47 in its 100 Greatest Dance Singles Of All Time list.\n\"Your Loving Arms\" received favorable reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor John Bush described it as a \"magical\" electro-pop track. On the 1994 release, Larry Flick from Billboard called it \"a spirited foray into trancecarpeted hi-NRG territory. Her distinctively creamy voice has seldom sounded so strong and worldly, giving the song's romantic prose a decidedly dark and anxious edge.\" In 1995, he added it as \"an NRGetic dance number that makes excellent use of her milky soprano range. Her torchy style makes an intriguing contrast with the Grid's cool and rigid groove production.\" He also called it \"deliciously dramatic\". Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report said that \"there's something in Billie Ray's voice that is simply magnetic. This one-time member of London's Electribe 101 releases a lot of electricity on her own as proven by one super hot dance track.\" Ross Jones from The Guardian complimented the singer as the \"owner of this era's most haunting voice\". He wrote, \"At first, this high-octane disco spinner doesn't seem like the best place for her Marlene-meets-Aretha tones, but listen closely and try imagining anyone else caressing it so lovingly, with such unassailable cool.\" On the re-release, he called it a \"glowing piece of dancefloor TNT\". \nJohn Hamilton from Idolator described it as \"fiery\" and \"a predestined club classic, a pulsating techno torch song in which Martin sasses, vamps, and pleads over ominous rising chords and a frantic tambourine-inflected beat.\" Howard Cohen from Knight Ridder said that \"an instantly memorable hook, retro-disco beat and warm, inviting vocals make this the most musical dance offering 1995 has offered so far.\" Music writer James Masterton commented, \"Her first solo hit is more of what she has become known for, a haunting, slinky piece of dance music that is so good as to be utterly uncommercial.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote, \"Is there such a thing as adult-orientated pop dance? If there isn't yet, then it is debuting right here thanks to a lady who looks like Marianne Faithfull's twin sister with the voice of Carly Simon.\" James Hamilton from Music Week's RM Dance Update deemed it \"mournful\" and \"husky\". Barry Walters from Spin stated that it \"was the pop song with underground credibility, one that everyone could agree had something special. Martin's lyrics speak of profound joy and pain, the melody soars through consciousness like a caress, and the vocal sets itself apart from the wailing of generic gut-busting divas.\"\n\"Your Loving Arms\" was a major hit in Europe and remains Ray Martin's most successful song to date. It went to number-one in Italy and was a Top 10 hit in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 6 in its second week on the UK Singles Chart, on May 21, 1995. But on the UK Dance Chart, the single reached number 2. On the Eurochart Hot 100, \"Your Loving Arms\" peaked at number 21 on June 3, 1995. Outside Europe, it hit number-one on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs, number 5 in Israel and number 85 in Australia in November 1995. Additionally, the single also went to number 46 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 30 on the US Cash Box singles chart in 1996. It received a silver record in the United Kingdom with a sale of 200,000 singles.\nThere were made two different music videos for the song. The UK version is in black-and-white and features Ray Martin performing the song in a bedroom, sometimes lying on the bed or sitting in a chair. Other scenes features the singer walking in a garden or dancing with a man in a hallway. The second version is in colours. The UK version was uploaded to YouTube in 2014.\nBritish electronic and clubbing magazine Mixmag listed the song at number 47 in its"

The artists co-wrote the song with its producers Afrojack, Diplo, and Free School, with additional writing from Ryan Buendia. Musically, \"Look at Me Now\" is a \"dirty south\u2013inspired\" hip hop song that features \"thumping bass, spacy synth and horn jam sounds.\"\nCritical reception towards the song was positive, where critics noted it as a standout track on the album, and praised Busta Rhymes and Lil Wayne's rap verses. \"Look at Me Now\" proved to be successful in the United States, where it reached number\u00a0six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it Brown's highest chart position since \"Forever\" (2008). It also reached number\u00a0one on the Hot\u00a0Rap\u00a0Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.

It features numerous scenes of Brown, Busta Rhymes, and Lil Wayne in a smoke-filled, graffiti-covered parking garage, where a Step Up-type dance-off is held. The video received a positive response from critics for displaying various colors and intricate routines performed by Brown and several dancers. The song won three awards at the 2011 BET Awards for Best Collaboration, Viewer's Choice and Video of the Year. Several artists have covered the song and released their own remixes, including Karmin, Justin Bieber, Trey Songz and Da Brat.\nThe artists co-wrote \"Look at Me Now\" with its producers Afrojack, Diplo, and Free School, with additional writing from Ryan Buendia. The song was recorded and mixed by Brian Springer at The Record Plant\u2014a studio in Los Angeles, California. \"Look at Me Now\" was released for digital download on February 1, 2011, and was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States on February 8. In an interview with Vibe magazine, Diplo revealed that when he was first asked to put the song together, he thought that \"Look at Me Now\" was not for an official release, saying: \"I knew that I was working on something for a Chris Brown record, but I thought it was for a mixtape... When I did the beat, I gave it to one of his writers. Then Busta Rhymes got on it and I was like, 'Okay, this is going to be a club record.' And then when Wayne got on it 'Look at Me Now' became a radio record. It just took off from there.\"\n\"Look at Me Now\" is a \"dirty south\u2013inspired\" hip hop song that features American rappers Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes. According to Chad Grischow from IGN, the song features \"thumping bass, spacy synth and horn jam sounds.\" Electronic background mixes are also present in the song. Over a hip hop drum beat that evokes Cali Swag District's 2010 single \"Teach Me How to Dougie\", \"Brown sings that he's still riding high (in a yellow Lamborghini, to boot) before venturing off into a typically tasteless discussion of his manhood\", according to staff members from Idolator. Jon Caramanica from The New York Times also wrote that on the song, Brown \"double-time-raps about stealing girlfriends.\" Akshay Bhansali from MTV News wrote that \"Look\u00a0at\u00a0Me\u00a0Now\" features \"a fast-rapping flurry of awesome self-indulgence courtesy of Busta Rhymes, Lil Wayne and Chris, with an eerie downtempo beat cooked up by chefs Afrojack and Diplo.\" Afrojack told MTV News that the song was the product of a beat he passed to Diplo. \"Yeah, Diplo called me... He was like, 'We are in the studio right now, and we are gonna do a track on the beat.' And I was like, 'OK, whatever. Have fun.'\"\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Look at Me Now\" was directed by Colin Tilley and filmed in Los Angeles, California on February 16, 2011. Images from the shoot were released online the next day, as one of the images showed Chris Brown, Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes standing on top of an ambulance car in front of an industrial building, while another image showed the DeLorean sports car from the 1985 film, Back to the Future. The video premiered online on March 9, 2011. Brown spoke about the video in an interview with MTV News, saying,\nWith the concept of \"Look at Me Now\" you know this"

It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album Prism (2013) on October 16, 2013, two days before the album was released. Inspiration for the song came primarily from a humanitarian trip to Madagascar that Perry made in partnership with UNICEF. Having been surrounded by what she described as unconditional love, she co-wrote it with the song's producers Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Cirkut to reflect that feeling.\n\"Unconditionally\" is a power ballad styled in rock, backed against a bassline and percussion. Commercially, it peaked within the top ten in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Lebanon, and South Africa as well as the top twenty in Australia, Austria, Canada, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and the United States.\nThe single release was promoted with an Instagram-based campaign, a lyric video directed by Aya Tanimura and live performances\u2014one of the latter, at the American Music Awards of 2013, was the center of controversy due to accusations of cultural appropriation. Brent Benacorso served as the director for the track's music video, which adopts the theme of love and uses a series of metaphors to enrich its concept.\n\"Unconditionally\" was written by Perry alongside its producers Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Cirkut. Perry denoted the song as her favorite within the record. She also mentioned that she wrote the song bearing in mind the sentiments she had felt during her UNICEF humanitarian trip to Madagascar in April 2013. Such sentiments inspired her to delve into the theme of unconditional love. She stated that, while on that voyage, Perry and her team would \"go in cruisers up the mountain\" to see newly constructed schools. After observing a group of children, she realized that even without social networking, they felt \"pure\" unconditional love towards each other.\nInspired by that situation, the song was described by Perry as approaching all forms of love. \"I love this song because not only can it be a romantic, intimate song\", she expounded. \"But it can be about the type of love that a mother has when she sees her first child, or best friends [...] It is a transcendent love, not just relationship status.\" \"Unconditionally\" was also inspired by the acceptance of one's flaws in a relationship, which Perry believed was relatable to listeners. It was engineered by Peter Carlsson, Clint Gibbs, Sam Holland, and Michael Illbert, with assistance by Eric Eylands, Rachael Findlen, Justin Fox, and Cory Bice, at the MXM Studios in Stockholm, Sweden and Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Perry also handled vocal production. Engineering for mix was carried out by John Hanes and final mixing was helmed by Serban Ghenea at the MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\nAt a length of three minutes and forty-eight seconds (3:48), \"Unconditionally\" is a pop power ballad, which is styled in the genre of rock. According to the sheet music published by Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc. at Musicnotes.com, it is written in the key of G major. It paces at a moderately fast metronome, at approximately 129 beats per minute, while it is set at a 4/4 time signature, following a chord progression of Em\u2013C\u2013G\u2013D. Perry's vocals in the track span from G\u2083 to E\u2085. The track's \"uncluttered\" instrumentation features woodblock percussion and a \"dramatic\" bass line. Lyrically, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard deemed it the \"most mature offering\" on Prism, claiming it served as a \"predicate\" to Perry's 2010 single \"Teenage Dream\".\nIn September 2013, Perry teased the release of the song as the second single from Prism, without revealing its title or date. However, MTV concluded that such song was \"Unconditionally\", which she discussed during a listening party for the record. The release was confirmed by Billboard. The track debuted on October 16, 2013 and was serviced by Capitol Records to contemporary hit radio stations in the United States on October 22. The next day, it was sent to Australian radio stations. A CD single was released in Germany on November 22\u2014 the same date it was serviced to radios in Italy. In France, imports of the CD started being sold on December 3. A remix version of the song by Johnson Somerset was featured on a compilation album entitled Songs for the Philippines benefiting those affected by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.\nThe"

The song was written by lead vocalist Noddy Holder and bassist Jim Lea, and produced by Chas Chandler. It was the band's sixth and final number-one single in the UK. Earning the UK Christmas number one slot in December 1973, the song beat another Christmas-themed song, Wizzard's \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\", which reached fourth place. It remained in the charts for nine weeks until February 1974.\nReleased at the peak of the band's popularity, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" sold over a million copies upon its first release. It is Slade's last number-one single, and \nby far their best-selling single. It has been released during every decade since 1973, and has been covered by numerous artists. The single was certified UK Platinum by BPI in December 1980. Since 2007 and the advent of downloads counting towards the UK Singles Chart, it has re-entered the charts each December. As of December 2012, it has sold 1.32\u00a0million copies in the UK.\nIn a UK television special on ITV in December 2012, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" was voted third (behind \"Fairytale of New York\" and \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\") in The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song.\nAccording to the Fan Club Newsletter for January and February 1974, the song was awarded a Silver Disc for pre-order sales. Within the first week of release, the single had sold 500,000 copies. Also, according to the same newsletter, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" was in such big demand that Polydor records had to make special arrangements to have 250,000 discs sent from Los Angeles, as well as 30,000 copies a day they were receiving from Germany.\nBy 1973, Slade were one of the most popular bands in Britain, having achieved two number one singles\u2014\"Cum On Feel The Noize\" and \"Skweeze Me Pleeze Me\"\u2014in three months. These singles had both entered the charts straight at number one, a feat unheard of since The Beatles with \"Get Back\" in 1969. During the year, manager Chas Chandler suggested that Slade write and record a Christmas song. Although the other band members were initially against the idea, Lea came up with the basis of the song while taking a shower. After coming up with the verse melody, Lea recalled a song Holder had discarded in 1967, which he had written when the band were named the 'N Betweens. Entitled \"Buy Me a Rocking Chair\", it was Holder's first solo work. \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" used the melody of this song for the chorus, with Lea's melody as the verse. Speaking to Record Mirror in 1984, Lea revealed: \n\"Nod had written the chorus of it in 1967. In those days it was all flower power and Sgt. Pepper and Nod had written this tune. The verse was naff but then he came to the chorus and went 'Buy me a rocking chair to watch the world go by, buy me a looking glass, I'll look you in the eye' - very Sgt. Pepper. I don't use tape recorders, I just remember everything and if something's been written 10 or 15 years ago, it stays up there in my head. I never forgot that chorus, and I was in the shower in America somewhere thinking - Bob Dylan, Bob Dylan - and suddenly out came \"are you hanging up the stocking on the wall\" and I thought that'll go with that chorus Nod did in '67. So I rang Nod and said what about doing a Christmas song and he said alright, so I played it to him and that was it.\"\nAfter an evening out drinking, Holder worked through the night at his mother's house in Walsall to write the lyrics, which he completed in one draft.\nHolder presented his lyrics to Lea, and the pair played the song to Chandler on acoustic guitars. Slade then set off on a sell-out tour. Ten weeks before the song was recorded, drummer Don Powell was injured in a car accident. His girlfriend Angela Morris was killed, and Powell remained in a coma for almost a week. After his eventual recovery, he was able to join the band to record the song. In 2009, PRS for Music announced that up to forty-two percent of the world's population could have listened to the song.\nThe song was recorded in the late summer of 1973, partway through Slade's east coast US tour, at the Record Plant in New York, where John Lennon had just finished working on his album Mind Games. \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" took"

Released through Def Jam Recordings, the song impacted on mainstream radio stations in the US on 8 July 2014, as the fifth single from her debut studio album, The New Classic (2014). It was written by Azalea, Katy Perry, Sarah Hudson, Benny Blanco, and duo Stargate, while the latter also produced the song. Its  lyrics chronicle subjects of revenge and feminism in a failed romantic relationship. An accompanying music video for the song was released on 13 August 2014.\nInitially a track recorded by Katy Perry for her fourth studio album, Prism (2013), it was excluded from Prism track listing, and Perry handed the demo to Azalea for her to complete. \"Black Widow\" has been described as \"channeling the trap\" genre, containing an ominous steel drum rhythm, heavy bass and a sparse beat. The song peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Azalea's third top-five hit, following \"Fancy\" and \"Problem\". The song also became Ora's first top-three hit in the US. It has also reached number four in the UK and number fifteen in Australia.\nIts composition has been the subject of music critics' comparisons to Perry's \"Dark Horse\". Other journalists, praised its beat and Azalea and Ora's vocals. \"Black Widow\" charted due to strong digital sales during the debut week of The New Classic. Accordingly, before becoming a single it achieved peaks of number 91 in the United Kingdom and number 86 in Australia, and appeared on several component charts. Azalea has performed the song live as part of the set list for her first headlining tour, The New Classic Tour (2014). The song is featured on the video game Just Dance 2015.\nIn early 2013, Azalea became friends with American singer Katy Perry through Chris Anokute, an A&R at Azalea's record label Def Jam Recordings. Anokute, who previously was an A&R for Perry at her label Capitol Records, told Azalea that Perry was a fan of her music. When Azalea was nominated at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, Anokute asked Perry if she could promote Azalea's nomination in her category for Artist to Watch. Perry then took to Twitter to rave about Azalea's music, and Azalea later consulted Anokute about a future collaboration with Perry. Shortly afterward, Azalea and Perry begun working together with the latter's frequent collaborator Dr. Luke, but the collaboration proved unsuccessful. Azalea then heard about a song Perry recorded, \"Black Widow\", which was going to be given away to another artist. The song was initially written as a last-minute addition to Perry's fourth studio album, Prism (2013), but the composition finalized only after the album's release. Azalea described the track as \"a legend\" and a \"mysterious record\", before she could finally hear it.\nOn 4 June 2013, Azalea confirmed that British recording artist Rita Ora would feature on her debut studio The New Classic, after previously announcing Ora's feature on 26 December 2012. She stated, \"I had a song in mind, and I need a woman with a big voice to sing the chorus because I can't do it\". Azalea then asked Perry if she could record \"Black Widow\" for her album, which Perry then agreed to. The record, however, was never sent to Azalea and on 1 August 2013, she denied that Ora would be collaborating with her on the album. Azalea then met Perry for the first time, as her supporting act at the iTunes Festival that year. At the festival, Perry approached Azalea with an offer to record \"Black Widow\" as she felt the song would suit her better. Azalea was then invited to Perry's after party that night, where the two exchanged numbers, and Perry sent Azalea the record. When Azalea received the song, it only consisted of a hook and a beat. She initially wanted Perry to sing the song's hook, but Perry was unable to because of time constraints. In an interview, Azalea mentioned, \"It needed someone who could really sing, as Katy's voice is awesome. The sky's the limit for Rita. Rita's a superstar and she will only get bigger. Rita is a great fit. Her voice can blow people away.\" Azalea and Ora then begun recording \"Black Widow\" in November 2013 after the MTV Europe Music Awards, and completed it in January 2014.\nThe final version of \"Black Widow\" was co-written by Azalea, Perry, Sarah Hudson, Benny Blanco, and its producers StarGate."

I mean, I actually remember the day I wrote it with Eg White. Something had upset me, and I was like 'You know, people just forget what's important'... And then I literally just said 'It's not your money, it's not your car - it's LOVE!' - and straightaway we were both like 'Oh, we've got a SONG here!'!...

It was released in the UK and Ireland on 20 December 2009 by Fascination Records (Polydor Records) and later in 2010 by Universal Music, sometimes serving as the lead single for 3 Words. The uptempo dance-pop song was written by Cole and George Pajon. It was also written and produced by will.i.am who has guest vocals on the song. \"3 Words\" was cited by Cole as her favourite song from the album for being different from what people expected.\n\"3 Words\" was praised by contemporary critics, who said it was \"a sophisticated love song\" and the \"standout track\" from the album. Its unconventional production abandons the use of \"verse-chorus-verse\" structure, instead opting for a throbbing buildup to a climax. The accompanying video, directed by Saam, features the singer in various fashion ensembles often contrasting colour with will.i.am, and paying homage to Madonna. It also makes use of split screen cinematography and camera effects for the transition of scenes.\nThe song was promoted on Cheryl Cole's Night In. The single was less commercially successful compared to its predecessor \"Fight for This Love\" but despite not peaking at number one, it went on to become Cole's second consecutive UK top-five and Irish-top ten hit. It was also a top five hit in Australia and has since been certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association and silver by the British Phonographic Industry.\n\"3 Words\" is an uptempo dance-pop song which features guest vocals from will.i.am who produced the song as well as, writing the lyrics with Cole and George Pajon. Serving as the opening and title song of Cole's debut album, the song is written in the key of C\u266f minor with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 129 beats per minute. Noticeably missing is the standard use of a \"verse-chorus-verse song structure\". The song's backing track consists of a sparse yet complex chord progression of C\u266fm, G\u266fm, C\u266f and A major/C\u266f. The production features loops of acoustic guitar with a piano melody in the vocal range of G\u266f\u2083 to B\u2084.\nCritics stated that the \"sophisticated love song\" is difficult to class by genre because it was \"unconventional\", something which Cole agreed when she said, \"[its] totally different from anything I've done [with Girls Aloud] or liked before\". Some industry critics also noted that \"3 Words\" was \"unlike many things currently [at that time] on radio or being released\". Cole said that the song was inspired by her newly acquired love for dance music on the charts, especially David Guetta & Kelly Rowland's \"When Love Takes Over\".\nCole described it as her favourite song on the album and music critics generally agreed. Tom Ewing of The Guardian called the song Cheryl's \"showcase [...] built on dark loops of treated acoustic guitar and building into a claustrophobic dance track. It's as brave and novel a song as anything Cole's group have released.\" Daniel Wilcox even went as far as to say the song was \"far more interesting and innovative than anything her girl group has done in their entire careers.\" \"3 Words\" has been described as \"mesmerizing in its listlessness\" as well as being \"unlike anything Cheryl or Will.I.Am have released\" and \"to what's currently being played on the radio.\" It was labeled a standout track by many reviewers, with Killian Fox of The Observer referring to the song as \"a slick, sophisticated love song that hints at what this album could have been.\" David Balls of Digital Spy wrote, \"Snubbing traditional verse-chorus-verse song structure, and beginning with spare acoustic guitar strums, '3 Words' builds slowly towards a throbbing and infectious, if slightly brief, arms-in-the-air climax [...] it's hard to deny that Chez pulls off this less-than-obvious offering with aplomb.\"\nLouise McCudden of Inthenews.co.uk, however, argued that although \"her voice sounds pleasant [...] the song itself is too long and becomes tedious fairly fast.\" Vicki Lutas had a mostly negative review for the song saying \"at the end of the day it does sound like something you could have made up when you were at school\", though she did praise the backing track for being \"dark, eerie and cold in a chilling way; in an infectious way\". However she pointed out that \"the vocal arrangement and the actual vocals themselves do nothing more for the song\", and respected"

I mean, I actually remember the day I wrote it with Eg White. Something had upset me, and I was like 'You know, people just forget what's important'... And then I literally just said 'It's not your money, it's not your car - it's LOVE!' - and straightaway we were both like 'Oh, we've got a SONG here!'!... And, while I know it sounds cheesy, I genuinely do think those sentiments are TRUE! Plus, I was standing in line and wondering why it don't move\"\nAccording to the sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing, \"Nothing's Real but Love\" is a soul and pop song set in common time with 72 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of A Major, with the vocal range from the note of A3 to F#5.

Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song four stars out of five and a positive review, stating:\n\"No money, no house, no car/ Is like love,\" she calmly ponders over gentle acoustics, allowing nothing but her voice to do the talking - one that is just as raw and shaky as it was this time last year but now with an added hint of diva ambition [...] the result is smooth, premium and leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy inside immediately after.\nA music video to accompany the release of \"Nothing's Real but Love\" was first released onto YouTube on 2 November 2011 at a total length of two minutes and fifty-one seconds, which showed Ferguson performing live with her band.\nThe official video premiered on Ferguson's official website on 23 November and then went to all UK music channels.

It is the second single from his seventh album Armageddon and was released digitally in Australia on 11 May 2012. An EP with two new songs and a remix of a previous single \"Who's That Girl\" was released in CD format on 1 June 2012 and digitally on 15 June 2012. \"Gold\" peaked at number ten on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified platinum in 2014. It was Sebastian's ninth of 12 top ten singles on the Australian charts.\n\"Gold\" is an uptempo soul song. During an interview on Australian radio station Nova 96.9 Sebastian said \"Gold\" was special to him because he was a huge Otis Redding fan, and he had inserted a horn line from a 1967 live recording of an Otis Redding track called \"Shake\" into the song. Discussing the inspiration for the song, he said: \"You hear an old soul track, old Motown or Memphis, and it just makes you get on your feet.\" He elaborated, \"It's probably the most fun, up-tempo song I've ever released to sing [...] Because it's such aggressive soul... By the end of the track I'm jumping out of my skin. It's one of those singer songs.\" Sebastian said in an interview with Take 40 that the idea for lyrics came because of a friend who always used the term \"That's Gold\".\nThere was some controversy surrounding the song when The Voice final 24 contestant Carmen Smith, who performed backing vocals on the track, was asked to leave the show because she appeared in the video. The Voice producers said she had broken the \"spirit\" of the rules as the video would give her an unfair advantage over other contestants. Smith later stated that she had performed with Sebastian for years, and had a clause in her The Voice contract which allowed her to continue to perform and record with him. She thought appearing in the video would be permitted under her contract, but that The Voice producers saw things differently: \"We had differences in opinion but in the end that is how they felt about it and I just had to go home and accept it. [...] The fact that this has happened, it is unfortunate, but the positive is that I get to move on and do what I do best and sing with Guy again.\"\n\"Gold\" was serviced to radio on 4 May 2012 and was the second most added song to Australian radio for two consecutive weeks. It peaked at number 26 on the national airplay charts. Sebastian performed the song on the Seven Network's Dancing with the Stars, Australia's Got Talent and Sunrise.\n\nA reviewer for Take 40 wrote: \"It's already becoming one of our favourite new tunes! The song is super-fast and full of fun vibes and has an upbeat Motown feel to it!\" Power Fm announcer Bella Frizza said: \"'GOLD' has just been released and you know what? I reckon it is just that -GOLDEN! But hey don't trust my ears \u2013 listen for yourself and if you're not dancing round your office/bedroom/loungeroom within about 40 seconds then I want to hear why!\" Music site auspOp wrote: \"We can't tell you how happy we are that Guy Sebastian has ditched the R&B/dance hybrid sound for his latest single 'Gold'. 'Cause this new tune is precisely what Guy does best - oozing with class and old school soul. 'Gold' sounds like it could have been ripped straight from the streets of '60s Detroit, what with its flashy brass, gorgeous gospel chorus and Guy's insane pitch-perfect vocal. [...] 'Gold' is quite simply pure, unadulterated joy.\"\n\"Gold\" debuted and peaked at number ten on the ARIA Singles Chart, and achieved platinum certification in 2014. It was Sebastian's ninth of 12 top ten singles in Australia.\nThe accompanying music video for \"Gold\" premiered in May 2012. It was filmed at an old warehouse at the Mill Markets in Geelong, Victoria. Sebastian said the concept came from an old Billy Preston video. He sent it to the producers as a reference and the \"Gold\" video evolved from there. It is set at a 1950s warehouse party, and Sebastian and his band are shown performing to an audience dressed in clothing of the era. He and his backing vocalist leave the stage and join the dancers on the dance floor. The video is shot in black and white, and in the last 45 seconds is infused with gold highlights and then progresses to full subdued colour.\n\n\n\n\nDigital single\n\"Gold\" \u2013 3:22\nExtended play CD and digital download\n\"Gold\" \u2013 3:24\n\"Diamond in My Hand\" \u2013 3:24\n\"Lost in the Streets of LA\" \u2013 3:32\n\"Who's That Girl\" (7th Heaven Radio Mix) \u2013 3:59\nLead vocals (all tracks) \u2013 Guy Sebastian\n\n\n \n\"Gold\"\nWriters \u2013 Guy Sebastian, Harmony \"H-Money\""

The song was written by Blondie keyboardist Jimmy Destri and produced by Craig Leon. Taken from their album No Exit (1999), it was Blondie's first new release since 1982. \"Maria\", issued as a single in Europe on January 11, 1999, reached number one in the United Kingdom; Blondie's sixth UK chart-topper. The song also topped the charts of Greece and Spain, becoming a top-20 hit across Europe and in New Zealand.\nThe song was included on the band's 2014 compilation album, Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux. The compilation was part of a two-disc set titled Blondie 4(0) Ever, which includes Ghosts of Download, their tenth studio album, and marked the 40th anniversary of the band's formation.\n\"Maria\" was written by the band's keyboardist, Jimmy Destri, who had penned some of their earlier hits such as \"Atomic\". He wrote the song while reflecting on his days in Catholic school, when he fantasized about meeting the ideal girl. According to Destri, the track is about teenage desire. A line from the song: \"...like a millionaire/walking on imported air\", was used in the previous Blondie track \"Walk Like Me\" (also written by Destri) from the album Autoamerican (1980), and the track shares a similar lyrical motif with their 1977 single \"Rip Her to Shreds\". \"Maria\" is written and composed in the key of A major.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Maria\" was released as a two-CD set. The first contains remixes of the song, and the second contains live versions of \"Screaming Skin\" (a track from the No Exit album) and their first hit single: \"In the Flesh\". Both were recorded during Blondie's No Exit Tour.\nBillboard described the song as a \"delectable track\", and a \"skillfully arranged array of passionate Debbie Harry vocals, great guitar and drum thrusts, and neat harmonica passages that climb into the toll of cathedral bells.\" They also noted that \"all these touches are in the service of a cool rock/pop intelligence powered by the street smarts that are the Blondie trademark.\" Daily Record commented, \"Almost two decades after their last No 1, comeback stars Blondie have gone back to their \"new wave\" roots\" with \"Maria\". The Daily Vault's Mark Millan called it a \"pop gem\" that \"kicks off\". He added that the singer's \"commanding performance\" really shows off her impressive range, and stated that \"this one is still one of their best singles to date.\"\n\"Maria\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on February 7, 1999, giving Blondie their sixth UK number-one single and first chart-topper since \"The Tide Is High\" in November 1980. It spent 17 nonconsecutive weeks in the top 100, ending the year as the UK's 33rd-best-selling hit. The release of \"Maria\" came exactly 20 years after \"Heart of Glass\", Blondie's first UK number-one hit. Across the rest of Europe, \"Maria\" topped the charts in Greece and Spain and was a top-10 hit in Austria, Flanders, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland. It additionally reached the top 20 in Italy and the Netherlands and attained a peak of number five on the Eurochart Hot 100.\n\"Maria\" was not as successful in the North America, stalling at number 82 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 43 on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart; however, it did enter the top 20 on the Billboard Adult Top 40, Hot Dance Club Play, and Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales charts. The single also underperformed in Australia, where it peaked at number 59, but fared better in New Zealand, reaching number 16 during its third week on the country's chart.\nThe music video for \"Maria\" was directed by Roman Coppola (credited as Alan Smithee), and takes place in New York City. Parts of New York through night-vision goggles are seen before zooming into an apartment where Blondie are performing the song. Mysterious dark-clothed individuals are seen around different buildings setting up surveillance equipment to monitor the band. Toward the end of the video, one of the dark-clothed individuals aims a sniper rifle towards lead singer Deborah Harry, and fires a bullet at her. In slow motion, the bullet smashes through a window, a light bulb and the microphone towards her, but Harry (moving in real time) simply plucks the bullet from the air before it hits her (perhaps tying into the theme of \"no exit\", the band's comeback album).\nUS 12-inch single\nA1. \"Maria\" (Soul Solution Full Remix)\nA2. \"Maria\""

The song was written by frontman Courtney Taylor-Taylor after seeing a woman pull up in her car to the traffic lights outside his apartment. It was released as the second single from the band's third studio album, Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia, on July 11, 2000.\nUpon its original release, it failed to reach the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 42, even after a yearlong tour. After featuring in a popular Vodafone advertisement, it was re-released on October 9, 2001, and peaked at No. 5 on the same chart.\nLead singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor said the song was inspired when he saw a woman in a car stopped at the traffic light below his apartment window and began to fantasize about a relationship with her. He said, \"My silly little brain ran amok with the dream of love and vintage motor malfunctions. It was only natural to weave it into a song on the spot.\"\nLouis Pattison of NME called the song \"the quintessential Dandy Warhols moment to date\". In 2011, Robert Webb of The Independent called it \"a defining song of the last decade\".\nThe A.V. Club noted the various influences from \"retro\" music present in the song, including how the guitar intro seems to imitate that of 'Little Bitch' by The Specials as well as 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' by the Rolling Stones.\nThe music video for the song, directed by Taylor-Taylor, has been the subject of controversy and is rarely broadcast on television during the day, since it contains full-frontal male and topless female nudity. However, when played on some music channels, these areas are pixelated.\nThe video shows the band playing in a karaoke bar (actually the Slabtown bar in Portland, Oregon, closed in 2014) while many different people mime to the lyrics of the song. This is intercut with a video accompanying the lyrics on the television screen at the bar. In this video, the scenes correspond with the lyrics. In the first verse, a man approaches a young woman who is fixing a car (a hearse, actually) with her friends. They both flirtatiously sing the lyrics to each other as a sign of attraction. The man is so attracted to the woman that he stares at her lower body and then visualizes her naked. Then the video switches to a waiter while he is serving a group of customers at a table. One of the girls in the group is attracted to the waiter and the two begin to flirt and mime the lyrics to the second verse. She visualizes him naked. It then turns out that the waiter and the mechanic who was fixing the car live in the same \"pad\". From the lyrics in the third verse, it is likely that the waiter is the mechanic's ex-boyfriend, as the man she was flirting with earlier is also with her. While the mechanic and her new love interest exchange a look, the woman from the restaurant emerges from a curtain wearing a nightgown. She then takes the waiter's hand and pulls him away. The video ends with the characters from the video miming the lyrics in the karaoke bar along with many other people including a man spinning a hula hoop around his waist.\nThe song has been featured in several movies, including The Replacements, Summer Catch, Igby Goes Down, Clockstoppers, Flushed Away, Little Nicky, Foolproof, Delirious, and Man of the Year. Among the television series it has been featured on are Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Numb3rs, Six Feet Under, Daria, Fresh Meat, and Chuck. A very obvious variation of the song is used as the opening theme song for the American version of the game show Cash Cab. The song was also featured in season 7 of Dancing with the Stars for Cody Linley and Julianne Hough's tango performance. For many years it has been the theme music for the BBC Radio phone-in show 6-0-6. It has also been featured in the PlayStation game Test Drive Le Mans in 2000.\nIn 2006, a mashup between the song and \"Horny\" by Mousse T. was released as the single \"Horny as a Dandy\". It reached No. 17 on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe song was the subject of a minor controversy in 2011 when British conservative politician Theresa May played the song as she walked from a conference speech. It was initially speculated that the track was \"Rocks\" by Primal Scream, who posted a statement on their website condemning her \"inappropriate\" use of their song, calling her a \"legalised bully\" and \"the enemy\". After discovering the track was his, Dandy Warhols frontman Courtney"

The song was written by Brian Elliot with additional lyrics by Madonna, who produced it with Stephen Bray. The song also appears remixed on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and in its original form on the 2009 compilation album Celebration. The song's musical style combines pop and classical styling, and its lyrics deal with teenage pregnancy and the choices that come with it. It was based on teen gossip Elliot heard outside his recording studio.\nReleased as the album's second single in mid-1986, the song was a commercial success. It became Madonna's fourth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, and performed well internationally, reaching the top position in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was well received by music critics and was frequently cited as a highlight in the album. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's second image makeover, featuring her with a more toned and muscular body, and cropped platinum blonde hair. It portrayed a storyline where Madonna is trying to tell her father about her pregnancy. The images are juxtaposed with shots of Madonna dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio, and spending a romantic evening with her boyfriend.\nShortly after its release, the song caused heated discussions about its lyrical content. Women's organizations and others in the family planning field criticized Madonna for encouraging teenage pregnancy, while groups opposed to abortion saw the song as having a positive anti-abortion message. Madonna has performed \"Papa Don't Preach\" in five of her world tours, the latest being the Madame X Tour in 2019. The song also caused her first conflict with the Vatican, as she dedicated it to Pope John Paul II, who urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts during the Who's That Girl World Tour in 1987. In 2002, British singer Kelly Osbourne recorded a hard rock cover of the song. Osbourne's version was included as a bonus track on her debut album Shut Up.\nDuring the autumn of 1985, Madonna started writing and recording songs for her third studio album, True Blue. She brought back Steve Bray and hired a new producer, Patrick Leonard, to help her on the album. The album's first track \"Papa Don't Preach\", was written by Brian Elliot, who described it as \"a love song, maybe framed a little bit differently\". The song is based on teen gossip he heard outside his recording studio, which has a large front window that doubles as a mirror where schoolgirls from the North Hollywood High School in Los Angeles regularly stopped to fix their hair and chat. The song was sent to Madonna by Michael Ostin, the same Warner Bros. executive who discovered \"Like a Virgin\". Madonna only contributed with some additional lyrics, making \"Papa Don't Preach\" the only song on the album that she did not have a strong hand in writing. In a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna was asked by the interviewer Austin Scaggs as to why the theme of the song was meaningful to her. She replied saying,\n[The song] just fit right in with my own personal zeitgeist of standing up to male authorities, whether it's the pope, or the Catholic Church or my father and his conservative, patriarchal ways.\u00a0... For 'Papa Don't Preach' there were so many opinions\u00a0\u2013 that's why I thought it was so great. Is she for 'schma-smortion', as they say in Knocked Up? Is she against abortion?\n\"Papa Don't Preach\" is a dance-pop song with instrumentation from acoustic, electric, and rhythm guitars, keyboards, and string arrangements. It is set in common time, and moves at a moderate tempo of 116 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of F minor. The combination of key and tempo produces a disjuncture between pop and classical rhythms, underlined by the instrumentation during the introduction.\nThe song begins with a distinctly Vivaldian style, as the fast tempo and classical-style chord progression anticipates the lyrics to follow. The opening chords and the melody emphasize the tonic of the leading notes: Fm\u2013E\u266d\u2013D\u266d\u2013Cm\u2013D\u266d\u2013E\u266d\u2013Fm\u2013D\u266d\u2013E\u266d\u2013Fm, resembling a Baroque work. This is followed by the sound of dance music, produced by a powerful beat from the instruments. Madonna's vocal range spans from F\u2083 to C\u2085, and has a different sound from her previous work, more mature, centered, and with a lower range.\nThe lyrics show Madonna's interest in her Roman Catholic upbringing, as the song theme is about a girl who tells"

It was released as the lead single from True Blue on March 26, 1986, by Sire Records. Originally composed by Patrick Leonard for the score of the film Fire with Fire, the instrumental was shown to Madonna, who decided to use it for then-husband Sean Penn's film At Close Range. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, co-composed the melodies and co-produced it with Leonard. The song later appeared remixed on the compilation album The Immaculate Collection (1990), and in its original form on the compilation albums Something to Remember (1995) and Celebration (2009).\nA pop ballad, the song includes instrumentation from guitars, keyboards, drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deal with deceit, mistrust and childhood scars. It is also about being strong, which Madonna recalled in an interview that she thought about her relationship with her parents while writing the lyrics. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair, conservative wardrobe and subtle make-up. This toned down blond appearance was inspired by Marilyn Monroe, an actress and singer Madonna had previously been influenced by.\n\"Live to Tell\" was generally well received by music critics, who frequently referred to it as the best ballad of her discography. The song was also a commercial success, becoming Madonna's third number-one single on the US Billboard Hot 100 and her first number-one on the Adult Contemporary chart. In 2006, Madonna faced controversy when she performed it on her Confessions Tour wearing a crown of thorns while hanging on a giant mirrored cross. The performance at Rome's Olympic Stadium was condemned as an act of hostility toward the Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders.\nAfter Madonna finished The Virgin Tour, she asked producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray to write some songs with her and produce her third studio album, True Blue (1986). \"Live to Tell\" was originally an instrumental composed by Leonard for the score of Paramount's romantic drama film Fire with Fire. \"My managers represented the guy who was directing the film; it was his first film. I saw a little piece of the film, and I had the script. I wrote a theme and I said, 'What if I could get Madonna to write the lyrics for it?'\", said Leonard.\nHowever, Paramount rejected the track, believing that Leonard was incapable of creating the score for the film. Leonard later presented the instrumental to Madonna, who decided to use it for At Close Range, the new film starring her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, added some melodies, and composed the bridge. She recorded a demo of the song on a cassette and presented it to the film's director James Foley, who liked it and enlisted Leonard to compose the film's score, as suggested by Madonna.\nLeonard was working with Michael Jackson, on some transcriptions for his Bad album, when Penn called him to come to Foley's home. There he asked Leonard who would sing the track, since it was written from a man's perspective. Leonard, although he had initially envisioned a male voice interpreting the song, decided to use Madonna as the main vocalist and used the demo version as the main vocal with backup drums only. He later recalled that \"it was so innocent and so shy. It's as naive, as raw, as  raw can be and that's part of what gave it all its charm.\" In a 1986 interview, Madonna said that the mood on the song was inspired by a different facet of her image makeover and her desire to focus on something different.\n\"Live to Tell\" is a pop ballad, with background instrumentation from a keyboard, a synthesizer, a funk guitar and a mix of synthesized and real drumming. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song is written in the key of F major, is set in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute. The song starts with an instrumental introduction, performed by a synthesizer with the bass pedals set on D minor. Then the key suddenly changes to its relative major, F.\nMadonna's vocal range spans almost one octave from F\u2083 to D\u2084. As she begins to sing the first verse, the bass pedal changes to C major, changes back to F during the chorus, and back to D minor during the chorus closure. This"

The album was released with the intention of toning down the image of Madonna, who was being heavily criticized at the time. She wrote and produced the song with Canadian musician David Foster. \"You'll See\" was released on October 30, 1995, by Maverick Records as the lead single from the album. An acoustic pop ballad, \"You'll See\" features instrumentation from percussion, tremolo guitar and piano, while lyrically it speaks of independence after the end of a love affair.\nThe song received positive reception from contemporary critics, with reviewers praising Madonna's vocals. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) honored it as the Most Performed Song, in their annual ASCAP Pop Awards for 1997. \"You'll See\" was commercially successful, reaching the top five in Austria, Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom. The single also managed to peak at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 making it Madonna's 29th top-ten single on the chart.\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Michael Haussman, where the story line served as a sequel to Madonna's previous music video for \"Take a Bow\". An alternate Spanish version, written by Argentine singer-songwriter Paz Martinez, also received a music video, and was included on the Latin American edition of Something to Remember. Madonna has performed the song live on the British television program Top of the Pops and on selected US shows of her 2001 Drowned World Tour. In 2009, Scottish singer Susan Boyle included a cover of the song on her debut studio album I Dreamed a Dream.\nAfter a controversy-fueled period, Madonna's personal life had started to dominate over her musical career. \"She knew it was time to make a change\" as said by one anonymous member of her management team who claimed that she wanted to prove there was more to her than the constant media circus surrounding her. In November 1995, Madonna released a compilation album, Something to Remember, featuring a selection of her ballads over a decade of her career and three new songs; described as a \"love letter from Madonna to her fans and music lovers alike\" the compilation was targeted to emphasize the singer's musical abilities, and away from the theatrics. On the album's liner notes, Madonna further explained:\nSo much controversy has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs are all but forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate the idea of doing things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.\nFor the new songs, Madonna worked with David Foster, a well-known producer who had worked with the likes of Barbra Streisand, Al Jarreau and Earth, Wind & Fire. Foster initially did not expect Madonna would collaborate with him, as he believed that his music would not \"really [be] hip enough for her\". The recording session with Foster resulted in two new songs to the final track list, \"You'll See\" and \"One More Chance\". Foster commented: \"At the end of the day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, 'You'll See', was really great. Madonna had written a great lyric ('You think that I can't live without your love / You'll see') and I thought my music was great\". The track was produced and arranged by Madonna and Foster, who worked on the song during the third weekend of September 1995.\nRecording of the song was done in Brooklyn Studios and assisted by Ronnie Rivera. It was engineered and mixed by David Reitzas, who also produced the remix of \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" for Something to Remember. Simon Franglen provided synclavier programming for the song. Only three instruments were used for the song\u2014acoustic guitar played by Dean Parks, electric guitar played by Michael Thompson and keyboard played by Foster. A Spanish version of the song, titled \"Ver\u00e1s\", was recorded by Madonna at Gloria and Emilio Estefan's studio in Miami. The song was translated into Spanish by Paz Martinez and was included as a bonus track on the Latin American editions of Something to Remember. \"You'll See\" premiered on the radio forums of the official Warner Bros. Records' website on October 18, 1995 and was officially released"

It was released as the lead single from True Blue on March 26, 1986, by Sire Records. Originally composed by Patrick Leonard for the score of the film Fire with Fire, the instrumental was shown to Madonna, who decided to use it for then-husband Sean Penn's film At Close Range. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, co-composed the melodies and co-produced it with Leonard. The song later appeared remixed on the compilation album The Immaculate Collection (1990), and in its original form on the compilation albums Something to Remember (1995) and Celebration (2009).\nA pop ballad, the song includes instrumentation from guitars, keyboards, drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deal with deceit, mistrust and childhood scars. It is also about being strong, which Madonna recalled in an interview that she thought about her relationship with her parents while writing the lyrics. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair, conservative wardrobe and subtle make-up. This toned down blond appearance was inspired by Marilyn Monroe, an actress and singer Madonna had previously been influenced by.\n\"Live to Tell\" was generally well received by music critics, who frequently referred to it as the best ballad of her discography. The song was also a commercial success, becoming Madonna's third number-one single on the US Billboard Hot 100 and her first number-one on the Adult Contemporary chart. In 2006, Madonna faced controversy when she performed it on her Confessions Tour wearing a crown of thorns while hanging on a giant mirrored cross. The performance at Rome's Olympic Stadium was condemned as an act of hostility toward the Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders.\nAfter Madonna finished The Virgin Tour, she asked producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray to write some songs with her and produce her third studio album, True Blue (1986). \"Live to Tell\" was originally an instrumental composed by Leonard for the score of Paramount's romantic drama film Fire with Fire. \"My managers represented the guy who was directing the film; it was his first film. I saw a little piece of the film, and I had the script. I wrote a theme and I said, 'What if I could get Madonna to write the lyrics for it?'\", said Leonard.\nHowever, Paramount rejected the track, believing that Leonard was incapable of creating the score for the film. Leonard later presented the instrumental to Madonna, who decided to use it for At Close Range, the new film starring her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, added some melodies, and composed the bridge. She recorded a demo of the song on a cassette and presented it to the film's director James Foley, who liked it and enlisted Leonard to compose the film's score, as suggested by Madonna.\nLeonard was working with Michael Jackson, on some transcriptions for his Bad album, when Penn called him to come to Foley's home. There he asked Leonard who would sing the track, since it was written from a man's perspective. Leonard, although he had initially envisioned a male voice interpreting the song, decided to use Madonna as the main vocalist and used the demo version as the main vocal with backup drums only. He later recalled that \"it was so innocent and so shy. It's as naive, as raw, as  raw can be and that's part of what gave it all its charm.\" In a 1986 interview, Madonna said that the mood on the song was inspired by a different facet of her image makeover and her desire to focus on something different.\n\"Live to Tell\" is a pop ballad, with background instrumentation from a keyboard, a synthesizer, a funk guitar and a mix of synthesized and real drumming. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song is written in the key of F major, is set in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute. The song starts with an instrumental introduction, performed by a synthesizer with the bass pedals set on D minor. Then the key suddenly changes to its relative major, F.\nMadonna's vocal range spans almost one octave from F\u2083 to D\u2084. As she begins to sing the first verse, the bass pedal changes to C major, changes back to F during the chorus, and back to D minor during the chorus closure. This"

It was written by Sebastian and Ian Barter, who also produced the song. \"Get Along\" reached number 5 on the ARIA Singles Chart, the fourth top ten single released from \"Armageddon\". It is also Sebastian's 11th top ten single in Australia, and ninth to peak in the top five. \"Get Along\" has been certified 3\u00d7 platinum. \"Get Along\" also reached number nine and gold certification in New Zealand. The song was a finalist in the Pop/Top 40 category of the 2013 International Songwriting Competition, and was also one of the final five nominees for the APRA Song of the Year Award. It was also nominated for Song of the Year in the 2013 ARIA Awards.\n\"Get Along\" is a song which deals with the damage inflicted by religious, cultural and racial intolerance. It is a stripped back pop ballad with minimal instrumental accompaniment. Sebastian said that in the lead up to the birth of his first child in early 2012 he began analysing the world his son would grow up in. He explained that while he had always taken notice of the state of world affairs, he had never written about it in song, as he had never felt it was his position or role \"to put it to paper as a songwriter\". Sebastian said, \"It sends your brain into overload when you are expecting your first child. It definitely makes you take a step back to try to gain some perspective on this world we live in. This song tries to encapsulate that. The hunger for eutopia, that perfect world where everyone just accepts people. Obviously that's not a world we currently live in, and not a world my son has inherited.\" Sebastian says he started thinking about \"why it is that we live in such a tumultuous world that is so full of beauty, but on the flipside also just so full of hate\". He said it is his favourite song he has written, and that he is proud of its message that if people were more accepting of different religions, cultures and races the world could be a better place. He added, \"Just this year Rodney King died and his whole slogan I guess was 'Can we all get along'.\"\n\"Get Along\" was serviced to radio in the first week of November 2012, and was the most added song to Australian radio in its first week. It reached number 24 on the National Airplay Chart in its first full week of radio play. The song is currently only available to download from the album as no individual single has been released as yet. Sebastian performed \"Get Along\" on the Seven Network's morning program Sunrise on 12 November, and also on the first night of the 2012 X Factor Grand Final on 19 November.\n\n\"Get Along\" has received positive reviews. Jamie Horne, music journalist for the Border Mail called the song \"inspiring\" and said it was \"a lyrical triumph.\" Take 40 wrote, \"It really shows the beautiful timbre of his voice, and has a very inspiring message.\" Cameron Adams from the Herald Sun said Sebastian's songwriting had matured and that he showed new depth with \"Get Along\". Music site auspOp wrote, \"This one is designed to get you thinking. To tap into your emotions. 'Get Along' is a song about hope, peace and understanding and a dream that perhaps one day we'll all be united, together as one people, one world, despite our differences in opinion, religion, creed and race. [...] Good on Guy for shining some light and spreading the love.\" David Lim, a music journalist and announcer on radio station Joy 94.9, wrote, \"\"The emotive political ballad 'Get Along' is possibly the best single Sebastian has ever released. I just can't get over how great his observant lyrics about religious wars are. The hook - 'Dear God, dear soul, dear Mary, Mohammed... can we all just get along?' - absolutely rips right through the heart. Jessica Tisdell from music site Novastreamusic said, \"The lyrics are definitely heart-warming and send a great message to humanity. You can almost tell that Guy's song writing has matured and focuses more on real life rather than recent dance pop songs.\"\n\"Get Along\" debuted at number thirty-four on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart before ascending to number-five the following week, becoming Sebastian's fourth top ten single from \"Armageddon\".  It is also Sebastian's 11th top ten single in Australia and his ninth to peak in the top five. Although only released in mid November it was the 12th highest selling Australian artist single in Australia in 2012. It achieved triple platinum certificatio and charted at"

It was released as the second single from the album. The song peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming his highest charted single since his digital cover version of \"Mad World\". The song charted within the top 10 of the charts in thirteen countries.\nThe pop rock song was written by Pink, Max Martin, and Shellback and was recorded by Pink for her fifth studio album, Funhouse, but did not make it to the final cut. Lambert's vocal performance of the song received a Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.\nThe song was included on the set list of Lambert's first concert tour, the 2010 Glam Nation Tour where he performed an acoustic rendition of it during the \"ballad\" section of the show. The song is also featured as one of the numbers in the 2019 jukebox musical & Juliet.\nThe track was originally recorded and co-written by Pink for the album Funhouse but did not make the final cut. On November 18, 2009, Lambert announced via his official website that his second single from his debut album would be \"Whataya Want from Me\". The song was the second single announced before the CD was officially available to the public. The song became available as a legal download in the United States on November 20, 2009, when the album was officially released.\nIn 2010, Pink's recording appeared exclusively on the German and Australian releases of her first greatest hits compilation album, Greatest Hits... So Far!!!.\n\"Whataya Want from Me\" has received generally favorable reviews. Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine praised the song and called it \"phenomenally well-crafted pop single(s) that give Lambert the opportunity to shine\". In the Houston Chronicle, Joey Guerra wrote that the song \"...[is] probably the disc's most straightforward cut, with a bit of a Backstreet Boys vibe. Not bad\". Huffington Post noted that this song deploys \"some tired pop cliches\" in the chorus but continued praising \"one of the album's more poignant emotional statements, anticipating the heavy burden of expectations the singer is likely to carry while expressing vulnerable appreciation for the acceptance he has received.\" AllMusic called this song \"terrific pop tune\" and \"P!nk's pained [song]\". Entertainment Weekly was also positive by calling it \"hooky, heartfelt lament\". Detroit News wrote \"Credit Team Lambert for pairing him with a host of top-notch, like-minded collaborators\" including Pink. LA Times praised that singing is \"pleading and soulful.\" On the other hand, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune disliked the song and wrote \"Lambert throws his hands up in the whiny 'Whataya Want from Me', a trifle from the team of Pink and Britney Spears svengali Martin.\" This song took 22nd place on \"Top 100 'American Idol' Hits of All Time\" by Billboard.\n\"Whataya Want from Me\" debuted at number 72 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 on the week of January 2, 2010. Following his appearance as a mentor on American Idol (season 9), the song reached number ten, becoming Lambert's second Top 20 single (the first being his cover of \"Mad World\", which peaked at number nineteen) and first Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100. As of January 2014, the single had sold approximately 2,006,000 copies within the US.\nThe song is the only Adam Lambert song to appear in the Billboard Year-end, ranking at number forty-five in 2010.\nTo promote the album's release, several songs from the album were performed live on AOL Sessions \u2013 including \"Whataya Want from Me\".  Following Lambert's American Music Awards of 2009 performance of \"For Your Entertainment\", Lambert was dropped from a few upcoming performances and shows, including Good Morning America and Jimmy Kimmel Live!  Lambert started a very long string of interviews and performances to address the controversy and promote his new single.\n\"Whataya Want from Me\" made its live debut on CBS's The Early Show on November 25, 2009.  He performed two songs, and did a live interview discussing his performance at the American Music Awards that caused much controversy.  In addition to \"Whataya Want from Me\", he performed \"Music Again\". His appearance on the morning show drew fans from all over the world to come watch him live.\nLambert"

The song was written by Chris DeStefano, Brett James and Priscilla Renea. It was released as the second single from Lambert's fifth studio album Platinum in advance of the album's release two weeks later. The song premiered at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards on May 18, 2014, and was released for sale the next day.\n\"Somethin' Bad\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs, becoming Underwood's thirteenth number one on the chart and Lambert's fifth.

The song was originally intended to be a male/female duet, but was later tweaked so that it could be performed by two females.\nThe song is seen as a female take on the bro-country genre. According to Lambert, when she heard \"Somethin\u2019 Bad\", \"the song just popped,\" and it \"really struck a chord.\"  Lambert said she had wanted to do a duet with Carrie Underwood, and that \"It's been too long since two girls in our genre have come together like that, especially on a song that's kind of in your face.\" She sent Underwood an email to request a collaboration, which was accepted as they had wanted to sing together for some time.\nThe song made its debut on the 2014 Billboard Music Awards on May 18, 2014 with a performance by Lambert and Underwood. They performed the song again at the CMT Music Awards on June 4, 2014.\nThe song received generally favorable response from the critics.  Matt Bjorke of Roughstock thought the song playful, fun, and \"sure to be a fast-selling hit.\" Jason Scott of AXS called it \"a fun, beat-driven summer anthem\" and rated it four stars out of five. Taste of Country said that the song's \"ready-for-anything lyrics and the way that Lambert and Underwood belt them out with such power, make \u2018Somethin\u2019 Bad\u2019 a catchy girl-power anthem.\"\n\"Somethin' Bad\" debuted at No. 39 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart following its release for sales on May 19, 2014 (chart dated June 7, 2014).  The song debuted at No. 48 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart for the same week, before it was officially released to radio on June 16, 2014. The song also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Digital Songs chart, with 107,000 downloads sold in its first week. \"Somethin' Bad\" peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in its sixth week, becoming Underwood's 13th number one on the chart and Lambert's fifth. The same week, the song jumped to No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lambert's highest peaking song to date on that chart. It is the first No. 1 by teamed-up solo women in more than two decades on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. As of April 2015, the song has sold 1,080,000 copies in the United States.\nIn Canada, the song debuted at No. 33 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart following its first week of release.\nThe music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy and released on June 25, 2014. It features Lambert as Belle Boyd and Underwood as  Priscilla Parker, a pair of jewel thieves.  The video is presented as a trailer for a film where the pair play poker, ride Indian motorcycles and engage in a jewel heist in which they flee in a luxury Bell Helicopter.\nMiranda purchased the two Indian Motorcycles keeping one for herself, while giving the other to Carrie as a \"thank you\" for doing the song with her. Carrie tweeted a pic of her on the bike. The bikes and the helicopter were part of a product placement arrangement organized by CMS Nashville.\nAs of November 2019, the music video has accumulated over 109 million views on Vevo and was nominated for a 2014 CMA for \"Video of the Year.\"\nIn June 2016, NBC Sports announced that \"Somethin' Bad\" would form the basis of Underwood's new theme for NBC Sunday Night Football starting with the 2016 NFL season.

The song became available as a legal download in the United States on November 20, 2009, when the album was officially released.\nIn 2010, Pink's recording appeared exclusively on the German and Australian releases of her first greatest hits compilation album, Greatest Hits... So Far!!!.\n\"Whataya Want from Me\" has received generally favorable reviews. Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine praised the song and called it \"phenomenally well-crafted pop single(s) that give Lambert the opportunity to shine\". In the Houston Chronicle, Joey Guerra wrote that the song \"...[is] probably the disc's most straightforward cut, with a bit of a Backstreet Boys vibe. Not bad\". Huffington Post noted that this song deploys \"some tired pop cliches\" in the chorus but continued praising \"one of the album's more poignant emotional statements, anticipating the heavy burden of expectations the singer is likely to carry while expressing vulnerable appreciation for the acceptance he has received.\" AllMusic called this song \"terrific pop tune\" and \"P!nk's pained [song]\". Entertainment Weekly was also positive by calling it \"hooky, heartfelt lament\". Detroit News wrote \"Credit Team Lambert for pairing him with a host of top-notch, like-minded collaborators\" including Pink. LA Times praised that singing is \"pleading and soulful.\" On the other hand, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune disliked the song and wrote \"Lambert throws his hands up in the whiny 'Whataya Want from Me', a trifle from the team of Pink and Britney Spears svengali Martin.\" This song took 22nd place on \"Top 100 'American Idol' Hits of All Time\" by Billboard.\n\"Whataya Want from Me\" debuted at number 72 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 on the week of January 2, 2010. Following his appearance as a mentor on American Idol (season 9), the song reached number ten, becoming Lambert's second Top 20 single (the first being his cover of \"Mad World\", which peaked at number nineteen) and first Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100. As of January 2014, the single had sold approximately 2,006,000 copies within the US.\nThe song is the only Adam Lambert song to appear in the Billboard Year-end, ranking at number forty-five in 2010.\nTo promote the album's release, several songs from the album were performed live on AOL Sessions \u2013 including \"Whataya Want from Me\".  Following Lambert's American Music Awards of 2009 performance of \"For Your Entertainment\", Lambert was dropped from a few upcoming performances and shows, including Good Morning America and Jimmy Kimmel Live!  Lambert started a very long string of interviews and performances to address the controversy and promote his new single.\n\"Whataya Want from Me\" made its live debut on CBS's The Early Show on November 25, 2009.  He performed two songs, and did a live interview discussing his performance at the American Music Awards that caused much controversy.  In addition to \"Whataya Want from Me\", he performed \"Music Again\". His appearance on the morning show drew fans from all over the world to come watch him live.\nLambert"

It appeared as a bonus track on The Script's self-titled debut studio album, and a B-side for some of the album's singles. It is better known for being performed by American recording artist Kris Allen. The song serves as the lead single from his self-titled major label debut album. It was released for digital download on September 21, 2009.\nThe song received positive reviews, peaking at eighteen in the United States, and charting on other U.S. charts, including the top ten of the Pop Songs. It also charted abroad in Canada and New Zealand. The song's accompanying music video, which takes place in a desert and features a countdown clock in conjunction with the song's meaning, was received warmly, and according to critics, was an end to the low-budget, storyline-centered, debut music videos from previous American Idol alumni.\nThe song had been recorded by Irish band The Script as a bonus track for the Japanese release of their self-titled debut album and a B-side track for their debut single \"We Cry\" in Australia, Finland, Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland.\nIn an interview with MTV News, Allen stated that the song had been earmarked as his album's potential single since he won American Idol back in May 2009. Allen stated, \"[The song] was actually one that we had listened to really early on, and we kind of just fell in love with it. Everyone did.\" When an interview for his cover story shared with, Idol runner-up, Adam Lambert, Allen explained, \"It's a song that has a really good message-that we only have so much time, let's make the most of it. It's definitely got one of the choruses where I can picture people rolling down the windows of their cars and singing along to it.\"\n\nAfter the success of the single, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Allen said, \n\"It took a while, but it\u2019s done really incredible. It exceeded all my expectations anyway. To be honest, I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn\u2019t doing great. But I think it\u2019s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I\u2019m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn\u2019t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that\u2019s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that\u2019s a testament to a good song. You don\u2019t have to love \u2018em the first time you hear \u2018em. It grew on people.\"\n\"Live Like We're Dying\" is described to be in a \"moderate pop rock\" groove, and consisting of \"shuffly\" guitar playing. The song has been referred to as \"danceable\", and the chorus as \"grooving\" and \"syncopated\". It is written in the key of C major and Allen's vocals span from G\u2083 to A\u2084. The song contains inspirational lyrics, as Allen gives a \"muscular\" and \"engaged\" vocal performance, and delivers the lines in a rhythmic fashion. According to Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly, the song contains new-age sentiments.\nBill Lamb of About.com praised the song for being an excellent first single, calling it \"possibly the best first post-American Idol single yet by an American Idol champion\" and stating that it \"could appeal to a massive audience\".  He also applauded the song's \"outstanding, inspirational lyrics\" and Allen's vocal performance. Entertainment Weekly''s Michael Slezak called the song \"a future smash hit\" and described it as \"downright verbose \u2013 packing in some sweet, new-age-y sentiments about existing in the moment, living without regret, and saying 'I love you' early and often to the people in our lives\".  He stated that rather than being clich\u00e9 the song's lyrics are \"winningly inspirational thanks to the conviction in Kris\u2019 vocals\".  Yahoo! News described it as \"impressive\" and felt that Allen's version of the song \"improves on the unreleased version with a nuanced vocal and a nimble, rhythmic delivery\".  Monica Herrera of Billboard said that Allen \"improves\" the Script's version \"with a nuanced vocal and a nimble, rhythmic delivery\". Herrera also stated that \"Allen still seems \"emboldened by the risks he took on Idol\" and that his fans \"should be feeling the same after hearing the first track from his November 17 debut.\"\nJames Montgomery of MTV News said that the song seemed \"tailor-made\" for him, playing on the strengths"

It was released on May 25, 2018, to radio stations through Atlantic Records as the fourth single from her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy (2018). \"I Like It\" is a Latin trap song that comprises a trap drum beat and salsa music. It was written by the three performers along with Jordan Thorpe and Klenord Raphael, while the production was handled by J. White Did It, Tainy, Craig Kallman and Invincible. The song contains a sample from \"I Like It Like That\", replayed by musicians during production, with Tony Pab\u00f3n, Manny Rodriguez, and Benny Bonnilla being credited as co-writers.\nWork on the song took from October 2017 to early April 2018. Its music video was filmed in Little Havana, Miami and has received more than 1.3 billion views. The single topped the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Cardi B's second number one\u2014the first time a female rapper achieved this in the chart's history, and the first for both Bad Bunny and J Balvin. It also reached the top 10 in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Critically acclaimed, Billboard staff, Los Angeles Times, and Apple Music's editorial selection ranked it as the best song of the year, while Rolling Stone named it \"the best summer song of all time.\"\n\"I Like It\" was nominated for Record of the Year at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. It became the first song led by a female rapper to surpass a billion streams on Spotify, also making Cardi B the first woman in hip hop with a pair of billion-streamers on the service, joining her collaboration \"Girls Like You\". \"I Like It\" is the highest-ranked song led by a female rapper on the Billboard Hot 100 decade-end chart for the 2010s. It was certified nine times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2020, becoming the second-highest-certified single by a female rapper, following the Diamond-certified \"Bodak Yellow\". As of 2021, it is the most-streamed song by a female rapper in the UK.\nDuring the recording sessions of Invasion of Privacy, Cardi and her team were listening to beats and song ideas. Craig Kallman wanted to include a track that pays homage to her Latin heritage and searched among his Latin music collection of records that he used to play when he was a DJ. Decided for Pete Rodriguez's \"I Like It Like That\" and \"Oh That's Nice\", he added J. White to the production process. The sample of the former song \"over a very rough instrumental\" and with a Cardi verse on it was sent to musician Edgar Machuca. White and Machuca worked on the production, chopping up the sample and trying to \"make the song sound better and cohesive and beef up the production.\" Cardi re-wrote the hook a number of times and cut vocals, eventually choosing the chorus she was most comfortable with. The three producers looped the \"I Like It\" part as they felt that was the catchiest part of the sample. Machuca proposed to add Bad Bunny and J Balvin to the track, with both artists contributing with their verses and ideas. Tainy and Invicible finished working on the production focusing on the instrumentals. Work on the record started in October 2017, and finished in early April 2018.\n\"I Like It\" is a Latin trap song. It is a blend of trap and salsa, and interpolates 1967 boogaloo song \"I Like It Like That\". By replaying the sample instead of using the physical sample, its owners receive compensation and credit for their composition, with production saving money and retaining publishing ownership. As noted by a Billboard editor, the song is \"heavily indebted to the world of Latin hip hop.\" Bad Bunny raps in English and Spanish, while J Balvin performs in Spanish.\n\"I Like It\" received critical acclaim. Writing for Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos deemed it \"the song of the summer\" and commented \"[it] sounds like it was chemically concocted in a mad scientist's lab to be 2018's reigning song of the summer. [...] Everything about this song is perfect for summer: the trap-meets-salsa beat, features from two of reggaeton's biggest stars, a sample of Pete Rodriguez's"

It was released by LaFace Records and Arista Records as the lead single from Usher's second studio album, My Way on August 5, 1997. \"You Make Me Wanna...\" was written by Usher along with Jermaine Dupri and Manuel Seal, who both produced the tune. An R&B, soul and pop song in C minor, it makes use of acoustic guitar, hi-hat and bell instrumentation. The song focuses on a love triangle relationship, with the protagonist wishing to leave his girlfriend for his erstwhile best friend, with a hook in which Usher states, \"You make me wanna leave the one I'm with and start a new relationship with you\". The record won a Billboard Music Award, a Soul Train Music Award, and a WQHT Hip Hop Award, and was nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\" appeared on several record charts, topping the UK Singles Chart and the US Hot R&B Singles, logging the second-longest run by a male artist on the latter. It also reached the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100, US Pop Songs, Canadian Singles Chart, Dutch Top 40 and ARIA Singles Chart. An accompanying music video, directed by Bille Woodruff, shows Usher dancing in various colored rooms and backgrounds, and uses an effect which creates several clones of Usher.\nUsher wrote \"You Make Me Wanna...\" with Jermaine Dupri and Manuel Seal, who also produced and played musical instruments on the tune. Phil Tan was in charge of recording the song at the Krosswire Studio, in Atlanta, Georgia in 1996. Tan and Dupri mixed the record with assistance from John and Brian Frye at Studio LaCoCo, in Atlanta, Georgia. \"You Make Me Wanna...\" draws from the genres of R&B, soul and pop, and heavily utilizes the acoustic guitar, while also incorporating hi-hat and bell instrumentation. According to Universal Music Publishing Group's sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, \"You Make Me Wanna...\" is written in the key of C Minor with a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute. Usher's voice extends from the low note of B\u266d\u2083 to the high note of C\u2086. The song has a basic sequence of Cm\u2013Fm\u2087\u2013A\u266d\u2013G\u2013G/B as its chord progression. In the song, Usher attempts to seduce his partner's best friend, whom he finds irresistible, creating a love triangle. The song's lyrics are written in second-person narrative, and its hook is the pick-up line, \"You make me wanna leave the one I'm with and start a new relationship with you\". Usher told Rolling Stone that the song was inspired by one of his own memories of \"juggling three women\".\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\" was distributed by LaFace Records and Arista Records. In the United States, it was serviced to rhythmic contemporary radio on July 15, 1997. The song was then released via maxi single on August 5, 1997. On September 9, 1997, the track was added to US contemporary hit radio. \"You Make Me Wanna...\" was released via cassette single, CD single, and 12-inch vinyl in the UK on January 19, 1998. The vinyl was made available in the US on April 24, 2001. Unauthorized copies of the song were distributed in Europe before its release, due to its popularity. \"You Make Me Wanna...\" serves as the opening track to Usher's second studio album, My Way, while an extended version concludes the album.\nBillboard wrote, \"Vocally strumming his notes as gently and powerfully as the guitar player who accompanies him, Usher makes no enemies by professing an attraction to a friend while being involved with another. The track promises to be a hit among all generations and genders as his loyal young female fan base will eagerly jump aboard.

Entertainment Weekly's Whitney Pastorek gave the song an A- rating, and complimented its minimal production. According to Ann Powers of The New York Times, the song \"put the spice back in the word 'relationship'.\" A writer for The Vindicator wrote, \"The song is a melodic blend of Usher's smooth, youthful voice and a strong, upbeat rhythm track. Billy Johnson Jr. of Yahoo! Music commended the production on \"You Make Me Wanna...\", along with that of \"Nice and Slow\" and \"My Way\", the second and third singles from My Way, respectively.

The song was produced by Dupri and Cox for Usher's fourth studio album, Confessions (2004).  Originally planned as the album's lead single, \"Burn\" was pushed back after favorable responses for the song \"Yeah!\". \"Burn\" was released as the second single from the album on March 21, 2004.\n\"Burn\" topped various charts around the world, including the Billboard Hot 100 for eight non-consecutive weeks; it succeeded \"Yeah!\" at number one.  Both singles gave Usher nineteen consecutive weeks at the top spot, longer than any solo artist of the Hot 100 era. \"Burn\" was certified platinum in Australia and United States, and gold in New Zealand. The song was well received by critics and garnered award nominations. In 2009 it was named the 21st most successful song of the 2000s, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. This song won the 2005 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Song.\nWhen Usher planned to make a new record after his third album, 8701 (2001), he decided to not branch out much with collaborators and continue building music with his previous producers. Usher again enlisted record-producer Jermaine Dupri, who had collaborated on his two previous albums, along with The Neptunes and R. Kelly, among others, to work on his fourth studio album, Confessions (2004). Dupri contacted his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox, who had also made hits like the 2001 single \"U Got It Bad\" for Usher. During an early session for the album, Dupri and Cox talked about a situation which later became \"Burn\". At that time, Usher's two-year relationship with TLC's Chilli was flaming out. They said, \"Yo, you gotta let that burn\u00a0... That's a song right there\", and started writing.\nUsher submitted the album to his label Arista Records after he felt it was completed. After he and the company's then-president Antonio \"LA\" Reid listened to the songs, they felt the album needed a first single and that they needed to create one or two more songs, which caused the album's release to be postponed. Usher went back to the studio and collaborated with Lil Jon, who said, \"He needed a single. They had 'Burn,' 'Burn' was hot, but they needed that first powerful monster. That's when I came in.\" They worked on few more tracks, including \"Red Light\", which was not included in the first release of the album, and \"Yeah!\", which features Ludacris and Lil Jon.\nLabel personnel were undecided as to what to consider as the lead single. Reid was considering whether \"Yeah!\" would be released then, being as they also had \"Burn\". Usher was doubtful if the former was the right choice, after he wanted an R&B record. Until \"Yeah!\" was leaked, \"Burn\" was chosen as the official first single from Confessions. \"Yeah!\", which was intended as a promotional song and a teaser for Usher's fans, was released to street DJs and mixtapes. However, the favorable response to the song led to a change; \"Yeah!\" was the lead single and \"Burn\" was set as its follow-up. \"Burn\" was released in the United States on March 21, 2004, as a CD single, digital download, and 7-inch single. In the United Kingdom, a CD and 12-inch single were issued on June 28, 2004.\nUsher decided about the new material \"to let it all hang out by singing about some of his own little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets.\" The public speculated that  he was referring to his recent personal struggles, on which he promised a \"real talk\".\nIn early 2004, Usher broke up with Chilli due to \"irreconcilable differences and because they found it almost impossible to make compromises.\" Usher said in an interview: \"It's unfortunate when you have to let a situation go because it's not working\", which added reference to the breakup. It was later revealed that Chilli in fact broke up with Usher because of cheating, and the media said otherwise because of the lyrics in the song, which was not based on their relationship. Dupri, however, confessed that his personal life is the real story of the album. Usher said he took inspiration collectively by looking at his friends' personal situations.\n\"Burn\" is a slow jam  R&B ballad. The song is performed with a moderate groove. It is composed in the key of D-flat major. The melody line of the song has influences from \"Ignition (Remix)\" by R. Kelly. \"Burn\" has a combination of robotic noises, synthesized strings and guitar lines.\nThe lyrics are constructed in the traditional verse-chorus form. The song starts with a spoken intro, giving way to the first"

Written by Usher, Dupri and Cox, the song is a confession of a man to his woman about his impregnated mistress. This is a continuation of \"Confessions Part I\" which relates to a man's infidelity. Its personal content evoked rumors and early responses from the public even before its release, believing that Usher was asserting the truth; however, Dupri divulged that the story behind the album is about himself.\n\"Confessions Part II\" received mixed reviews from critics. The song was released as the third single from the album, following the success of \"Burn\".  The single reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, becoming the album's third consecutive number-one single. Internationally, the single had lesser success than the album's previous releases.\nWhen he started working on his fourth studio album Confessions after the release of his 2001 album 8701, Usher chose not to branch out much with musical collaborators; instead, he chose to continue creating music with his previous producers. He again enlisted producer-songwriter Jermaine Dupri, who had produced songs for Usher's two previous albums. Dupri approached Bryan-Michael Cox, asking him to become a collaborator. Cox has been a frequent partner of Dupri who had produced hits for Usher as well. Like \"Burn\", the second single from the album, Dupri and Cox conversed about a situation, creating the idea of the prospective song. However, they were concerned because they needed somebody to write such a song and they never thought Usher would do it. The concept became \"Confessions\".\nUsher started recording the song in July 2003 in New York City. One day, before the night was over, Usher was singing about impregnating a mistress and becoming displeased, having found that she is three months pregnant. The theme of cheating inspired him and Dupri, and they then decided to produce two parts of \"Confessions\": Part I and Part II. Usher said that the former is a \"dramatization where a guy confesses all the stuff he's been doing\" against his woman. The latter speaks of impregnating a mistress.\nWhile Confessions was still in production, Usher promised \"real talk\" in it. He decided \"to let it all hang out by singing about some of his own little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets.\" He explained: \"All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of.\"  He further noted that, for the most part, the album's subject matter is \"very personal\". Dupri expected people to question some of the personal lyrics they associated in the song.\n\"Confessions Part II\" was released as the third single from the album, following \"Burn\". The single was released in the United States as a 12-inch single on August 24, 2004. It was released in Germany on October 18, and Australia on October 26, 2004, featuring the album and remix version of the track and a song called \"Whatever I Want\". In the United Kingdom, it was issued as a double A-side with \"My Boo\", the fourth single from the album. The single was released in the country on November 1, 2004.\nUsher held few listening parties for the album prior to its release. Shortly after, people came up with different interpretations of \"Confessions Part II\", among other personal songs in the album. In 2003, Usher's two-year relationship with TLC's Chilli was going to \"flame-out\", which partly contributed to the concept of  \"Burn\". They finally broke up early in 2004 because of \"irreconcilable differences and because the two found it almost impossible to make compromises\" which partly triggered public speculation that some of the songs in the album are in reference to his personal struggle. They referred to the song speaking about Usher's \"infidelity\" to Chilli.\nAlongside the \"cheating\" rumors, the public inferred from the lyrics that Usher had impregnated a mistress in real life. Usher, however, emphasized that he was not in a relationship or \"got another girl pregnant\" and he was singing a \"character\". The similarity of situations he faced before and experiences of his friends collectively inspired him to write the song. In the middle of rumors, Dupri admitted that the stories behind the songs in the"

It was released by LaFace Records and Arista Records as the lead single from Usher's second studio album, My Way on August 5, 1997. \"You Make Me Wanna...\" was written by Usher along with Jermaine Dupri and Manuel Seal, who both produced the tune. An R&B, soul and pop song in C minor, it makes use of acoustic guitar, hi-hat and bell instrumentation. The song focuses on a love triangle relationship, with the protagonist wishing to leave his girlfriend for his erstwhile best friend, with a hook in which Usher states, \"You make me wanna leave the one I'm with and start a new relationship with you\". The record won a Billboard Music Award, a Soul Train Music Award, and a WQHT Hip Hop Award, and was nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\" appeared on several record charts, topping the UK Singles Chart and the US Hot R&B Singles, logging the second-longest run by a male artist on the latter. It also reached the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100, US Pop Songs, Canadian Singles Chart, Dutch Top 40 and ARIA Singles Chart. An accompanying music video, directed by Bille Woodruff, shows Usher dancing in various colored rooms and backgrounds, and uses an effect which creates several clones of Usher.\nUsher wrote \"You Make Me Wanna...\" with Jermaine Dupri and Manuel Seal, who also produced and played musical instruments on the tune. Phil Tan was in charge of recording the song at the Krosswire Studio, in Atlanta, Georgia in 1996. Tan and Dupri mixed the record with assistance from John and Brian Frye at Studio LaCoCo, in Atlanta, Georgia. \"You Make Me Wanna...\" draws from the genres of R&B, soul and pop, and heavily utilizes the acoustic guitar, while also incorporating hi-hat and bell instrumentation. According to Universal Music Publishing Group's sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, \"You Make Me Wanna...\" is written in the key of C Minor with a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute. Usher's voice extends from the low note of B\u266d\u2083 to the high note of C\u2086. The song has a basic sequence of Cm\u2013Fm\u2087\u2013A\u266d\u2013G\u2013G/B as its chord progression. In the song, Usher attempts to seduce his partner's best friend, whom he finds irresistible, creating a love triangle. The song's lyrics are written in second-person narrative, and its hook is the pick-up line, \"You make me wanna leave the one I'm with and start a new relationship with you\". Usher told Rolling Stone that the song was inspired by one of his own memories of \"juggling three women\".\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\" was distributed by LaFace Records and Arista Records. In the United States, it was serviced to rhythmic contemporary radio on July 15, 1997. The song was then released via maxi single on August 5, 1997. On September 9, 1997, the track was added to US contemporary hit radio. \"You Make Me Wanna...\" was released via cassette single, CD single, and 12-inch vinyl in the UK on January 19, 1998. The vinyl was made available in the US on April 24, 2001. Unauthorized copies of the song were distributed in Europe before its release, due to its popularity. \"You Make Me Wanna...\" serves as the opening track to Usher's second studio album, My Way, while an extended version concludes the album.\nBillboard wrote, \"Vocally strumming his notes as gently and powerfully as the guitar player who accompanies him, Usher makes no enemies by professing an attraction to a friend while being involved with another. The track promises to be a hit among all generations and genders as his loyal young female fan base will eagerly jump aboard. Older women will easily fall prey to the very thought of his musings, while men now have an interesting avenue to express similar feelings.\" Robert Christgau noted \"You Make Me Wanna...\" as one of the best tracks from My Way.

It is the fourth song on the band's third and final studio album, In Utero, released in September 1993. It is also Nirvana's last single release before Cobain committed suicide in 1994.\n\"Rape Me\" was released as the album's second single in December 1993, packaged as a double A-side with \"All Apologies\". The single reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\"Rape Me\" was written by Cobain on an acoustic guitar in Los Angeles in May 1991, around the time the band's second album, Nevermind, was being mixed. It was first performed live on June 18, 1991, at The Catalyst in Santa Cruz. The earliest live versions of the song featured a guitar solo instead of a bridge.\nThe song's lyrics led to controversy even before it had been officially released. The band had wanted to play \"Rape Me\" during their appearance at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, but the network believed the song was a direct attack on them, and insisted they perform their breakthrough single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" instead. The ongoing argument between MTV and Cobain escalated over the span of several days, with MTV threatening to cut Nirvana from the show, to stop playing the band's music videos, and even to boycott other artists on the band's management company, Gold Mountain. Cobain only relented after being informed that MTV would fire Amy Finnerty, an MTV employee and friend of the band's, if the band played \"Rape Me\". The band ultimately agreed to play their latest single, \"Lithium,\" but not before Cobain started playing the chords and singing the opening lines of \"Rape Me,\" which resulted in the live broadcast almost going to commercial.\n\"Rape Me\" was first recorded in the studio in October 1992, during a two-day demo session with Jack Endino at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington. Two takes of the song were recorded, one of which was instrumental, the other featuring lead vocals by Cobain and backing vocals by drummer Dave Grohl. Cobain was holding his then-infant daughter Frances Bean Cobain on his lap when he recorded his vocals, and she can be heard crying on the demo.\nThe final studio version of \"Rape Me\" was recorded in February 1993 by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, for the band's third and final studio album, In Utero. The instruments for the song were recorded on February 15. The following day, Cobain completed his vocals for the album during a reported six-hour session. Cobain used his Fender Jaguar guitar plugged into a Twin Reverb amp.\nOn September 25, 1993, the band performed the song, along with \"Heart-Shaped Box,\" on Saturday Night Live at NBC Studios in New York City. It was the band's first show with second guitarist Pat Smear. The song was again performed on television on February 4, 1994 for the show Nulle Part Ailleurs in Paris, France.\nThe final live performance of \"Rape Me\" was at Nirvana's last concert at Terminal 1 of Munich-Riem Airport on March 1, 1994.\n\nThe song's instrumental opening bars, which features Cobain using pick scratching while playing the verse chord progression, has led to frequent comparisons to the guitar riff of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Will Bryant of Pitchfork wrote that \"the four-chord riff that drags the song through the motions is an almost direct inversion of the famous 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' riff,\" while Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross described the song as having \"the same catchy soft/loud dynamic as \"Teen Spirit,\" which \"created a perfect Cobain aesthetic \u2013 beautiful, haunting and disturbing.\" \"Rape Me\" was written after \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" but before Nevermind had been released.\n\"Rape Me\" is an anti-rape song, written from the point of view of the victim. \"It's like she's saying, 'Rape me, go ahead, rape me, beat me,'\" Cobain told Darcey Steinke of Spin in 1993, \"'You'll never kill me. I'll survive this and I'm gonna fucking rape you one of these days and you won't even know it.'\" Gillian G. Garr described the song's lyrics as \"part submissive invitation, part"

It was released by Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records as the second single from the album on April 6, 2018, along with its music video. The song was produced by Murda Beatz, Noah \"40\" Shebib and Corey Litwin with co-production handled by Blaqnmild. It features additional vocals by Big Freedia and 5th Ward Weebie. It contains a sample from \"Ex-Factor\", written and performed by Lauryn Hill, which itself samples \"Can It Be All So Simple\", written and performed by Wu-Tang Clan. The latter song also samples \"The Way We Were\". Therefore, Hill, the eight members of Wu-Tang Clan, and Marvin Hamlisch, Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman are credited among the composers.\nIt debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, replacing Drake's own \"God's Plan\" and becoming his fifth US number one. It also topped the UK Singles Chart and ARIA Singles Chart, becoming his second number-one song of 2018 in the two countries after \"God's Plan\". Rolling Stone ranked it 54th on their list of the '100 Best  Songs of the 2010s'. In 2021, The Guardian ranked it number-one on their list of 'Drake's 30 Greatest songs'. The song was awarded two ASCAP Awards, including Top Rap Song, and was nominated for Best Rap Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\nOn March 14, 2018, Lauryn Hill's son Joshua Omaru Marley posted a snippet of the song on Snapchat. Drake later confirmed an upcoming Murda Beatz-produced single during an Instagram Live session. On April 5, Drake made a surprise appearance during a Majid Jordan concert in Toronto. \"The reason I'm here tonight is because I'm back in the city finishing my album,\" he told the audience. \"I've got a new single dropping tomorrow night, too, just in case you got some free time.\"\n\"Nice for What\" is an upbeat bounce song which contains elements of early 2000s R&B, with a length of three minutes thirty seconds. It samples Lauryn Hill's song \"Ex-Factor\" (1998), \"Drag Rap\" by the Showboys (1986), \"Get Your Roll On\" by Big Tymers (2000), and also features clips from performances by Big Freedia. Lyrically, the hook of Drake's song samples Lauryn Hill singing about \"cutting loose in the midst of a relationship\".\nDirected by Karena Evans, the accompanying music video shows women carrying out various activities, including swimming, dancing, modeling, playing with children, horse-riding, and holding a business meeting. It features guest appearances from, in order of appearance, Olivia Wilde, Misty Copeland, Issa Rae, Rashida Jones, Jourdan Dunn, Tracee Ellis Ross, Tiffany Haddish, Yara Shahidi, Zoe Saldana, Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhj\u00e4rta, Letitia Wright, Bria Vinaite, Emma Roberts, Syd, Michelle Rodriguez and Drake himself. Evans called it an honour to work on the video, writing on Instagram that it was \"a privilege and a blessing to have told this story with every single one of you revolutionary women, both in front and behind the camera\".\n\"Nice for What\" received positive reviews from music critics, with many praising its promotion of female empowerment. Hugh McIntyre of Forbes regarded the \"perfectly-pitched\" song as \"another perfect delivery from the biggest artist in hip-hop\", writing that the \"vocal sample helps the track stand out from much of the rest of his discography\". Kevin Lozano of Pitchfork awarded the song \"Best New Track\", praising Drake for \"smoothly handling the impeccable production from Murda Beatz\", and lauding the song as \"a fantastic piece of hip-hop machinery\" and \"one of Drake's most complete releases in some time\".\nChris DeVille of Stereogum deemed the song \"a big, brash, almost obnoxiously loud New Orleans bounce-inspired production\", describing it as \"extremely poppy and sounds like a bid for continued commercial dominance\".\nBillboard named \"Nice for What\" the fifth-best song of 2018. Rolling Stone also named \"Nice for What\" the fifth-best song of 2018, and ranked it 54th on their list of the '100 Best  Songs of the 2010s'.\nIn the United States, Drake became the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace his former number-one debut (\"God's Plan\") at the top of the Hot 100. It debuted with 88,000 downloads sold and 60.4 million streams. \"Nice for What\" became the 30th song in Billboard history"

The song contains a sample of Prince's \"Alphabet St.\" It peaked at number six in the United States and won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 1993.\nA 2007 poll of VH1 viewers placed the song at number 71 on the list of the \"Greatest Songs of the 90s\" and is listed as one of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It was ranked number 78 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. The song also served as the theme to the short-lived Malcolm-Jamal Warner sitcom Here and Now.\nSpeech was inspired to write the song after meeting up with his brother at his grandmother's funeral in Tennessee. Shortly afterward, his brother died suddenly from a bad asthma attack, and Speech wrote the song about the experience of losing two loved ones so close together.\n\"Tennessee\" uses a sample from Prince's \"Alphabet St.\" that was not cleared ahead of time. Prince's lawyers waited until after the song sold well and then charged the group $100,000 for the use of said sample. Speech later said he felt Prince gave him \"a break\" by demanding a single payment instead of co-writing credit on the song, which would have entitled Prince to a share of all royalties in the future.\nLarry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"Melodic, sing-song rap possesses a modern spiritual quality. Female vocalist Dionne adds heavy, soulful element to the proceedings. Socially relevant, thought-provoking lyrics lead listener into a hook-driven, memorable chorus. Track has a unique appeal and would add a new dimension to the average urban playlist.\" Randy Clark and Bryan DeVancy from Cashbox said that Arrested Development \"straight blew up on the scene\" with \"Tennessee\". They noted its \"rapping-while-singing approach\". James Bernard from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the lyrics of the song \"resonate like Speech\u2019s most private thoughts, betraying his desperate moments.\" Music writer James Masterton stated in his weekly UK chart commentary, \"The group who seemingly can do no wrong at present notch up their third hit.\" Andy Beevers from Music Week rated it five out of five, adding, \"arguably the best track on the LP\". James Hamilton from the magazine's RM Dance Update described it as a \"familiar jiggly roller\". A reviewer from People Magazine stated that \"the half-sung, half-rapped delivery of the band\u2019s leader, Speech (Todd Thomas), suggests a hayride with Sly Stone and Prince on the buckboard.\"\n\"Tennessee\" topped the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks for one week and peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100.\nIn the United Kingdom, the song spent a seven-week run on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number forty six, but after the top ten successes of both \"People Everyday\" and \"Mr. Wendal\" on the chart, it was re-released in 1993, charting for a further six weeks and peaking at number eighteen.\nThe music video for the song was directed by New York-based Macedonian film director, photographer and artist Milcho Manchevski. It was shot in Georgia, with friends of the group and people from the local area appearing in the clip. The video was published on YouTube in March 2009. It has amassed almost 9 million views as of September 2021.\nSlant Magazine listed \"Tennessee\" at number 98 in their ranking of \"The 100 Best Singles of the 1990s\" in 2011, writing, \"Perhaps no other track from the early \u201890s provided better (or catchier) proof that hip-hop was more versatile and capable than prevailing gangster-rap themes than Arrested Development\u2019s \"Tennessee\", its stuttering drumline ably providing a clean backdrop for expositions on civil rights, genealogical discovery, Southern culture, the devastating legacy of slavery, and the nature of God. A pained but uplifting narrative struggles at times to catch up with the song's driving gait, but \"Tennessee\" satisfies nonetheless, mixing raw, percussive power, quirky sampling, and inspirational imagery into one cerebral whole.\"\nBob Dylan played the song on the \"Tennessee\" episode of the first season of his Theme Time Radio Hour show in 2006, noting that Arrested Development had \"kind of updated the Sly and the Family Stone sound for the hip-hop generation\u201d.\nA 2007 poll of VH1 viewers placed it at number 71 on the \"Greatest Songs of the 90s\" list and was also ranked as one of the \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\" by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Written by Lamar, SZA, Sounwave, and Al Shux and produced by the latter two, the song was released on January 4, 2018, as the lead single to the soundtrack album of the film Black Panther. Its release coincided with Top Dawg Entertainment's announcement that its president, Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, and Lamar himself would be producing the Black Panther soundtrack album. Marvel Studios confirmed the news and revealed that Lamar was hand-picked by Black Panther's director, Ryan Coogler, to produce the soundtrack album. The song appeared in the movie during the end credits.\n\"All The Stars\" received numerous accolades and nominations including a nomination for Best Original Song at the 76th Golden Globe Awards and the 91st Academy Awards, as well as receiving four nominations at the 61st Grammy Awards including Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\"All The Stars\" won Best Song at the African-American Film Critics Association, while its video won Best Visual Effects at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.\nLamar first hinted at his involvement with the Black Panther soundtrack album in the music video for his song \"Love\", released on December 22, 2017. In the video, at about 1:54 into the song, a clapperboard is shown with the words \"B.Panther Soundtrack Coming Soon\". Lamar subsequently announced his involvement on January 4, 2018, along with the release of \"All The Stars\".\nUpon its release, Lamar announced his praise for Black Panther and its director, Ryan Coogler, writing \"the magnitude of [the] film showcases a great marriage of art and culture. I'm truly honored to contribute my knowledge of producing sound and writing music alongside Ryan and Marvel's vision.\"\n\"All The Stars\" received positive reviews from critics. Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone praised the song, calling Lamar's verse \"defiant\" and SZA's verse \"enthralling\" and \"filled with vocal turns\". However, Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork gave the song a negative review, calling it \"generic\" and \"pales in comparison to [Lamar and SZA's] recent works\". Pearce further wrote that the song is \"full of heavy-handed plotting and everyman cliches\" and is \"so nondescript that it reeks of compromise, devoid of personality or any true vision.\" Although Pearce complimented Lamar and SZA's performances and the \"slick production\", he ultimately wrote that \"'All the Stars' is uncharacteristically conservative for these two stars, all in service of a bigger picture.\"\nIn December 2018, Billboard ranked \"All The Stars\" as the 15th best song of the year.\nIn the week ending January 20, 2018, \"All The Stars\" debuted at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100. During its fifth week on the chart, it managed to rise to number 31 on the Hot 100, and in the week ending March 3, 2018, the single reached number seven on the Hot 100. It is Lamar's second top ten hit on the chart in 2018, following his collaboration with The Weeknd on \"Pray for Me\", which reached number seven in early February. It also became SZA's second top ten hit on the chart following her collaboration with Maroon 5 on the hit single \"What Lovers Do\". On the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, \"All The Stars\" debuted at number 19 and stayed in the top 20 for three weeks. In its fifth week, it rose to number five on the chart.\nWorldwide, the song peaked at number one in Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and Slovakia. The song reached the top ten in Australia, Canada, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\nThe music video for the song was filmed in January 2018 and released to Lamar's Vevo channel on YouTube on February 6, 2018. It was directed by Dave Meyers and the Little Homies. As of April 2021, the video has over 290 million views.\nThe video features themes and images of Afrocentrism and Afrofuturism, referencing the visual language of the film. The beginning of the video references to the Middle Passage, with appearances of Fulani hats, La Sape, Pantsula, Kufi caps, traditional African masks, and Kandake at the end. The video also features a sequence where Lamar walks alongside several panthers referencing the Black Panther soundtrack album.\nIn February 2018, British-Liberian artist Lina Iris Viktor claimed that images of her 24-karat gold patterned artwork were used in the music video without her permission.\n\nCredits adapted from"

It was released as the lead single on April 3, 2020, through Republic and OVO. The song is titled after social media influencer Toosie, who had previously helped the song go viral. A video was released alongside the song, showing Drake quarantined, due to the  COVID-19 pandemic. He also demonstrates the Toosie Slide dance in his Toronto mansion. The song debuted at number eighteen on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 before debuting at number one on the main Billboard Hot 100 chart the next week, making Drake the first male artist to accomplish three number-one debuts.\nOn March 29, 2020, social media influencer Toosie uploaded a clip showing him and his friends doing a dance challenge called the \"Toosie Slide\" while parts of the song are playing in the background. The dance was described as a \"modern day 'Cha Cha Slide' by DJ Casper\" and went viral after it was introduced to the app TikTok by Toosie, Hiii Key and Michigan duo Ayo & Teo. When it was subsequently shared on other social media pages, people considered possible involvement by Drake. He hinted at an impending release, saying \"I'mma drop soon since ya'll got it going insane\". Drake then took to his social media on March 31, 2020, to declare the song as his and revealed that it would be released the following Thursday at midnight, on Friday, April 3, 2020. American rapper Lil Baby revealed via Instagram that Drake wanted him on the song, calling himself a \"dumbass\" for not sending his verse back.\nThe song was produced by Turkish-Swiss producer Ozan Yildirim, professionally known as\u00a0OZ, who previously collaborated with Travis Scott on 2018's \"Sicko Mode\", featuring Drake. In 2019, he again worked with Drake on the songs \"Omert\u00e0\" and \"Gold Roses\", the latter being a Rick Ross single, featuring Drake. Just prior to \"Toosie Slide\", OZ produced another Drake-featured track, Future's \"Life Is Good\". As with most of his productions, OZ makes extensive use of hi-hats and a snare drum on \"Toosie Slide\". The song also contains bass drum kicks paired with Drake's \"melodic\" chorus.\nA trap song, \"Toosie Slide\" is a \"seductive confection engineered to cause an Internet stir\", containing \"stuttering cymbals, a couple bass drum kicks\" and \"elliptical set of beats\", leaving room for Drake's lyrics to take the spotlight, which he delivers with \"melodic bars\". Lyrically, Drake reflects on his \"inner pressure\", shouting out his friends, flirting with his many admirers and promising \"a hot summer of music\". He also gives dance directions for the song's titular dance, rapping \"It go right foot up, left foot slide/Left foot up, right foot slide/Basically I'm saying, either way we 'bout to slide, aye\". Drake makes numerous references to Michael Jackson throughout the song. \nDrake said, \"When I first made that song, I was only talking about the moonwalk. But Toosie made a dance to that shit, I didn't know it was gonna be a dance song like that\".\nThe song has been compared to \"Cupid Shuffle\" by Cupid, the Electric Slide dance by Richard L. \"Ric\" Silver, and \"Cha Cha Slide\" by DJ Casper, which has similar dance instructions. Billboard called it the \"'Cha Cha Slide' of the TikTok generation\".\n\"Toosie Slide\" generally polarized critics. Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork noted that despite Drake's ability of never needing \"to chase a hit\", for the first time it \"feels like he's a step behind\" and went on calling the track \"strictly a business decision\". Micah Peters of The Ringer was highly critical of the song as well as Drake's marketing ploys, comparing him to the DC Comics supervillain Darkseid. Peters further called producer OZ's production \"airy, barely there\", the hook \"awkward syllabic balance\" and said \"Toosie Slide\" feels marginal in the same way \"God's Plan\" did, \"and doubtlessly, it'll also walk to no. 1\". Ann Powers of NPR had a similar notion, labelling the song \"a bit of trivial fun that will probably become an inescapable hit on the strength of its marketing and its catchy chorus\". Conversely, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard named it among the most essential releases of the week, and said \"Drake is smart to launch a self-fashioned dance craze in this era, but 'Toosie Slide' also showcases his skill of conjuring hooks and catchphrases out of thin air, which helped make him who he is"

It was written by Drake with Boi-1da, and produced by the latter and Al Khaaliq (Nick Brongers). The orchestral samples were composed and arranged by Brongers. The single was released for digital download on March 8, 2010. The song is midtempo hip-hop with an orchestral backdrop, whose lyrics concern an introduction to fame.\nIt peaked in the top twenty of the United States and Canada, becoming Drake's fourth consecutive top twenty hit in the U.S. It also charted within the top five on the U.S. R&B and rap charts, his fourth consecutive top five on those charts. The song also charted in the United Kingdom and its R&B chart. The song's accompanying music video features Drake reflecting on an experience, and the struggle between his old life and the new. Several artists have made a freestyle over the track, including Eminem, Trey Songz, and Diggy Simmons, among others. Drake performed the song a number of times, including at the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards. The track received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. The song is also featured on the NBA 2K11 soundtrack.\n\"Shut It Down\" was originally planned to be released as the first single from Thank Me Later in late 2009, but Drake ultimately chose \"Over\", a song produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles \"Best I Ever Had\" and \"Forever\". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. Drake did a lot of work for the song and the album in Jamaica.\nThe song \"touches on Drake reaction to fame and stardom\"; Drake told MTV News that the song was \"definitely\" a choice of his for releasing as a single, and that it was a song he did for himself.  Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song \"a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness\". The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's \"Hip-Hop\", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his \"Thriller\" video, and commented, \"He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great\".\n\nThe video was shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, directed by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake on the video for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, \"The One\". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Mandler said he was a big Drake fan, and that Drake told him \"that nobody had really captured him\" on video\".\nBritish singer Rita Ora plays Drake's distant love interest in the video. It begins with Drake dressed sitting in a room on a bed, reflecting on his new life. Several images including explosions and cityscapes are shown on him and on the wall before the performance begins. Drake is later shown throughout the video in front of a gray backdrop, as he seems to be thinking about two women in his visions, Ora, who seems to portray the good girl, and another woman, who remained yet to be seen fully, portrayed as dangerous as she dances provocatively in the background. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the video \"artistically contradictory\". Scenes of Drake sitting \"alone in his bedroom\" are pensive and rebellious\", and called them \"controlled chaos\", but said that it worked in the video. Wete also pointed out that \"He chose not to go the cliche rap-video route and fill his four-minute flick with nearly naked women, Ciroc bottles, and Beamers\", and that he stuck with \"one leading lady\".\nSeveral artists have remixed or made a freestyle over the beat, including Eminem, B.o.B, Sean Kingston, Royce da 5'9\", Trey Songz, Fat Joe, Teairra Mar\u00ed, and Diggy Simmons. Simmons, the first to release a freestyle over the track, told Vibe, \"With that freestyle, I heard the track, loved"

It was released by Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records as the second single from the album on April 6, 2018, along with its music video. The song was produced by Murda Beatz, Noah \"40\" Shebib and Corey Litwin with co-production handled by Blaqnmild. It features additional vocals by Big Freedia and 5th Ward Weebie. It contains a sample from \"Ex-Factor\", written and performed by Lauryn Hill, which itself samples \"Can It Be All So Simple\", written and performed by Wu-Tang Clan. The latter song also samples \"The Way We Were\". Therefore, Hill, the eight members of Wu-Tang Clan, and Marvin Hamlisch, Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman are credited among the composers.\nIt debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, replacing Drake's own \"God's Plan\" and becoming his fifth US number one. It also topped the UK Singles Chart and ARIA Singles Chart, becoming his second number-one song of 2018 in the two countries after \"God's Plan\". Rolling Stone ranked it 54th on their list of the '100 Best  Songs of the 2010s'. In 2021, The Guardian ranked it number-one on their list of 'Drake's 30 Greatest songs'. The song was awarded two ASCAP Awards, including Top Rap Song, and was nominated for Best Rap Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\nOn March 14, 2018, Lauryn Hill's son Joshua Omaru Marley posted a snippet of the song on Snapchat. Drake later confirmed an upcoming Murda Beatz-produced single during an Instagram Live session. On April 5, Drake made a surprise appearance during a Majid Jordan concert in Toronto. \"The reason I'm here tonight is because I'm back in the city finishing my album,\" he told the audience. \"I've got a new single dropping tomorrow night, too, just in case you got some free time.\"\n\"Nice for What\" is an upbeat bounce song which contains elements of early 2000s R&B, with a length of three minutes thirty seconds. It samples Lauryn Hill's song \"Ex-Factor\" (1998), \"Drag Rap\" by the Showboys (1986), \"Get Your Roll On\" by Big Tymers (2000), and also features clips from performances by Big Freedia. Lyrically, the hook of Drake's song samples Lauryn Hill singing about \"cutting loose in the midst of a relationship\".\nDirected by Karena Evans, the accompanying music video shows women carrying out various activities, including swimming, dancing, modeling, playing with children, horse-riding, and holding a business meeting.

Hugh McIntyre of Forbes regarded the \"perfectly-pitched\" song as \"another perfect delivery from the biggest artist in hip-hop\", writing that the \"vocal sample helps the track stand out from much of the rest of his discography\". Kevin Lozano of Pitchfork awarded the song \"Best New Track\", praising Drake for \"smoothly handling the impeccable production from Murda Beatz\", and lauding the song as \"a fantastic piece of hip-hop machinery\" and \"one of Drake's most complete releases in some time\".\nChris DeVille of Stereogum deemed the song \"a big, brash, almost obnoxiously loud New Orleans bounce-inspired production\", describing it as \"extremely poppy and sounds like a bid for continued commercial dominance\".\nBillboard named \"Nice for What\" the fifth-best song of 2018. Rolling Stone also named \"Nice for What\" the fifth-best song of 2018, and ranked it 54th on their list of the '100 Best  Songs of the 2010s'.\nIn the United States, Drake became the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace his former number-one debut (\"God's Plan\") at the top of the Hot 100. It debuted with 88,000 downloads sold and 60.4 million streams. \"Nice for What\" became the 30th song in Billboard history"

Written and produced by Elly Jackson and Ben Langmaid, the song was released as the album's lead single on 15 December 2008 by Kitsun\u00e9. It peaked at number 153 on the UK Singles Chart upon limited release. When re-released on 23 November 2009, the single re-entered the chart at number 129.\nJackson told The London Paper that the song is about \"having an intense moment with someone, when maybe you're watching a film or listening to music, and both of you are yearning for the other one, and it's almost painful to sit next to them.\"\n\"Quicksand\" was met with critical acclaim. Digital Spy music editor Nick Levine wrote that \"[l]ike most of the songs on their debut album, it's a winning combination of pop smarts, stifling romantic obsession and production that mixes the sounds of '82 with the sonic punch of '09.\" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian commented that \"the sparse dynamics and stabbing synthesisers of 'Quicksand' offer a reminder that not every aspect of the 80s has been mined to exhaustion in recent years.\" Peter Paphides of The Times called the song \"superb\" and added, \"Propelled along by a melody that shares some of its DNA with Prince's 'When Doves Cry', Jackson casts herself as the recipient of an overture from someone already in a relationship.\"\nJohn Murphy, writing for musicOMH, described the song as \"instantly addictive and catchy\", while stating that \"unlike a lot of electro acts out there, 'Quicksand' has real heart and emotion to it as well\u2014certainly not a case of style over substance.\" AllMusic's Heather Phares noted that the track \"uses a relentlessly tight arrangement and Jackson's frosty soulfulness to give the song's obsession a shot of excitement.\" Luke Turner of NME referred to \"Quicksand\" as \"liquid-mercury-smooth but pierced by sharp vocals.\"\nThe music video of \"Quicksand\" was directed by Kinga Burza. It was released on YouTube on 13 January 2009. The video shows Jackson on a tropical island with pineapples and the sun setting. Girls are dancing. Jackson is seen with a parrot on her shoulder, singing. It mostly features Jackson singing with the sun setting behind her.\n\nFrench 12-inch single\nA1. \"Quicksand\" (Original) \u2013 3:07\nA2. \"Quicksand\" (autoKratz Drags to Riches Mix) \u2013 4:44\nB1. \"Quicksand\" (Beni's Sinking at 1.56 Mix) \u2013 4:20\nB2. \"Quicksand\" (Chateau Marmont Remix) \u2013 3:34\nFrench digital EP\n\"Quicksand\" \u2013 3:07\n\"Quicksand\" (AutoKratz Drags to Riches Mix) \u2013 4:42\n\"Quicksand\" (Beni's Sinking at 1.56 Mix) \u2013 4:18\n\"Quicksand\" (Chateau Marmont Remix) \u2013 3:32\n\"Quicksand\" (Joe and Will Ask?

The song was written by RedOne, Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, Bilal Hajji, and Achraf Jannusi, with co-writing credits from Minaj, and production was handled by RedOne, Falk and Yacoub. Despite the song not winning the poll where Minaj asked fans to pick the next single from her album, Minaj went ahead and released \"Pound the Alarm\" due to a large number of airplay requests for the song.\nMusically, \"Pound the Alarm\" is a Eurodance song that talks about having a good time and partying all night, as well as going to festivals/carnivals as the music video portrays. The song reached the top ten in Australia, Canada, Finland, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\nThe accompanying music video was shot in her native birth country, Trinidad and Tobago, and features Minaj performing at a national Trinidad and Tobago Carnival as well as dancing from locals of the country. The music video received positive reviews, many enjoying the fun atmosphere. The song was featured on Minaj's Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour. The song is included in the game Just Dance 2014. It is also one of the select songs available on the demo version.\nOn May 24, 2012, a poll was posted on Minaj's official website asking the fans to choose the next single(s). The poll is divided into three categories. The third and final category asks to choose between \"Pound the Alarm\", \"Whip It\", and \"Va Va Voom\". \"Va Va Voom\" had the most votes and won the poll. \"Whip It\" came in second and \"Pound the Alarm\" came in third. After the poll results were finalized, a fan then told Minaj; \"\u039d\u039f\u039f\u039f!! Pound The Alarm is way more energetic!!!\", where Minaj replied: \"I agree!!!! Fun2perform.

It officially impacted Australian radio on June 12, 2012, where it was the most added track of the week. It also impacted UK radio on June 15, 2012. In the United States, the song was released as the second mainstream single and fourth single overall from the album on July 17, 2012.\n\"Pound the Alarm\" is a Eurodance song produced by RedOne, Falk, and Rami. It is composed in common time in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 125 beats per minute. It moves in common time and follows a chord progression of C\u266fm\u2013G\u266fm\u2013A\u2013B, and Nicki's vocals span from B\u2083 to A\u2084. The song makes use of EDM, techno and house in its composition, while also being influenced by rave. After each chorus there is a \"frantic\" Eurodance and dubstep breakdown, and also features the sounds of alarms, which were sampled from American artist Britney Spears from her 2000 single Stronger, weaving beats, and \"seize-the-night\" lyrics.\nLyrically, it talks about having a good time and partying. However, in one of the verses, she warns her lover by saying, \"I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle\", meaning that whilst muzzles prevent dogs from barking, nobody can stop her from saying what she wants to say, as she is a 'bad bitch'.

It was released as the first single from her debut solo album, Deadline for My Memories. Written by Martin and David Harrow, it is known to be one of her most notable singles. It was produced by English electronic dance group the Grid and was originally released on 31 October 1994. The track found greater chart success in 1995, when it peaked at number one in Italy and on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs and number 6 on the UK Singles Chart. On the Eurochart Hot 100, \"Your Loving Arms\" reached number 21. There were made two different music videos for the song. In 1996, Mixmag ranked it at number 47 in its 100 Greatest Dance Singles Of All Time list.\n\"Your Loving Arms\" received favorable reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor John Bush described it as a \"magical\" electro-pop track. On the 1994 release, Larry Flick from Billboard called it \"a spirited foray into trancecarpeted hi-NRG territory. Her distinctively creamy voice has seldom sounded so strong and worldly, giving the song's romantic prose a decidedly dark and anxious edge.\" In 1995, he added it as \"an NRGetic dance number that makes excellent use of her milky soprano range. Her torchy style makes an intriguing contrast with the Grid's cool and rigid groove production.\" He also called it \"deliciously dramatic\". Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report said that \"there's something in Billie Ray's voice that is simply magnetic. This one-time member of London's Electribe 101 releases a lot of electricity on her own as proven by one super hot dance track.\" Ross Jones from The Guardian complimented the singer as the \"owner of this era's most haunting voice\". He wrote, \"At first, this high-octane disco spinner doesn't seem like the best place for her Marlene-meets-Aretha tones, but listen closely and try imagining anyone else caressing it so lovingly, with such unassailable cool.\" On the re-release, he called it a \"glowing piece of dancefloor TNT\". \nJohn Hamilton from Idolator described it as \"fiery\" and \"a predestined club classic, a pulsating techno torch song in which Martin sasses, vamps, and pleads over ominous rising chords and a frantic tambourine-inflected beat.\" Howard Cohen from Knight Ridder said that \"an instantly memorable hook, retro-disco beat and warm, inviting vocals make this the most musical dance offering 1995 has offered so far.\" Music writer James Masterton commented, \"Her first solo hit is more of what she has become known for, a haunting, slinky piece of dance music that is so good as to be utterly uncommercial.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote, \"Is there such a thing as adult-orientated pop dance? If there isn't yet, then it is debuting right here thanks to a lady who looks like Marianne Faithfull's twin sister with the voice of Carly Simon.\" James Hamilton from Music Week's RM Dance Update deemed it \"mournful\" and \"husky\". Barry Walters from Spin stated that it \"was the pop song with underground credibility, one that everyone could agree had something special. Martin's lyrics speak of profound joy and pain, the melody soars through consciousness like a caress, and the vocal sets itself apart from the wailing of generic gut-busting divas.\"\n\"Your Loving Arms\" was a major hit in Europe and remains Ray Martin's most successful song to date. It went to number-one in Italy and was a Top 10 hit in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 6 in its second week on the UK Singles Chart, on May 21, 1995. But on the UK Dance Chart, the single reached number 2. On the Eurochart Hot 100, \"Your Loving Arms\" peaked at number 21 on June 3, 1995. Outside Europe, it hit number-one on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs, number 5 in Israel and number 85 in Australia in November 1995. Additionally, the single also went to number 46 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 30 on the US Cash Box singles chart in 1996. It received a silver record in the United Kingdom with a sale of 200,000 singles.\nThere were made two different music videos for the song. The UK version is in black-and-white and features Ray Martin performing the song in a bedroom, sometimes lying on the bed or sitting in a chair. Other scenes features the singer walking in a garden or dancing with a man in a hallway. The second version is in colours. The UK version was uploaded to YouTube in 2014.\nBritish electronic and clubbing magazine Mixmag listed the song at number 47 in its"

Released on August 4, 2014 by Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records, and Republic Records as the second single from the album, the song was produced by Polow da Don, DJ Spydr, and Da Internz, and prominently samples \"Baby Got Back\" (1992) by Sir Mix-a-Lot. The song peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Minaj's highest charting song on the Hot 100 at the time. The song also peaked within the top ten in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, top forty in Austria, France and Portugal and top fifty in Czech Republic. \nColin Tilley directed an accompanying video for the song, which was released on August 19, 2014. Following the video's release, it broke the 24-hour streaming record on Vevo by accumulating 19.6 million views in its first day of release, which Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" later surpassed in 2015. In 2021, Anaconda became first music video for a solo female rap song to hit 1 billion views.  To further promote the song, Minaj performed it live at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and also performed it at Fashion Rocks and the iHeartRadio Music Festival. \"Anaconda\" was nominated for Best Rap Song at the 2015 Grammy Awards. The song was also nominated for two categories at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, Best Female Video and Best Hip-Hop Video, winning the latter.\nOn August 5, 2014, producer Polow da Don claimed the \"Anaconda\" instrumental was originally intended for rapper and musician Missy Elliott, but was scrapped and then re-recorded by Minaj. However, on August 24, 2014, Elliott revealed to fans and followers via her Twitter account that Polow's recollections were untrue and additionally confirmed that she never received the alleged instrumental. The cover art for the single went viral on the web after being revealed. On various digital music stores, the cover art is censored with the Parental Advisory label over Minaj's buttocks. The song heavily samples \"Baby Got Back\" by Sir Mix-a-Lot, who also has vocals in the chorus of the song.\nThe song has been viewed by some as a diss track, in answer to \"Baby Got Back\". Whereas Sir Mix-a-Lot focuses on a woman's body and the pleasure it gives him, Minaj raps from the perspective of the unnamed woman, and shows how she uses her body to profit and empower herself.\nAccording to Minaj's sound engineer Aubry \"Big Juice\" Delaine, \"Anaconda\" had 27 different versions at first. Production team Da Internz were then brought in to add drums to the song, whereafter it was sent for mixing and mastering, which made it \"perfect\".\nMusically, the song is a hip hop and pop-rap song. The song is written in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 130 beats per minute.\nCarolyn Menyes from Music Times said it is a bit \"raunchy\" though this was \"expected\" and saying \"Anaconda\" continues Minaj's promise to move away from her poppier singles such as \"Super Bass\" and \"Starships\", and go back to her hardcore rap roots. Kory Grow from Rolling Stone praised the use of the \"Baby Got Back\" sample and said the song stayed true to the theme of the original. Kevin Goddard from HotNewHipHop said \"Nicki's raunchy new version may be the next big thing to hit the industry.\" Dan Reilly from Spin said \"Minaj takes the good Sir's '92 ode to protruding posteriors and adds a heavy dose of 2014 sex lingo.\" Amy Davidson from Digital Spy gave the song three stars out of five and said that \"Nicki's breaking down barriers.\"\nSir Mix-a-Lot said he had, \"a whole new level of respect for Minaj\" after hearing the record and that he became a \"fan for life\" of Minaj.\nThe song made Spin's end of year 'The 101 Best Songs of 2014' list. It ranked #3 on the list of 101 entries and Spin herald it \"much more than just a song\" but a \"cultural movement.\" She was the only rapper to make the top ten of the list as a lead artist. \"Anaconda\" was also placed at number two on MTV's Best Songs of 2014.\nHowever, despite the positive reviews the song received negative reactions. The London Economic called it \"one of the worst songs ever.\" Critics from National Review referred to the song as \"degrading,\" adding that it promoted prostitution, drug abuse and immorality to young girls. A city in Israel banned the song and prohibited"

The song was written by RedOne, Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, Bilal Hajji, and Achraf Jannusi, with co-writing credits from Minaj, and production was handled by RedOne, Falk and Yacoub. Despite the song not winning the poll where Minaj asked fans to pick the next single from her album, Minaj went ahead and released \"Pound the Alarm\" due to a large number of airplay requests for the song.\nMusically, \"Pound the Alarm\" is a Eurodance song that talks about having a good time and partying all night, as well as going to festivals/carnivals as the music video portrays. The song reached the top ten in Australia, Canada, Finland, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\nThe accompanying music video was shot in her native birth country, Trinidad and Tobago, and features Minaj performing at a national Trinidad and Tobago Carnival as well as dancing from locals of the country. The music video received positive reviews, many enjoying the fun atmosphere. The song was featured on Minaj's Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour. The song is included in the game Just Dance 2014. It is also one of the select songs available on the demo version.\nOn May 24, 2012, a poll was posted on Minaj's official website asking the fans to choose the next single(s). The poll is divided into three categories. The third and final category asks to choose between \"Pound the Alarm\", \"Whip It\", and \"Va Va Voom\". \"Va Va Voom\" had the most votes and won the poll. \"Whip It\" came in second and \"Pound the Alarm\" came in third. After the poll results were finalized, a fan then told Minaj; \"\u039d\u039f\u039f\u039f!! Pound The Alarm is way more energetic!!!\", where Minaj replied: \"I agree!!!! Fun2perform. But the polls don't lie do they?\".\" The song was eventually trending on Twitter for the choice of the songs. Moments later she tweeted: \"Oop. Just got word that radio 1 in the uk and nova & 2day fm in australia are runnin w/ #poundthealarm due to the amount of requests\" and later added after \"Sorry va va voomers...Looks like France has chosen #poundthealarm for the win as well barbz.\"\nMinaj confirmed on Twitter on June 6, 2012, that she chose \"Pound the Alarm\" as the next single instead of \"Va Va Voom\" owing to the number of radio requests \"Pound the Alarm\" was getting in the UK, Australia, and France. It officially impacted Australian radio on June 12, 2012, where it was the most added track of the week. It also impacted UK radio on June 15, 2012. In the United States, the song was released as the second mainstream single and fourth single overall from the album on July 17, 2012.\n\"Pound the Alarm\" is a Eurodance song produced by RedOne, Falk, and Rami. It is composed in common time in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 125 beats per minute. It moves in common time and follows a chord progression of C\u266fm\u2013G\u266fm\u2013A\u2013B, and Nicki's vocals span from B\u2083 to A\u2084. The song makes use of EDM, techno and house in its composition, while also being influenced by rave. After each chorus there is a \"frantic\" Eurodance and dubstep breakdown, and also features the sounds of alarms, which were sampled from American artist Britney Spears from her 2000 single Stronger, weaving beats, and \"seize-the-night\" lyrics.\nLyrically, it talks about having a good time and partying. However, in one of the verses, she warns her lover by saying, \"I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle\", meaning that whilst muzzles prevent dogs from barking, nobody can stop her from saying what she wants to say, as she is a 'bad bitch'. When the song received mixed reception from critics with it being too similar, RedOne, who produced both the song and \"Starships\" told MTV News that \"Pound the Alarm\" is sonically edgier. \"It's got the pop element, but it's got some hard-core elements, some dance underground elements.\" Laurence Green from MusicOMH compared the song to 2 Unlimited by saying \"The techno push of 'Pound the Alarm' comes on like [2 Unlimited] set loose in the studio [...]\".

It was first released on 7 October 1998 in Italy by Bliss Corporation and became internationally successful the following year. It is the lead single of their debut album Europop. The song is the group's most popular single, reaching number one in many countries' music charts, such as Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, New Zealand, Israel, Lebanon, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Australia, Austria, Greece, Germany, and Hungary, as well as reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in January 2000.\nIn the United Kingdom, the song initially entered the top 40 purely on import sales; it was only the third single to do this. The song also received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 2001 Grammy Awards, two years after it was released.\nWritten by Eiffel 65 lead singer Jeffrey Jey, keyboardist Maurizio Lobina, and producer Massimo Gabutti, \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" was inspired by Lobina's composed opening piano hook. The producers of the song then came up with the idea for a dance song. Jey explained that his inspiration for the lyrics was how a person chooses their lifestyle. The colour blue as the main theme of the song was picked at random, with Lobina telling him to write nonsensical lyrics. Gabutti came up with the \"da ba dee\" hook. The pitch-shifted vocal effect used in the song was created with a harmonizer.\n\"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" is written in the key of G minor, with the vocal range spanning from C\u2083 to E\u266d\u2084, and is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 128 beats per minute.\nThe song's lyrics tell a story about a man who lives in a \"blue world.\" It also explains that he is \"blue inside and outside,\" which, alongside the lyric \"himself and everybody around 'cause he ain't got nobody to listen,\" and \"blue are the feelings that live inside me\" may indicate that the term blue represents his emotional state; however, the song also explains that a vast variety of what he owns is also blue, including his house and his car (\"a blue Corvette\"): different blue-coloured objects are also depicted on the single's cover. The song's hook is the sentence \"I'm blue,\" followed by a repetition of the sounds \"da ba dee da ba die\", which the hook is based around.\nThe song received mixed reviews from critics. Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that \"the hook here, with its dancy but curiously compelling singsongy rhythm and lyric, is destined to react instantly with listeners far and wide.\" He also noted that it has a \"euro sound\", and \"it's creative, it will affect listeners on both ends of the demographic spectrum, and it's anthemic.\" Entertainment Weekly positively reviewed the song, calling the song \"a fleeting, feel-good foot-tapper\" and gave the song a rating of B-. Daily Record said it is the \"strangest-sounding Euro-club hit of the summer\". The Daily Vault's Christopher Thelen described it as a \"quirky little hit\" with a \"bouncy chorus\". He also noted that \"the key is the use of the voice synthesizer\". PopMatters reviewer Chris Massey, in his review of Europop, described his initial reaction to the song as being \"really, really bad.\" However, he later stated in the review that after many repeated listenings of the song he \"loved it.\" AllMusic editor Jose F. Promis described the song as a \"hypnotic smash\" in his review of Europop.\nRolling Stone, however, in their review of Europop, gave the song a negative review, commenting that the song \"blends Cher-esque vocoder vocals, trance-like synth riffs, unabashed Eurodisco beats and a baby-babble chorus so infantile it makes the Teletubbies sound like Shakespeare.\" The magazine also placed the song on their list of the \"20 Most Annoying Songs,\" at No. 14.\nThe single, released in October 1998, was a chart-topper in many European countries. The song initially found success in France, where it debuted in August 1999 and reached number one for three weeks. It then found success in other European countries, reaching the top spot on many charts in September the same year, including Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and many other countries. It replaced \"Mambo No. 5\" by Lou Bega on many of these charts at the top spot. In the United Kingdom, the song spent three weeks at the top of the singles chart in September and"

It was released on June 1, 2010 by Young Money, Cash Money, and Universal Motown as the lead single of the album. The song was written by Minaj, Joseph Hughes, David Freeman, and Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel, and was produced by the latter. Minaj originally intended to release \"Massive Attack\" as the lead single from Pink Friday, though its release was scrapped after an underwhelming commercial performance.\nDescribed as a \"rap ballad\", the song is a change of tempo compared to Minaj's previous work, and according to Mariel Concepcion of Billboard, the song contains a \"new brand of hood majesty.\" The song samples Annie Lennox's 1995 cover version of the song \"No More I Love You's\" (1986) by The Lover Speaks, using its background vocals with additional bass, hip-hop backbeats and drum loops added. The song peaked at numbers 14 and four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts, respectively. As of June 2016 the song has sold 1.5 million digital downloads.\nThe first version of \"Your Love\" appeared on Nicki Minaj's unofficial mixtape Barbie World (2010), with different lyrics included in the pre-chorus along with a faster pace. Another version was later stolen and leaked online. The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying \"That was a leak and I was so upset they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago. Next thing you know, people started falling in love with it.\" Whilst on set on the music video for \"Your Love\", Minaj further explain about the song's theft and leak, saying, \n\"I was not planning on putting the song out at all. But then I heard it one day, somebody told me it was online. And I was like, 'No way, no way in the world that song is out.' I went and listened to it and was really upset. It wasn't mixed, it wasn't finished, it wasn't anything \u2014 I wasn't gonna use it at all. But then radio started playing it.\"\nRap-Up posted cover art featuring a close up of Minaj smirking to her right, however for unknown reasons the art work was changed. The new cover features a cartoon version of Minaj, made by illustrator Asia Kendrick-Horton who posted it for Minaj on Twitter.\n\"Your Love\" is a mid-tempo song with the heavy use of Auto-Tune in the chorus. It samples the instrumentals and background vocals of Annie Lennox's cover version of \"No More I Love You's\" by the Lover Speaks, with the addition of additional bass, drum-loops and hip-hop backbeats. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, \"Your Love\" is set in common time with a metronome of 94 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Minaj's vocal range spanning from the low-note of B\u2083 to the high-note of C\u266f\u2085.\nSara D. Anderson of AOL Radio Blog described the song as a \"rap/singing mash-up.\" Coined as a \"new brand of hood majesty,\" the song is accompanied by a simple beat, which includes finger snaps and \"xylophone clings.\" Lean Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented: \"Rap's spitfire explores her softer side, sampling Annie Lennox on her honey-tongued ode to a good man.\" Greenblatt went on to compare the song to Jay-Z's \"kindred\" \"Young Forever.\" Minaj makes several references in her lines to well known people, which includes Bruce Willis in Die Hard, as well as Adam and Eve. Minaj makes several connections to Superman including in the pre-chorus, \"'S' on my chest, let me get my cape on.\" The official remix featuring Cash Money labelmate Jay Sean was leaked via-internet on August 2, 2010, and later made available for purchase in Australia via iTunes. American rapper Flo Rida released an unofficial remix to the song, in which he adds a verse. Reggae recording artist Sean Paul also did a remix to the song where he ad-libs his verse throughout the original and later adds his own verse. Other remixes to the song include those done by American rapper Rick Ross and American R&B singer Chris Brown.\nRap-Up stated that Minaj \"slows down her rapid-fire verses on the sticky and sweet \"Your Love\" ... with a sprinkling of Auto-Tune to top it off. Young Money's First Lady even exercises her vocal chops. We demand another helping.\""

The song was written by RedOne, Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, Bilal Hajji, and Achraf Jannusi, with co-writing credits from Minaj, and production was handled by RedOne, Falk and Yacoub. Despite the song not winning the poll where Minaj asked fans to pick the next single from her album, Minaj went ahead and released \"Pound the Alarm\" due to a large number of airplay requests for the song.\nMusically, \"Pound the Alarm\" is a Eurodance song that talks about having a good time and partying all night, as well as going to festivals/carnivals as the music video portrays. The song reached the top ten in Australia, Canada, Finland, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\nThe accompanying music video was shot in her native birth country, Trinidad and Tobago, and features Minaj performing at a national Trinidad and Tobago Carnival as well as dancing from locals of the country. The music video received positive reviews, many enjoying the fun atmosphere. The song was featured on Minaj's Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour. The song is included in the game Just Dance 2014. It is also one of the select songs available on the demo version.\nOn May 24, 2012, a poll was posted on Minaj's official website asking the fans to choose the next single(s). The poll is divided into three categories. The third and final category asks to choose between \"Pound the Alarm\", \"Whip It\", and \"Va Va Voom\". \"Va Va Voom\" had the most votes and won the poll. \"Whip It\" came in second and \"Pound the Alarm\" came in third. After the poll results were finalized, a fan then told Minaj; \"\u039d\u039f\u039f\u039f!! Pound The Alarm is way more energetic!!!\", where Minaj replied: \"I agree!!!! Fun2perform. But the polls don't lie do they?\".\" The song was eventually trending on Twitter for the choice of the songs. Moments later she tweeted: \"Oop. Just got word that radio 1 in the uk and nova & 2day fm in australia are runnin w/ #poundthealarm due to the amount of requests\" and later added after \"Sorry va va voomers...Looks like France has chosen #poundthealarm for the win as well barbz.\"\nMinaj confirmed on Twitter on June 6, 2012, that she chose \"Pound the Alarm\" as the next single instead of \"Va Va Voom\" owing to the number of radio requests \"Pound the Alarm\" was getting in the UK, Australia, and France. It officially impacted Australian radio on June 12, 2012, where it was the most added track of the week. It also impacted UK radio on June 15, 2012. In the United States, the song was released as the second mainstream single and fourth single overall from the album on July 17, 2012.\n\"Pound the Alarm\" is a Eurodance song produced by RedOne, Falk, and Rami. It is composed in common time in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 125 beats per minute. It moves in common time and follows a chord progression of C\u266fm\u2013G\u266fm\u2013A\u2013B, and Nicki's vocals span from B\u2083 to A\u2084.

The song was released on May 21, 2009, and debuted at number two on the Canadian and Billboard Hot 100, behind the group's previous single \"Boom Boom Pow\", making the group one of 11 artists who have occupied the top two positions of the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. It reached number one on the US charts and 20 charts worldwide.\nThe song was nominated for Record of the Year at the 52nd Grammy Awards and won the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. \"I Gotta Feeling\" ranked fifth on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. The song was also nominated as Song of the Year at the 2009 World Music Awards. In March 2011, it became the first song in digital history to sell over 7 million digital copies in the United States. As of June 2019, \"I Gotta Feeling\" had over 9 million downloads in the country, and held the record as the most downloaded song on iTunes of all time. This also makes it the highest selling digital as well as non-charity single in the US ever.\n\"I Gotta Feeling\" spent 14 consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, making it the longest-running number-one single of 2009. The song was the third most successful song of the decade in Australia, as announced on January 7, 2010.\n\"I Gotta Feeling\" was written and composed by all the members of The Black Eyed Peas (credited as William Adams, Allan Pineda, Jaime Gomez, and Stacy Ferguson) together with French producers David Guetta, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer (a.k.a. Fred Rister ), both of whom produced the song. Adams provided additional synthesizer work to the song. The song was recorded at Square Prod in Paris, France and Metropolis Studios in London, England, United Kingdom. \"I Gotta Feeling\" is the second single released from The E.N.D (2009). Interscope Records serviced the song to contemporary hit and rhythmic crossover radios on June 23, 2009, in the United States. In an interview with Annie Reuter of Marie Claire, will.i.am stated that \"It's dedicated to all the party people out there in the world that want to go out and party. Mostly every song on the Black Eyed Peas record is painting a picture of our party life. It was a conscious decision to make this type of record. Times are really hard for a lot of people and you want to give them escape and you want to make them feel good about life, especially at these low points.\"\nThe song is an uptempo dance-pop song that runs a length of four minutes and 49 seconds. It follows in the inspirational dance-pop theme of The E.N.D, being built upon the heavy use of Auto-Tune and futuristic synthesizers while running through a tick-tock rhythm. It is composed in the key of G major. The song begins in a restrained fashion then moves into a throbbing dance beat that changes patterns so that at least one reviewer thought it shifted tempos, although in fact the tempo does not change at all, suggesting the use of a click track in recording. It contains electronic influences. The song samples a beat from the song \"Take a Dive\" by Bryan Pringle. The \"woo-hoo\" line is sampled from The Police's song \"Every Breath You Take\". Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times noted the song's similarities to Five Stairsteps' song \"Ooh Child\", writing that it emulates the song's \"use of a repetitive, warm vocal line to signify a good mood coming on.\" According to Jimmy Iovine of the Interscope Geffen A&M label group, the melody was inspired by the U2 song \"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\": \"I sent will.i.am over to the studio to do some remixes on I'll Go Crazy. He works on them for two weeks, comes back and writes I Gotta Feeling. The chords are U2 chords, 100 per cent. Will even told them.\"\n\"I Gotta Feeling\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. David Balls, a writer for Digital Spy, gave the song a four-star rating, writing that the song is \"every bit as quirky as its predecessor (\"Boom Boom Pow\")\". However, he compared it to Girls Aloud's \"Biology\", writing that they sound like a collection of musical ideas \"that only makes sense after a few listens.\" Another writer for Digital Spy, Nick Levine, praised \"I Gotta Feeling\" and \"Rock That Body\" as ace collaborations with French disc jockey David Guetta. Music critics like John Bush of All Music Guide and Andy Gill"

The song serves as the fifth international single from the album, and was released in Australia on January 29, 2010, in the United Kingdom on March 15 and in the United States on May 11. The song peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming the fifth top ten hit from the album.\nCo-produced by French DJ/producer David Guetta, the song heavily samples from Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's \"It Takes Two\", making use of the line \"I wanna rock right now\" multiple times, as well as the drum break, and part of the \"Yeah! Woo!\" line. The Black Eyed Peas use Auto-Tune throughout the song, and Fergie's voice has been notably high-pitched. Spin described \"Rock That Body\" as \"trance-y\". The song is most known to critics as a robotic party track on the album. The song has been compared to be stylistically similar to Flo Rida, whose song \"Club Can't Handle Me\" (from the motion picture Step Up 3D) Guetta would later go on to produce.\nFraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog gave \"Rock That Body\" three out of five stars and called it \"a party banger\". \"Rock That Body\" was well-reviewed by Mike Schiller of PopMatters. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating: \"It's got plenty of pounding beats, synths that sound like they've been filled with Red Bull and more twisted vocal effects than an mp3 of Akon cutting loose in a vocoder factory. It's pretty simple stuff and it will no doubt grate something rotten on the 36th listen...\"\nThe song was a success, reaching the top ten in many countries and top twenty in a number of others, too. \nOn the US Billboard Hot 100, the song peaked at number nine, making it their fifth consecutive top ten hit. For airplay, it proved to be their lowest-charting song since non-single \"Gone Going\" from their fourth studio album Monkey Business (2005), released to radio stations in early 2006.\nThe video was filmed on January 13, 2010, at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California. Directed by Rich Lee, it was shot back to back with the video for \"Imma Be\", the fourth song on The E.N.D. The two songs were mashed up into a medley, which is titled \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\". The medley length is 8:15 and the music video in total is 10:21. It premiered on Vevo and Dipdive on Tuesday, February 16, 2010. The videos were separated for music channels with the introduction and conclusion removed. The video is described as a futuristic Wizard of Oz. It is the sequel for the \"Imma Be\" video and the second half of the \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\" video. It begins with the Black Eyed Peas and their good robot arriving at a city, the people in the city are stuck in a glitch. The 4 members of the group shoot them with their stereo-guns to end their loop so they could continue dancing. As things are going well, the bad robot appears and kidnaps Fergie, will.i.am chases after it with his own robot while Fergie fights the bad robot and the other two members free the remaining people. After many failed attempts, will.i.am manages to shoot the bad robot, which starts dancing with the good robot. The video ends as the bad robot runs out of energy and faints. The \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\" video closes with a scene which reveals the entire story to be Fergie's dream as the other members find her barely conscious following her motorcycle accident in the introduction. As they check to see if she is okay, Fergie excitedly begins to tell them of her idea for their next music video.\nUK CD Single\nDigital Download E.P.\nSongwriting - will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, Fergie, David Guetta, Mark Knight, Adam Walder, Jean Baptiste, Jamie Munson, Robert Ginyard\nVocals - will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, Fergie\nProduction - David Guetta, will.i.am, Mark Knight, Funkagenda\nKeyboards - Mark Night, Adam Walder, will.i.am\nGuitar, additional keyboards, additional vocals - Hal Ritson\nArrangement - will.i.am\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n\nList of number-one dance hits of 2010 (UK)\nFMQB: Radio Industry News, Music Industry Updates, Arbitron Ratings, Music News and more!\n[14339,93949]\nGill, Andy (June 12, 2009). \"Album: The Black Eyed Peas, The E.N.D.

It features American musician Nile Rodgers, and was co-written by Sia Furler in collaboration with Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. The track was produced by Elliott Wheeler and The Get Down director, Baz Luhrmann. While it was available to download from the soundtrack upon its release, it was promoted in Italy to contemporary hit radio as a single on August 23, 2016. Various remixes were also released throughout the following month.\nMusically, \"Telepathy\" is a disco track reminiscent of the genre in the 1970s, reflecting the theme of the TV series, which documents the fall of disco and the rise of hip hop in that era. Aguilera's strong vocals were praised by music critics, with one in particular comparing her falsetto melismas to the style of Mariah Carey. \"Telepathy\" became Aguilera's ninth and Rodgers' fourth number-one song on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, respectively. As a thank you gift to her fans, radio, and DJs for playing the track and making it number-one on the chart, Aguilera self-produced a short, disco-themed music video for the song.\nComposed and written by Sia Furler, Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, \"Telepathy\" is a song recorded by Christina Aguilera featuring Nile Rodgers for the accompanying soundtrack to the Netflix musical drama series The Get Down (2016). The Get Down, directed by Australian Baz Luhrmann, is set in The Bronx in the late 1970s and chronicles the fall of disco and the rise of hip hop. Luhrmann, alongside Elliot Wheeler, produced \"Telepathy\", marking the second time he and Aguilera had worked together; Luhrmann directed the 2001 musical film Moulin Rouge! whereby Aguilera was one of the lead acts on the soundtrack single \"Lady Marmalade\". Furler recorded a demo version of the song but it has never been officially released.\nThe track listing for the soundtrack was released on August 4, 2016; Mike Wass of Idolator noted that \"Telepathy\" could possibly be a disco track given that Rodgers is credited as a featured artist and the disco theme of the series. \"Telepathy\" premiered on August 11, the day before the release of the soundtrack and TV series. The song was released in Italy to contemporary hit radio on August 23. Multiple remixes were commissioned and made available for digital download. On September 16, a six-track remix EP was released featuring remixes by Rare Candy, Eric Kupper, Solidisco, Malay & Young Bombs, Tobtok and Moto Blanco. Another remix by Le Youth was released September 30. Daniel Megarry of the Gay Times suggested that the release of the remixes was an effort to boost sales of the track.\n\"Telepathy\" is a disco song which lasts for a duration of three minutes, eleven seconds. The \"dreamy\" and \"euphoric\" instrumentation, provided by Nile Rodgers, Homer Steinweiss, Nick Movshon and Thomas Brenneck, consists of \"vibrant\" strings and horns, drums, brass and harps. PopCrush writer Bradley Stern noted that the addition of Rodgers \"signature joyful, dance floor-friendly\" sound adds a \"touch of authenticity\". Producer Nelson George described the track as being reminiscent of \"1970s vogueing anthems popular at vogue-club balls like the House of LaBeija.\" Entertainment Weekly writer Joey Nolfi placed \"Telepathy\" somewhere in between the compositions of her fifth studio album Back to Basics (2006) and the lead single from her seventh album Lotus, \"Your Body\" (2012).\n\"Telepathy\" garnered a positive response from music critics. Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass was initially underwhelmed by \"Telepathy\" upon its release. According to him, he downloaded the song regardless, and added it to what he calls his \"Upbeat Xtina\" playlist. He writes that a few months later, the song played on shuffle and he realized that he had previously brushed off what he now believed to be one of the best and most underrated songs of 2016. Robbie Daw of the same publication was complimentary of Aguilera's vocal performance, opining that she \"sings beautifully amidst a swirling wall of sound.\" He continued to write that it was a welcome change of tempo following the release of her previous single, \"Change\".\nBradley Stern from PopCrush described the song as a \"shimmering, strut-friendly contribution to the soundtrack\" and"

Then, on May 16, 2014, Carey and Wale premiered their collaboration, revealed to be called \"You Don't Know What to Do\", live during a mini-concert for Today held by Carey.

It went to number two on the US Billboard National Disco Action Top 30 (now the Dance Club Songs chart) for two weeks. It became a crossover hit, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and found worldwide success, reaching the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands and South Africa. A re-release in 1994 allowed the song to reach number four in New Zealand and number five in Iceland.\nThe song was co-written by Alicia Bridges and Susan Hutcheson in 1977 for Bill Lowery, founder of Southern Music. \"I Love the Nightlife\" was the first single produced by Steve Buckingham who was invited to produce the single's parent album entitled Alicia Bridges after he had played guitar on a session by the singer. Bridges suggested to Hutcheson that they write a song with either \"disco\" or \"boogie\" in the title after Bridges saw a current top-ten hit list featuring several songs with dance-oriented titles. The original title of the resultant song: \"Disco 'Round\", became the subtitle under the main title \"I Love the Nightlife\" as Buckingham considered it an R&B number and did not want it labeled disco. Bridges herself would later admit that she had hopes that the song would be received as a Memphis soul number, calling it \"something Al Green might sing\". However it is as a disco classic that the song is most remembered: in an August 26, 1998 MTV countdown of the Top 54 Dance Songs of the Disco Era, \"I Love the Nightlife\" was ranked at number 37.\nIn 1994, the song gained renewed interest after being featured in the film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. It was subsequently re-released and found the best success in New Zealand, where it reached number four in February 1995, 12 places higher than its original peak of number 16. The re-release also reached number five in Iceland and number 11 in Australia. Because of its association with the film (and also because Bridges herself is an open lesbian), the song is closely linked with gay culture. It was remixed for this release.\nA music video was directed by Bruce Gowers.\nIn 1994, a new video was produced featuring Hugo Weaving, star of the film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\n\n\n\n\nLaura Branigan sang the song live on German television and it was included on the very rare compilation album Gut Gestimmt in 1980.\nIn 1995 the song was released by the band Bronski Beat labeled \"I Luv The Nightlife\", which featured two remix versions of the original song and two remix versions of the alternate song Hit That Perfect Beat Boy.\nIt was re-recorded by Latin singer La India and Nuyorican Soul as a track on the soundtrack for the film The Last Days of Disco. This version peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\nIn 2003 it was performed by Taylor Dayne in the television special The Disco Ball.\nIn The Simpsons episode \"Homer's Phobia\", Homer dances to the song. In another episode, \"I'm with Cupid\", Apu taught a parrot to sing \"I Love The Nightlife\" with clever new lyrics to Manjula. Marge was impressed although she hates the song; Homer admits that he hates it as well. It was also featured in the episode \"A Milhouse Divided\", with Luann Van Houten humming it while burning Kirk's storage boxes. It also can be heard in the 2008 episode \"Mypods and Boomsticks\" in Studio 54 when Itchy travels back to Studio 54 in the \"Itchy & Scratchy\" short.\nIn the 1979 horror-comedy film Love At First Bite, the vampire Dracula and his would-be bride dance to the song in a disco. The 2007 DVD release of the movie features a different song in the relevant scene, however the 2015 release by Shout! Factory restored the original song.\nIn the movie So I Married An Axe Murderer, Mike Myers's character quotes the lyrics from the chorus during a conversation with his love interest in the movie.\nIn the Jeopardy! round of the May 29, 2006 episode of Jeopardy!, the last two categories were \"I Love the Nightlife\" (about cities at night) and \"I Got to Boogie\" (about famous escapees).\nFeatured in the film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), and stage musical, Priscilla Queen of the Desert \u2013 the Musical\nFeatured in the short documentary film \"Ladies Please!\" (1995)\nThai 1995 MC Jeans ad show two men"

A Decade of Song, released on 1 November 1999. It peaked within the top ten in many countries, like Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. Billboard listed it as one of the Greatest Songs of 1999.\nIt was written and produced by Swedish producers Andreas Carlsson, Max Martin and Kristian Lundin, who had written a string of hit songs for artists such as NSYNC, Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears.\n\"That's the Way It Is\" starts out in the key of E major with a moderate tempo of 93 beats per minute.  Throughout the verses, the song follows a chord progression of C\u266fm\u2013A\u2013B, and Dion's vocals span from B\u2083 to E\u2085.\nThe song has a bridge, and after the bridge is the chorus repeated, only in the key of A major.\nDion sang it live with NSYNC, during her 1999 CBS Special. She also performed \"That's the Way It Is\" on Top of the Pops on 12 November, the 1999 Billboard Music Awards, the Bambi Awards on 11 December, The Rosie O'Donnell Show on 13 December, The Today Show on 31 December, and on the Let's Talk About Love Tour as the closing song.\nWhen Dion returned to the music scene after her 2 years off in 2002, the song was performed on her promotional tour for the A New Day Has Come album including a second time at The Today Show, The Early Show, and at the concert for World Children's Day.\nIn 2015 for the first time in 13 years, Dion added the song as an acoustic version and later the full length version in her 2nd Las Vegas residency show Celine at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. The song was also performed in Dion's 2017 European tour and her 2018 tour. \"That's the Way it is\" was performed by Dion during her BST Hyde Park concert in London on 5 July 2019. The song is also featured on the Courage World Tour in North America.\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that the danceable \"That's the Way It Is\" works and highlighted it as a standout on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Another editor, Jose F. Promis reviewed the US/South Korea CD maxi single and rated it 3 out 5 stars. He called the song itself a \"cheerful pop nugget\", the album version a \"definitive hit\", and the \"Metro Club Remix\" a \"bubbly dance\" version of the song. Michael Paoletta from Billboard highlighted it on the album, and called it a \"welcome uptempo number\". Another editor, Chuck Taylor also praised \"That's the Way It Is\". He wrote that Dion at last \"ups the tempo with the irresistible\" first single. According to Taylor, this new track, a joyful ode to holding the faith but allowing love to take its course when it's ready, matches Dion with a new team of collaborators, consistent hitmakers: Max Martin, Kristian Lundin and Andreas Carlsson. \"Replete with a festive mandolin and a midtempo beat to bring new heights to her as-ever splendid vocal,\" this song is \"destined to enrapture\" top forty and AC the first time through, at last stripping away mainstream radio's gripe that Dion is \"too adult\". He said that, youthful and yet elegant, and glowing brightly with warmth, the song also represents a bold step forward for Martin, who is best known for his work with chart-topping youth acts. All in all, \"That's the Way It Is\" is \"one of the most compelling radio releases yet\" from \"one of the core voices of the decade.\" Can't Stop the Pop stated that the song \"doesn't sound like it's trying to be Britney Spears; it sounds like the authentic evolution of a superstar \u2013 this is a Celine Dion song through and through \u2013 and it's hard to imagine it being performed by anyone else\".\nThe song became a hit, going to number 1 on the adult contemporary charts in Canada and the United States, reaching the top ten in other countries all over the world. It was Dion's first airplay-only single that charted on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 6 (number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay). The commercial single was released nine months later as a double A-side with \"I Want You to Need Me\", reaching number 62 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales.\nIt ranked at number 12 on decade-end list of US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart for 2000\u20132009. The song spent 1 week at number 1 at the top and an eventual 85 weeks or 1 and a half years on the said chart. It became one of the longest-running single in"

It was released as the album's lead single on 11 March 2002. \"A New Day Has Come\" is a piano-driven ballad in  time. However, the midtempo radio version, co-produced by Christian B & Marc Dold of (S.A.F.) along with Ric Wake, converted the song into  time and was released as the lead single. Both versions are included on the album.\nDion revealed that the song represents the birth of her child. It received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Dion's vocals and its uplifting lyrics. The music video was directed by Dave Meyers and premiered in March 2002. The song was a success around the world, reaching top ten on the Canadian Singles Chart, UK Singles Chart and many European charts; while reaching number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping for 21 weeks the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.

During the time away, she focused on her personal life and gave birth to her first child. After two years, Dion announced her return and admitted she was eager to get back into the studio. \"I couldn't wait to go back into the recording studio. And, I loved the songs that people wrote for me on this album.

Her then 13-month-old son Rene-Charles Dion Angelil is the main subject of the love song, with Dion singing: \"Where there was weakness I've found my strength/All in the eyes of a boy.\"\nAccording to herself, the song is about her son: \"For me, this represents the birth of my child.

Bernardo and their producers Mattman & Robin. It was released by Kidinakorner and Interscope Records on July 17, 2018, serving as the lead single from the band's fourth studio album, Origins (2018), as well as the seasonal anthem of the 2018 ESPN College Football. It became their fifth number one song on the US Hot Rock Songs chart.\nLead singer Dan Reynolds noted that \"Natural\" is about \"finding yourself and being willing and able to stand up to whatever adversity comes your way\". He said in a press release announcing the song: \"Living in a dog-eat-dog world can bring out the worst in you, and sometimes, the best. It would be a lie to tell you I haven't become somewhat skeptical about some things in the last decade of my life. However, I believe that when you truly learn to love yourself, the judging eyes and hateful words become meaningless.\"\nThe song was chosen by ESPN as the anthem of the 2018 College Football season. It is the second time that an Imagine Dragons song was chosen, the first being \"Roots\" in 2015. \"'Natural' embodies the energy, spirit and drama of each team's journey to the College Football Playoff, and that is why it was chosen as this year's anthem,\" said Emeka Ofodile, ESPN vice president of sports marketing. It is also part of the soundtrack for EA Sports' NHL 19.\n\"Natural\" is a pop rock song which features a \"mix of explosive drums and inspiring lyrics\", with \"stadium-rocking instrumentation\" over the chorus.\nMarkos Papadatos of Digital Journal regarded \"Natural\" as a \"well-crafted and well-produced song\", writing that \"Reynolds' voice is impressive, raw and powerful\", and that the song \"garners two thumbs up\". Sam Tornow of Billboard described the song as \"ferocious\" and \"smash-mouth\". Mike Wass of Idolator named the song a \"radio-ready anthem\", expecting it to be \"another smash\" following the success of the band's third studio album Evolve (2017). Tiana Timmerberg of Radio.com called the song \"energetic and inspiring\", deeming it \"a feel-good jam with positive and empowering lyrics\".\nA music video for the song was released on August 24, 2018. It depicts frontman Dan Reynolds as the apparent owner of a spooky house including shots of a woman in a bathtub, the same woman being pursued by other inhabitants of the house and an abnormally tall man resembling Slenderman, a supposed funeral for the woman, Wayne Sermon, Ben McKee and Daniel Platzman fading into dust, Reynolds digging a grave and burying the woman alive, and other shots no the house and its inhabitants, along with a clip of a lion mauling a zebra.\nIts music video has received over 410 million views and 4 million likes as of March 2021.\nOn July 19, 2018, Imagine Dragons made a live television debut of the single on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The performance featured a guitar solo by lead guitarist Wayne Sermon that expanded on the studio recording.\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nMattman & Robin \u2013 production, engineering\nSerban Ghenea \u2013 mixing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaherty, Kevin (July 17, 2018). \"ESPN picks pump-up song for the 2018 college football season\". 247Sports.

However, the midtempo radio version, co-produced by Christian B & Marc Dold of (S.A.F.) along with Ric Wake, converted the song into  time and was released as the lead single. Both versions are included on the album.\nDion revealed that the song represents the birth of her child. It received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Dion's vocals and its uplifting lyrics. The music video was directed by Dave Meyers and premiered in March 2002. The song was a success around the world, reaching top ten on the Canadian Singles Chart, UK Singles Chart and many European charts; while reaching number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping for 21 weeks the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. The song was later included on compilations My Love: Essential Collection, Complete Best, Ultimate Box in 2008 as well as The Best So Far... 2018 Tour Edition in 2018.\nIn 2000, Dion announced that she was taking a break from her career. During the time away, she focused on her personal life and gave birth to her first child. After two years, Dion announced her return and admitted she was eager to get back into the studio. \"I couldn't wait to go back into the recording studio. And, I loved the songs that people wrote for me on this album. Those songs became even closer to me because, the fact that I took two years off, they wrote songs for me that were even closer to my emotions. I had things to talk about. I had things to sing about. It was a fun adventure, no pressure, relaxed, smooth, powerful but controlled. I really had a wonderful time. And to see my friends again, it was great.\"\nThe single is her first in English since 2000's \"I Want You to Need Me\". \"A New Day Has Come\" was released on 6 February 2002 to radio stations in the US. It was released on 11 March 2002 internationally. In October 2008, \"A New Day Has Come\" was included on the compilation My Love: Essential Collection.\n\"A New Day Has Come\" was written by Aldo Nova and Stephan Moccio and produced by Walter Afanasieff, Nova  and Ric Wake (the latter only produced the \"radio edit\"). The song also features additional production from Richie Jones, Christian B, and Marc Dold. The song has two versions: the piano-driven ballad in  time and the midtempo radio version in common time. Both versions are available on the album.  Both versions of the song are written in the key of F\u266f major.  The original version of the song features a slow tempo of 40 beats per minute, while the radio remix features one of 92 beats per minute.\nLyrically, the song is about the world thinking that she has it all, but she draws us in to the sadness she must have experienced with life issues, such as her older husband being ill and knowing that she had problems conceiving a baby. Her then 13-month-old son Rene-Charles Dion Angelil is the main subject of the love song, with Dion singing: \"Where there was weakness I've found my strength/All in the eyes of a boy.\"\nAccording to herself, the song is about her son: \"For me, this represents the birth of my child. Nothing can ever come close to that. But it can mean different things for anyone who has to find strength again. I think it's very positive.\"\n\"A New Day Has Come\" garnered mostly stellar reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic highlighted the song. Barnes & Noble's Editorial review wrote that \"It marks Celine Dion's return to recording after a lengthy maternity leave, and charts the pop diva's growth as an artist and as a woman. Although Dion's songs have always been about the power of love she wasn't mincing words when she titled her 1997 blockbuster Let's Talk About Love, maternal rather than romantic sentiment fuels her fire this time out. As she gushes on the uplifting title song.\" Chuck Taylor from Billboard wrote that the life-affirming \"A New Day Has Come\" \"comes off like a gentle exhale against the world's ills.\" The Ric Wake"

It features guest vocals from her then-boyfriend, Blake Shelton. The song was written by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Shelton and busbee, while production was handled by busbee and Eric Valentine. It was recorded during the summer months, with the song title leaking in August 2017. The song was eventually released for digital download and streaming as the lead single from the album by Interscope on September 22, 2017. It was influenced by popular holiday music from Stefani's childhood and marks Stefani and Shelton's second collaboration following their duet \"Go Ahead and Break My Heart\" in 2016. A Christmas track, the song includes country and pop music elements, with lyrics describing a romantic holiday season.\n\"You Make It Feel Like Christmas\" received positive to mixed reviews from music critics. Some believed that the song was successful lyrically and would ultimately become a modern Christmas classic, while other critics found it inferior to the rest of You Make It Feel Like Christmas. In the United States, the song failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100, and instead peaked at number two on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 extension chart. It reached the top 10 of the Adult Contemporary charts for both Canada and the US. In countries such as Germany and Switzerland, it became Stefani's first track to chart in years. On the UK Singles Chart, it served as her first solo top 100 single since 2007 and has sold 66,000 copies by 2019. In 2020, the single was certified Gold by the RIAA in the US.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by long-time Stefani collaborator Sophie Muller and released in November 2018. It features scenes of Stefani and Shelton partaking in various holiday-themed activities interspersed with ones of the two performing the song, accompanied by a big band and children dancers. Stefani's looks in the video were described as reminiscent of American actress Marilyn Monroe. The song has been performed on various television series, such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Late Late Show with James Corden and The Voice, as well as on the 2017 American holiday special Gwen Stefani's You Make It Feel Like Christmas.\nAfter the release of Stefani's third solo album, This Is What the Truth Feels Like (2016), she announced her plans to release new music by the end of 2017 in July of that year. Besides the announcement, she had no further details. Following a nature walk that occurred at Shelton's residential estate in Oklahoma, Stefani felt inspired to write Christmas music and began work on a track that later became \"Christmas Eve\". The material created for You Make It Feel Like Christmas was recorded during the summer months of 2017, after Stefani scheduled joint studio and songwriting sessions with Justin Tranter and busbee. The latter of the three collaborated with Stefani following a suggestion from Shelton that she would work well with him. Stefani was pressured to create a holiday album by busbee that was \"raw and punk and sort of classical at the same time\"; accordingly, Stefani listened to the favorite holiday albums of her childhood, such as Vince Guaraldi's A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) and Emmylou Harris's Light of the Stable (1979), for inspiration.\nOn August 2, 2017, the titles of several unreleased tracks from Stefani, including \"Christmas Eve\", \"My Gift Is You\", \"Under the Christmas Lights\" and \"You Make It Feel Like Christmas\", first leaked onto the internet when they appeared as published works on BMI and GEMA, American and German music databases, respectively. Because of the titles, music critics suggested that Stefani may have been recording a holiday album, due for release in 2017. On September 18 that year, the singer took to her social media accounts and claimed that she \"had something big planned for the holidays\", and would release more information in the near future. The next day, Stefani revealed that she had recorded a Christmas album, confirming its title as You Make It Feel Like Christmas, and stating that the title track would be released as the lead single. It was written by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Shelton and busbee, while production was handled by busbee and Eric Valentine.\n\"You Make It Feel Like Christmas\" was sent"

It was released as the album's second single on 9 August 2002 and was also featured in the film Stuart Little 2. The song was written and produced by Kristian Lundin and Andreas Carlsson, who already worked with Dion in 1999 on \"That's the Way It Is\".\n\"I'm Alive\" is an uplifting midtempo song, where Celine declares she is alive, fulfilled as a mother, and \"in love.\" The music video was directed by Dave Meyers between 24\u201325 May 2002 and premiered in June 2002. There were two versions made: with or without the Stuart Little 2 movie scenes. \"I'm Alive\" became a worldwide hit, reaching the top ten in many countries. It was certified platinum in Belgium (50,000) and gold in France (250,000).\nWhile working on the album, Celine commented, \"I couldn't wait to go back into the recording studio. And, I loved the songs that people wrote for me on this album. Those songs became even closer to me because, the fact that I took two years off, they wrote songs for me that were even closer to my emotions. I had things to talk about. I had things to sing about. It was a fun adventure, no pressure, relaxed, smooth, powerful but controlled. I really had a wonderful time. And to see my friends again, it was great.\"\n\"I'm Alive\" was released as the album's second single on 12 August 2002. For radio release, the song was re-worked by Humberto Gatica. Epic Records moved forward with the \"Humberto Gatica\" version as the main version. His version was released on the Stuart Little 2 soundtrack as well as promotional and commercial CD singles.\nAlthough in October 2008 the album version of \"I'm Alive\" was included on My Love: Essential Collection, the new remix by Laurent Wolf was released to promote it in France. In January 2009, further promotional remixes were made by Maurice Joshua for U.S. clubs.\n\"I'm Alive\" was written by Kristian Lundin and Andreas Carlsson and produced by Lundin. They worked with Celine before writing her 1999 hit \"That's the Way It Is.\" It is an uplifting midtempo song, where Celine declares she is alive, fulfilled as a mother, and \"in love.\"\nThe song is written in the key of E\u266d major with a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute.  Dion's vocals span from A\u266d\u2083 to D\u2085 in the song.\nWhile reviewing the Stuart Little 2 soundtrack, William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that \"Celine Dion occupies the position taken by Trisha Yearwood on the soundtrack to Stuart Little in 1999, singing an upbeat rhythm number.\" Another editor, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the song uplifting and highlighted it; in his review for album he called the song a \"hitworthy uptempo gem\". ABC's RollerCoaster review was positive, commenting that \"this is the type of music you play in the background when your having a good laugh with friends or a nice tea with family. It's the kind of song you sing along to and slowly get wrapped in it.\" Chuck Taylor from Billboard said that \"I'm Alive\" demonstrates a stylistic \"left turn, with its throbbing tribal rhythms and a loose, sky-grazing vocal from Dion.\" The \"percolating\" Humberto Gatica Mix \"adds juice\" to the album version, while the uptempo Wake Up Mix, with assistance from Ric Wake and Richie Jones, is Dion's most \"inspired and festive\" remix to date, with Blondie's \"Heart of Glass\" woven into the beat to \"splendid effect\". Neal Sky of Pop Dirt named it a \"bubblegum-radio-song\". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it one of \"the album's standout tracks\", naming it \"an uplifting midtempo number.\" Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic said that Dion is \"full of energy and blasting her way forward with confidence is the order of the day\". He added that it \"could almost be declared as her signature, biographical anthem, if it were not for all those mega hits of the 90s.\" Matt Wilson of UK Mix was positive towards the song, stating that \"this new offering is actually an uplifting song that will no doubt be a hit single for her. This is one of the best singles to date.\"\nThe song proved to be successful in many European countries. On the Austrian Singles Chart, the song debuted at number 71. The following week, it climbed from number 71 to number 23. In its fourth week, it reached a peak of number five, where it remained for four consecutive weeks. The song spent twenty-two consecutive weeks on the chart. On the Swedish Singles Chart, the song also reached number 5,"

It was written by Williams and Gary Barlow, sampling a riff from \"Eurodans\" by Terje Olsen. The song was Williams's first UK number-one single since \"Radio\" in 2004, and was deliberately produced in the style of other 2012 chart-toppers in a calculated attempt to re-establish his presence in the UK charts.\nThe track premiered on BBC Radio 1 just days before the station removed Williams from their playlist, deeming him no longer relevant to their target audience. Williams claimed to be gutted by the decision, citing Radio 1 as a pop star's \"main oxygen\". When the song reached number one without Radio 1 airplay, the singer thanked the station, who \"have supported me for a long, long time and I'm very grateful to them. Oh, and I can still have number ones without them!\"\nThe track was originally rumoured to be titled \"Vertigo\". Williams said of the track: \"It's a summer song, very much in a similar vein to 'Rock DJ', about a girl who thinks she's great. And she might be, but she's a bit nefarious with her ways. Some songs take an age to write and some songs just fall out of your mouth completely formed, and you don't have to think about it. I don't know why that fell out of my mouth and out of my brain at that particular time \u2013 it just did.\" On 10 September, Williams debuted \"Candy\" on Radio 2's Breakfast Show with host Chris Evans. The official artwork for the track features a model of Williams's head covered in pink and red spots.\n\"Candy\" was written by Robbie Williams, Gary Barlow and Terje Olsen, while production was handled by Jacknife Lee. The song samples Norwegian producer Todd Terje\u2018s single \"Eurodans\". In the hook, he uses nursery rhymes about the plague (Ring a Ring o\u2019 Roses) and taxes. \"Hey ho here she goes/ Either a little too high or a little too low/ Got no self-esteem and vertigo/ Cause she thinks she's made of candy,\" Williams chants on the chorus. The song contains melodic elements of the nursery rhyme Ring a Ring o' Roses and even contains the title of the rhyme at the start of the second verse.\n\nLewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song 4 out of 5 stars, writing that \"'Candy' doesn't touch the dizzying heights of 'Rock DJ' or 'Angels', but it's also far from his worst song to date.\" Corner also wrote: \"Robbie chants on a bouncy, playground chant of a chorus brassier than his stage persona \u2013 and there within lies the charm.\" John Bush of AllMusic wrote that \"The trailer single 'Candy' is a trite, uptempo track with a sing-song chorus but not much of a shelf life, it's the perfect radio hit.\" Sam Lanksy of Idolator wrote the song \"is sprightly and spunky with a clever hook \u2014 arguably the best sweets-related diss since Annie's 'Chewing Gum'.\" Tom Hocknell of BBC Music called it \"catchier than Velcro, although it\u2019s unclear why anyone needs to own it \u2013 after the second listen it owns you. It\u2019s eager to please, certainly.\"\nAlexis Petridis of The Guardian was less positive, writing that \"[...] It's so desperate to be a smash hit that it ends up sounding like one of those novelty singles that used to blight the September charts, bought by returning holidaymakers with rosy memories of the hotel disco; all it's lacking is an accompanying dance.\" Philip Matusavage of musicOMH also gave the song a mixed review, writing that \"It's a neat pr\u00e9cis of the problems facing Robbie in 2012. Its bouncy dancehall brass is undeniably and infectiously catchy but it\u2019s also short-lived; the song leaves no impression at its end.\" Kitty Empire of The Observer observed that \"it would better suit a boy band in a Caribbean time warp. But somehow, it looks as if it will re-establish Williams's presence in the charts today, regardless.\"\nIn Germany, \"Candy\" broke an airplay record for the most plays in a week. It peaked at number 3 on the main chart. In Austria, the song was a success, debuting and peaking, for three consecutive weeks, at number 4 on the \u00d63 Austria Top 40 chart. \"Candy\" was a growing success in the Netherlands, debuting at number 27 on the Dutch Top 40 chart. After six weeks climbing the charts, the song entered the top-ten, reaching number 6, on 10 November 2012. In the Dutch Mega Top 100 \"Candy\" reached number 1 on 17 November 2012. It reached top 10 in more than 20 countries, and Top 40 in other territories including Japan and New Zealand.\nIn his native UK, despite BBC Radio 1 not putting it on their playlist, \"Candy\" gathered over 10,000"

The song was written by Aldo Nova and Stephan Moccio and produced by Walter Afanasieff and Nova. It was released as the album's lead single on 11 March 2002. \"A New Day Has Come\" is a piano-driven ballad in  time. However, the midtempo radio version, co-produced by Christian B & Marc Dold of (S.A.F.) along with Ric Wake, converted the song into  time and was released as the lead single. Both versions are included on the album.\nDion revealed that the song represents the birth of her child. It received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Dion's vocals and its uplifting lyrics. The music video was directed by Dave Meyers and premiered in March 2002. The song was a success around the world, reaching top ten on the Canadian Singles Chart, UK Singles Chart and many European charts; while reaching number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping for 21 weeks the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. The song was later included on compilations My Love: Essential Collection, Complete Best, Ultimate Box in 2008 as well as The Best So Far... 2018 Tour Edition in 2018.\nIn 2000, Dion announced that she was taking a break from her career. During the time away, she focused on her personal life and gave birth to her first child. After two years, Dion announced her return and admitted she was eager to get back into the studio. \"I couldn't wait to go back into the recording studio. And, I loved the songs that people wrote for me on this album. Those songs became even closer to me because, the fact that I took two years off, they wrote songs for me that were even closer to my emotions. I had things to talk about. I had things to sing about. It was a fun adventure, no pressure, relaxed, smooth, powerful but controlled. I really had a wonderful time. And to see my friends again, it was great.\"\nThe single is her first in English since 2000's \"I Want You to Need Me\". \"A New Day Has Come\" was released on 6 February 2002 to radio stations in the US. It was released on 11 March 2002 internationally. In October 2008, \"A New Day Has Come\" was included on the compilation My Love: Essential Collection.\n\"A New Day Has Come\" was written by Aldo Nova and Stephan Moccio and produced by Walter Afanasieff, Nova  and Ric Wake (the latter only produced the \"radio edit\"). The song also features additional production from Richie Jones, Christian B, and Marc Dold. The song has two versions: the piano-driven ballad in  time and the midtempo radio version in common time. Both versions are available on the album.  Both versions of the song are written in the key of F\u266f major.  The original version of the song features a slow tempo of 40 beats per minute, while the radio remix features one of 92 beats per minute.\nLyrically, the song is about the world thinking that she has it all, but she draws us in to the sadness she must have experienced with life issues, such as her older husband being ill and knowing that she had problems conceiving a baby. Her then 13-month-old son Rene-Charles Dion Angelil is the main subject of the love song, with Dion singing: \"Where there was weakness I've found my strength/All in the eyes of a boy.\"\nAccording to herself, the song is about her son: \"For me, this represents the birth of my child.

Barnes & Noble's Editorial review wrote that \"It marks Celine Dion's return to recording after a lengthy maternity leave, and charts the pop diva's growth as an artist and as a woman.

It was released on 19 February 1996 as the first single in North America and as the second single in the United Kingdom on 20 May 1996. \"Because You Loved Me\" was written by Diane Warren and produced by David Foster, and served as the theme song from the 1996 film Up Close & Personal, starring Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\"Because You Loved Me\" received critical acclaim and became a worldwide hit, reaching number one in the United States, Canada and Australia, and reaching top ten in many other countries. In the United States alone, it has sold over two million copies. \"Because You Loved Me\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. The single has sold over 5 million copies in its first 6 months of availability worldwide.\n\"Because You Loved Me\" was written by Diane Warren and produced by David Foster. Both Warren and Foster worked with Dion on her previous English-language albums. The song is a downtempo pop ballad in which the singer thanks a loyal loved one for guiding, encouraging, and protecting her throughout her life, and making her who she is today. Warren said that the song was a tribute to her father. \"Because You Loved Me\" served as the theme song from the 1996 film Up Close & Personal, starring Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. However, the song was not included on the film's soundtrack. \"Because You Loved Me\" was released as the first single from Falling into You in North America. It was issued as the second single in the United Kingdom (May 1996), after \"Falling into You\".\nThe song is written in the key of D\u266d major with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute.  Dion's vocals span from A\u266d\u2083 to E\u266d\u2085 in the song.  The final chorus is set in E\u266d major.\n\"Because You Loved Me\" received positive reviews from most music critics. The Advocate described it as a \"big ballad\" and an \"emotional roller coaster\". Senior editor of AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised ballads like \"Because You Loved Me\" on Falling into You. Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that \"Because You Loved Me\" is, \"rife with grand romance, larger-than-life production, and a climax that is best described as the musical equivalent to 4th of July fireworks\". Another Billboard editor, Paul Verna also highlighted the chart-topping \"Because You Loved Me\". Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report wrote, \"How about this daring prediction: It'll be one of the first major hits of 1996! An expected Celine Dion media blitz this spring is certain to take her and this project far into the next galaxy\". The Hartford Courant noted it as a \"luxurious love song\". Music Week rated it five out of five, adding that it \"tugs the heartstrings like a surefire winner.\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the song, calling it this year's \"Wind Beneath My Wings\". Richmond Times-Dispatch picked \"Because You Loved Me\" as one of the best songs on Falling into You. Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic described it as a \"beautiful, soulful ballad in her own inimitable way\" and noted that Dion \"turns on the power over the final choruses.\"\nIn the United States, \"Because You Loved Me\" became Dion's second number one single, after \"The Power of Love\" in 1994. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six consecutive weeks and ended the reign at the top of \"One Sweet Day\" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men. \"Because You Loved Me\" also topped the Adult Contemporary Singles for nineteen weeks and set a record for most weeks at number one on this chart. In the following years, only five songs spent more time at the top, including Dion's own \"A New Day Has Come\" in 2002 (twenty-one weeks). \"Because You Loved Me\" also reached number one on other US charts, including Hot 100 Airplay for fourteen weeks, Adult Top 40 for twelve weeks, Hot Singles Sales for six weeks and Mainstream Top 40 for five weeks. In April 1996, it was certified Platinum by the RIAA for selling one million copies in the US. As of April\u00a02012, \"Because You Loved Me\" has sold 1,343,000 physical copies and 704,000 digital units, for a total of 2,047,000 copies. According to Billboard,"

The song was written and produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, while Lange and his then-wife, country singer Shania Twain did the backing vocals. Lyrically, the song speaks about motherly love and fear of losing one's mother. It was released as the album's third and last commercial single on 18 November 2002 by Columbia Records and Epic Records.\nThe song received favorable reviews from music critics, who called it a \"heartfelt and emotional song\", while praising Dion's performance. The \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\" music video was directed by Chris Applebaum between 12\u201313 October 2002 in Paris, France, and premiered in November 2002. The song performed moderately on the charts, peaking inside the top fifty in the countries that it charted, but it did not match the success of previous singles.\n\"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\" was written and produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, who already worked with Dion in 1999 on \"If Walls Could Talk.\" Lange and his then-wife, country singer Shania Twain did the backing vocals. The song runs to 5 minutes 19 seconds with a radio edit of 4 minutes 23 seconds. It was recorded at Studio Piccolo and released 18 November 2002.\nLyrically, the devastatingly emotional ballad speaks about the absolute love between a child and her mother. \"There is no other love like a mother's love for her child,\" she sings. C\u00e9line first heard the Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange song three years ago [1999] and turn it down. \"Now, being a mother, I found the strength to sing it, but it was hard,\" she said. Its lesson? \"Never wait too long to tell someone how you feel,\" she answered.\nIn October 2008, \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\" was included on the European version of My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection greatest hits.\nBarnes & Noble's editorial review called it \"a heartfelt, country-tinged song.\" Chuck Taylor from Billboard criticized the choice of the third single, \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word),\" a ballad relegated solely to adult contemporary radio stations. He noticed that the song is \"devastatingly beautiful,\" offering a loving tribute to one's mother at death's door and that Dion \"delivers it with a heaving helping of passion, emotionally drawing one's attention to the devotional message.\" Although he felt that many will connect to the loss of a parent, on a commercial level, this was a disappointing decision. Mike Ross of Jam! Canoe wrote, \"Celine is at her lovey-doveyest in Mutt Lange's Goodbye's (The Saddest Word), helped by not one, but two soaring key changes in the same song, which is then launched into a high Earth orbit of melodrama by an orchestra that would make John Williams blush with envy.\" Neal Sky of Pop Dirt perceived that she\u2019s singing now such sweet, sweet verses like \"I found it all in the eyes of a boy (in A New Day Has Come\" or an even sweeter combination with her subject: \"there\u2019s is no other love like a mother\u2019s for her child\" penned by Robert \"Mutt\" Lange. Commenting for Rolling Stone in May 2002, Rob Sheffield said of the Mutt Lange composition it is \"sure to inspire many hours of dull debate with Bernie Taupin.\" The reviewer also alluded to Dion's voice as \"just furniture polish\".

The song's lyrics explore feelings of longing from the point of view of an abandoned lover.\nIn 1989, Irish singer Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor recorded a version of the song for her second studio album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got. It was released as the album's second single in early 1990 and became a worldwide hit. O'Connor co-produced the record with Nellee Hooper, and its music video, directed by John Maybury, received heavy rotation on MTV. In December 1990, Billboard named \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" as the \"#1 World Single\" of 1990 at its first Billboard Music Awards. This version is written and composed in the key of F major.\nPrince released his own rendition of \"Nothing Compares 2 U\", with Rosie Gaines on guest vocals in 1993. This live version of the song was included on his compilation album The Hits/The B-Sides. His original 1984 studio recording of the song was eventually released in 2018 as a single and later on the 2019 posthumous compilation Originals.\nIn 1985, the funk band The Family released their only album, The Family. It contained songs written by Prince with \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" being one of those songs. The song appeared more-or-less as filler music on their album and was not released as a single and received little recognition.  Prince had earlier recorded the song in 1984, which went unreleased until 2018 as a posthumous single released digitally in April of that year.\nSinead O'Connor recorded the song for her second album I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, released in 1990, where she and producer Nellee Hooper gave it a completely new arrangement. The song became an international hit for O'Connor.\nPrince took no interest in performing it in concerts; however, in the years after O'Connor turned it into a hit in 1990, he began performing the song live. He performed duets with Rosie Gaines in concert and subsequently had a live performance released on compilation albums: 1993's The Hits/The B-Sides, and the 2006 Ultimate Prince. He also recorded a solo version for his concert film Rave Un2 the Year 2000, as well as for his 2002 live album One Nite Alone... Live!.\nThe song received favorable reviews from most music critics. Bill Lamb from About.com wrote that O'Connor's \"emotional, gutsy performance made it a classic. Painful loss meets stunning vocal beauty with a perfectly understated instrumental arrangement.\" Matthew Hocter from Albumism described it as a song \"deeply rooted in emotion and despair which would go on to certify O'Connor and that song as one of music history's most unforgettable moments.\" AllMusic editor Steve Huey called the song \"stunning\" and noted its \"remarkable intimacy\". Jodi Cleesattle from American Eagle wrote that \"there is pain in Sinead O'Connor's voice, and there probably always will be.\" She noted that \"loneliness and longing\" are highlighted on the song, adding that O'Connor's voice \"fits the song perfectly. Her vocals soar and leap unexpectedly but gracefully, making, the ballad, the loveliest of love songs.\" Bill Coleman from Billboard described it as a \"brilliant interpretation of the melancholic lament.\" Ernest Hardy from Cashbox called it a \"genuine tear-jerker\". Greg Sandow for Entertainment Weekly said that it is a song \"about how to carry on after losing love\". \n Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger noted it as a \"very moving track\", and added that it \"captures the stasis, anger and devastation of a bad break-up with awful accuracy.\" He also complimented the music \"whose stately, sympathetic pulse gives O\u2019Connor the canvas she needs to be so devastating.\" Tom Moon from Knight Ridder said she \"adapts the breathy approach of a torch singer.\" A reviewer from Los Angeles Times noted that the singer \"match raw emotion with spare sounds\" on \"the quiet, desperate, lovelorn beauty\". Pan-European magazine Music & Media stated that out of all the recent covers of Prince songs - Chaka Khan's I Feel For You, Tom Jones' Kiss and Simple Minds' Sign 'O' The Times - \"this is definitely the most convincing.\" The reviewer noted further that originally recorded by Minneapolis band The Family for their 1985 debut album, \"O'Connor's emotionally charged version has immediate appeal\", and is \"destined to be her biggest hit to date.\""

It was released by Relativity Records in 1999 in both 12 inch and CD format. The song is produced by The Beatnuts and features materialistic raps by Juju and Psycho Les, as well as a chorus performed by Yellaklaw. The track's fast-paced Latin beat samples \"Hi-Jack\" by Enoch Light.\n\"Watch Out Now\" is the most commercially successful Beatnuts single; it reached #84 on the Billboard Hot 100 making it the second Beatnuts single to appear on the pop chart. It additionally appeared on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart and Canadian Singles Chart. Its popularity landed it on two Beatnuts hits compilations: Beatnuts Forever and Classic Nuts, Vol. 1. It can additionally be found on hip hop compilations including 1999's The Source Presents: Hip Hop Hits, Vol. 3, 2000's Louder Than Ever, Vol. 1 and 2004's Hip Hop Forever, Vol. 2. A \"Watch Out Now\" remix produced by Trouble Men was released as a single in France, but did not receive music video treatment as the original version did. Diane Martel directed the \"Watch Out Now\" music video. The song lyrics deal with the ability to \"watch out\" in the present time \"now\" and were considered lyrically very advanced for their time.\nIn 2002, Jennifer Lopez released \"Jenny from the Block\", a single that allegedly stole the Beatnuts' sample of \"Hi-Jack\" by Enoch Light (a song originally written by Spanish musician Fernando Arbex and was recorded by the group Barrab\u00e1s for their 1974 album \u00a1Soltad a Barrab\u00e1s!). The Beatnuts were angry that Lopez and her song's producers, The Trackmasters and Cory Rooney, were able to top The Beatnuts' commercial success with a purportedly unoriginal song. The Beatnuts expressed their displeasure with Lopez and her producers on the 2004 song \"Confused Rappers\" as well as through various interviews.\n\n\"Watch Out Now (Clean)\" (2:54)\n\"Watch Out Now (Real)\" (2:54)\n\"Watch Out Now (Instrumental)\" (2:54)\n\"Turn It Out (Clean)\" (4:34)\n\"Turn It Out (Real)\" (4:36)\n\"Turn It Out (Instrumental)\" (4:32)\n\n\"Watch Out Now (Clean)\" (2:54)\n\"Watch Out Now (Real)\" (2:54)\n\"Watch Out Now (Instrumental)\" (2:54)\n\"Turn It Out (Clean)\" (4:31)\n\"Turn It Out (Real)\" (4:31)\n\"Turn It Out (Instrumental)\" (4:31)\n\n\"Watch Out Now (Real)\" (2:54)\n\"Watch Out Now (Instrumental)\" (2:54)\n\n\"Watch Out Now (Trouble Men Rip-Off Remix)\" (5:45)\n\"Watch Out Now\" (2:53)\n\"Watch Out Now (Trouble Men Rip-Off Edit)\" (3:40)\n\"Milk Me Review\".

The song was written by Aldo Nova and Stephan Moccio and produced by Walter Afanasieff and Nova. It was released as the album's lead single on 11 March 2002. \"A New Day Has Come\" is a piano-driven ballad in  time. However, the midtempo radio version, co-produced by Christian B & Marc Dold of (S.A.F.) along with Ric Wake, converted the song into  time and was released as the lead single. Both versions are included on the album.\nDion revealed that the song represents the birth of her child. It received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Dion's vocals and its uplifting lyrics. The music video was directed by Dave Meyers and premiered in March 2002. The song was a success around the world, reaching top ten on the Canadian Singles Chart, UK Singles Chart and many European charts; while reaching number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping for 21 weeks the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. The song was later included on compilations My Love: Essential Collection, Complete Best, Ultimate Box in 2008 as well as The Best So Far... 2018 Tour Edition in 2018.\nIn 2000, Dion announced that she was taking a break from her career. During the time away, she focused on her personal life and gave birth to her first child. After two years, Dion announced her return and admitted she was eager to get back into the studio. \"I couldn't wait to go back into the recording studio. And, I loved the songs that people wrote for me on this album. Those songs became even closer to me because, the fact that I took two years off, they wrote songs for me that were even closer to my emotions. I had things to talk about. I had things to sing about. It was a fun adventure, no pressure, relaxed, smooth, powerful but controlled. I really had a wonderful time. And to see my friends again, it was great.\"\nThe single is her first in English since 2000's \"I Want You to Need Me\". \"A New Day Has Come\" was released on 6 February 2002 to radio stations in the US. It was released on 11 March 2002 internationally. In October 2008, \"A New Day Has Come\" was included on the compilation My Love: Essential Collection.\n\"A New Day Has Come\" was written by Aldo Nova and Stephan Moccio and produced by Walter Afanasieff, Nova  and Ric Wake (the latter only produced the \"radio edit\"). The song also features additional production from Richie Jones, Christian B, and Marc Dold. The song has two versions: the piano-driven ballad in  time and the midtempo radio version in common time. Both versions are available on the album.  Both versions of the song are written in the key of F\u266f major.  The original version of the song features a slow tempo of 40 beats per minute, while the radio remix features one of 92 beats per minute.\nLyrically, the song is about the world thinking that she has it all, but she draws us in to the sadness she must have experienced with life issues, such as her older husband being ill and knowing that she had problems conceiving a baby. Her then 13-month-old son Rene-Charles Dion Angelil is the main subject of the love song, with Dion singing: \"Where there was weakness I've found my strength/All in the eyes of a boy.\"\nAccording to herself, the song is about her son: \"For me, this represents the birth of my child. Nothing can ever come close to that. But it can mean different things for anyone who has to find strength again. I think it's very positive.\"\n\"A New Day Has Come\" garnered mostly stellar reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic highlighted the song. Barnes & Noble's Editorial review wrote that \"It marks Celine Dion's return to recording after a lengthy maternity leave, and charts the pop diva's growth as an artist and as a woman. Although Dion's songs have always been about the power of love she wasn't mincing words when she titled her 1997 blockbuster Let's Talk About Love, maternal rather than romantic sentiment fuels her fire this time out. As she gushes on the uplifting title song.\" Chuck Taylor from Billboard wrote that the life-affirming \"A New Day Has Come\" \"comes off like a gentle exhale against the world's ills.\" The Ric Wake"

The song was released as a digital download on 21 October 2019 as the second single from his debut studio album Snacks (Supersize). The song peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart.\nOn 15 August 2019, Jones spoke to Capital Breakfast about his then upcoming debut album Snacks (Supersize) (2019), confirming collaborations with Raye and Ella Henderson for the album. Jones described the latter as having an \"amazing voice\". Then in an interview on 17 August Jones spoke to The Big Top 40's Will Manning where he revealed that the Henderson collaboration was called \"This is Real.\" During this interview it was also revealed that Henderson and Jones wrote the song but Henderson's record label (at the time this was Syco Music) said \"you can't put this out you're not relevant\". Jones determined to release the song in some format subsequently took the recording to American singer Selena Gomez who recorded a version of the song but for similar reasons, Gomez's label also rejected the song. \nAlthough Jones ended up with two versions of the song, he stated it felt right to release the version featuring Henderson's vocal as the pair wrote the song together. The version of \"This is Real\" which was released features Henderson's original vocals from the first recording of the song, prior to Gomez's version. Reflecting back on how the collaboration came about, Henderson said that she and Jones were friends as Jones' wife used to babysit her when she was younger. The duo recorded the song back in 2014.\n\"This is Real\" was released along the same time as announcements that Henderson had signed a new record deal with Major Tom Records, a collaborative partnership between UK band Rudimental and Asylum Records. Around the same time, Henderson also released her own EP (extended play), Glorious and appeared on Sigala's single \"We Got Love\". Polydor Records noted during an interview with Music Week, that they had specifically selected \"This is Real\" as one of two songs to promote ahead of the release of Jones' album.\nJones and Henderson performed \"This is Real\" a number of times together, including at Capital FM's Jingle Bell Ball on Saturday 7 December 2019. Capital FM noted that Jones brought the largest number of guests and guest vocalists in the history of the ball. The duo also performed on Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway on 7 March 2020.\nHuw Baines in writing a review for The Guardian said that \"This is Real\" and \"Play\" (with Years & Years) \"sound[ed] glorious atop crisp, thudding percussion\" were examples of Jones' successful release tactics. Baines said that these collaborations were like \"a cogent narrative in order to bounce from set piece to set piece like an action film director out for the next endorphin rush.\"\nThough not an official chart in the United States, media monitoring organisation Mediabase reported that \"This is Real\" reached number one on their US Dance Radio chart in February. In Henderson's hometown of Grimsby, England, the local news hailed \"This is Real\" as a \"remarkable\" comeback for Henderson who previously appeared on the UK charts in 2014 with singles \"Ghost\" and \"Glow\" which reached number one and number seven respectively.\nDirector 'Favourite Colour: Black' from the Park Village production company helmed an official music video themed around the concept of human meets machine. Working with Choreographer Mark Jennings, the company produced a concept whereby \"human meets machine is set up with a Jax-branded cheerleader against an artificial robotic opponent which at first feels cold and inhuman, but by the end of the film has been brought to life by the music, establishing an almost human connection between the two.\" The machine character in the video is \"the BOLT high speed cinebot - a motion control arm specially developed for use with the Phantom camera to capture movement in super slow motion.\"\nThe video made its premiere on 21 October 2019.\nDigital single (album version)\n\"This is Real\" (with Ella Henderson) \u2013 3:19\nDigital single (Acoustic)\n\"This is Real\" (acoustic) (with Ella Henderson) \u2013 2:49\n \nDigital single (Amazon Original)\n\"This is Real\" (VIP) (with Ella Henderson) \u2013 3:21\nAlbum track download/stream (from the Midnight Snacks (Part 1) EP)\n\"This is Real\" (with Ella"

The song was released as a digital download on 21 October 2019 as the second single from his debut studio album Snacks (Supersize). The song peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart.\nOn 15 August 2019, Jones spoke to Capital Breakfast about his then upcoming debut album Snacks (Supersize) (2019), confirming collaborations with Raye and Ella Henderson for the album. Jones described the latter as having an \"amazing voice\". Then in an interview on 17 August Jones spoke to The Big Top 40's Will Manning where he revealed that the Henderson collaboration was called \"This is Real.\" During this interview it was also revealed that Henderson and Jones wrote the song but Henderson's record label (at the time this was Syco Music) said \"you can't put this out you're not relevant\". Jones determined to release the song in some format subsequently took the recording to American singer Selena Gomez who recorded a version of the song but for similar reasons, Gomez's label also rejected the song. \nAlthough Jones ended up with two versions of the song, he stated it felt right to release the version featuring Henderson's vocal as the pair wrote the song together. The version of \"This is Real\" which was released features Henderson's original vocals from the first recording of the song, prior to Gomez's version. Reflecting back on how the collaboration came about, Henderson said that she and Jones were friends as Jones' wife used to babysit her when she was younger. The duo recorded the song back in 2014.\n\"This is Real\" was released along the same time as announcements that Henderson had signed a new record deal with Major Tom Records, a collaborative partnership between UK band Rudimental and Asylum Records. Around the same time, Henderson also released her own EP (extended play), Glorious and appeared on Sigala's single \"We Got Love\". Polydor Records noted during an interview with Music Week, that they had specifically selected \"This is Real\" as one of two songs to promote ahead of the release of Jones' album.\nJones and Henderson performed \"This is Real\" a number of times together, including at Capital FM's Jingle Bell Ball on Saturday 7 December 2019. Capital FM noted that Jones brought the largest number of guests and guest vocalists in the history of the ball. The duo also performed on Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway on 7 March 2020.\nHuw Baines in writing a review for The Guardian said that \"This is Real\" and \"Play\" (with Years & Years) \"sound[ed] glorious atop crisp, thudding percussion\" were examples of Jones' successful release tactics. Baines said that these collaborations were like \"a cogent narrative in order to bounce from set piece to set piece like an action film director out for the next endorphin rush.\"\nThough not an official chart in the United States, media monitoring organisation Mediabase reported that \"This is Real\" reached number one on their US Dance Radio chart in February. In Henderson's hometown of Grimsby, England, the local news hailed \"This is Real\" as a \"remarkable\" comeback for Henderson who previously appeared on the UK charts in 2014 with singles \"Ghost\" and \"Glow\" which reached number one and number seven respectively.\nDirector 'Favourite Colour: Black' from the Park Village production company helmed an official music video themed around the concept of human meets machine. Working with Choreographer Mark Jennings, the company produced a concept whereby \"human meets machine is set up with a Jax-branded cheerleader against an artificial robotic opponent which at first feels cold and inhuman, but by the end of the film has been brought to life by the music, establishing an almost human connection between the two.\" The machine character in the video is \"the BOLT high speed cinebot - a motion control arm specially developed for use with the Phantom camera to capture movement in super slow motion.\"\nThe video made its premiere on 21 October 2019.\nDigital single (album version)\n\"This is Real\" (with Ella Henderson) \u2013 3:19\nDigital single (Acoustic)\n\"This is Real\" (acoustic) (with Ella Henderson) \u2013 2:49\n \nDigital single (Amazon Original)\n\"This is Real\" (VIP) (with Ella Henderson) \u2013 3:21\nAlbum track download/stream (from the Midnight Snacks (Part 1) EP)\n\"This is Real\" (with Ella"

Perry wrote the song with Desmond Child and Andreas Carlsson, and Greg Wells produced it, who is also credited for playing all the instruments on the song. It was officially released to US radio stations on April 21, 2009. \"Waking Up in Vegas\" is a pop rock track about an underage couple getting drunk and blowing their money in Las Vegas, paying homage to the phrase \"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.\"\nThe song reached the top ten in eight countries, including the United States, where it peaked at number nine and became Perry's third top ten single. It also reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 subchart and on Hungarian radio. The music video was directed by Joseph Kahn and it features Perry and actor Joel David Moore in Vegas partying and gambling. Perry performed the track during her Hello Katy Tour and California Dreams Tour, and an acoustic snippet was sung during the Las Vegas show of Witness: The Tour. The song is a playable track in the 2015 video game Guitar Hero Live. The song is currently being used to promote Perry's upcoming concert residency at Resorts World Las Vegas in December 2021.\nAccording to A&R Chris Anokute, \"Waking Up in Vegas\" played a significant role in initiating Perry's pivotal move to Capitol Records. Having been recorded while still under contract with Columbia Records for an album that was then shelved, Anokute later heard the track on a three-song demo and tried to convince his employers at Capitol to sign Perry, claiming it was a number-one single and its singer a star talent.  In an interview with HitQuarters, one of the songwriters of the song, Andreas Carlsson, claimed that he worked together with Perry and Desmond Child to write \"Waking Up in Vegas\". Carlsson remarked that they \"really wanted to tell the story that described that moment when everybody's checking out on Vegas after they've had their fun. And Katy is the perfect artist to tell such a story \u2013 she has humour, and she knows how to deliver it.\" Carlsson also said that two of the first aspects of the song to be composed were the main guitar riff \u2013 which he already had pre-prepared \u2013 and the phrase \"put your money where your mouth is,\" which they were very keen to use and which for a time was almost used as the song's title.\nIn an interview for Pop Eater, Perry revealed the inspiration behind the track:\nWhat inspired it [was] this boy I was dating at the time. I was 21. We went to Vegas on a whim and we decided to get fake married. We took all the pictures with the minister, with the fake cake, in the fake chapel and got a fake marriage certificate. We went and bought a wedding dress and a suit at a thrift store, and scanned the pictures and the certificate to my family members, my manager at the time [and] totally freaked the s--- out of them. It was the most hilarious, stupid prank I've ever pulled. I still have the wedding dress and the certificate.\n\"Waking Up in Vegas\" was eventually picked as the album's fourth and final single, being sent to US radio stations on April 21, 2009. On the single's artwork, Perry is seen with two dice behind her, giving more emphasis to the song's lyrical content of being in Vegas. Digital extended play containing radio edit, Calvin Harris remix, Jason Nevins remixes and Manhattan Clique remixes was released on June 5, 2009. Later in June the CD single featuring radio edit version of song and Calvin Harris remix edit was released in United Kingdom and Germany.\n\"Waking Up in Vegas\" was produced by Greg Wells, who is also responsible for all instruments of the track, as well as for recording the track at the Rocket Carousel Studio, in Los Angeles, California. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of F major, and moves at a tempo of 126 beats per minute. Perry's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Musically, the song has been described as a pop rock song. Lyrically, according to Plugged In, \"Waking Up in Vegas\" talks about an underage couple get[ting] drunk and blow[ing] their money before [literally] 'waking Up in Vegas'.\" Perry added that the song is not about apologizing, \"[It's] basically a song about getting into trouble with your best friend"

It was co-written and produced by St. Louis production team The Trak Starz. It was released on April 14, 2003, by Capitol Records, Priority Records, and Disturbing tha Peace as the debut single from his debut album, Jackpot (2003). The song received positive reviews from critics, who praised the production and Chingy's addictive delivery.\n\"Right Thurr\" was kept from being number one by Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's \"Crazy in Love\" and Nelly, P. Diddy and Murphy Lee's \"Shake Ya Tailfeather\", staying at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, giving him his first of three top 5 hits on that chart. It also became a number-one hit on the Hot Rap Songs chart for four weeks and peaked at numbers two and five on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Mainstream Top 40 charts, respectively. The song reached number one in New Zealand and peaked within the top 20 in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the United Kingdom. The song was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA).\nAn accompanying music video for the song, directed by Jessy Terrero, takes place in Chingy's hometown of St. Louis. An official remix for the song was made as a bonus track on the album that featured rappers Jermaine Dupri and Trina. A music video for the remix, directed by Jeremy Rall, features all three artists dancing on an all-white backdrop.\nMatt Cibula of PopMatters liked Chingy's choice of playing a pimp-like character for the song, saying \"there\u2019s something to his voice, a certain awed respect for the absolutely amazing qualities of southern women, that puts the song over the top.\" Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic called it an \"instant party rap classic\". John Mulvey of NME gave a mixed review of the song, noticing the imitation Neptunes beat from the Trak Starz and Chingy's limitation as a rapper, but still found it to be \"utterly irresistible\" concluding that \"It's all terribly Dirty South, as you'd imagine, but Chingy's soft and compelling way with the letter 'r' is weirdly Devonian, too. Which isn't something you can say about most potty-mouthed hip-hop prodigies these days. Nice wurrk.\"\n\"Right Thurr\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of May 17, 2003, at number 97. Six weeks later, it moved ten spots from number 31 to 21 the week of June 28, 2003. It moved six spots to number 15 the week of July 5, 2003. It entered the top ten on the week of July 12, 2003, by moving six spots to number 9. It reached the top five by moving five spots to number 4 the week of July 19, 2003. It peaked at number 2 the week of August 9, 2003, through a surge of airplay but was kept from being number one by Beyonc\u00e9's \"Crazy in Love\" and Nelly, P. Diddy and Murphy Lee's \"Shake Ya Tailfeather\" for five non-consecutive weeks. It stayed on the chart for thirty-three weeks.\nDirected by Jessy Terrero, the video takes place at Beacon Ave. in Walnut Park East, St. Louis where Chingy is with his friends outside the porch of his house and is attracted by several women walking past his house. It moves to a club run by DJ Quik, where Chingy is performing on stage and partying with his friends while throwing money in the air, and at Courtesy Diner where Chingy is hanging out inside and outside of the diner. It ends with a late-night shot of the Gateway Arch intercut with fade shots of Chingy at the club. Ludacris, Murphy Lee, Kyjuan and The Trak Starz make cameo appearances in the video.\nAn uncut version of the video featured extended scenes from the club of various women in bras and thongs doing suggestive dances on the people and/or each other. It was only shown at late-night on BET: Uncut and on the enhanced CD/DVD version of the album.\nChingy made his US television debut performing \"Right Thurr\" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on July 17, 2003.\nAn official remix for the song was made as a bonus track on the album that featured rappers Jermaine Dupri and Trina. A video (found in the CD/DVD version of the album) was made for the remix that featured all three artists on an all white backdrop dancing together with people around them.

It was produced by Butch Walker, and released on January 12, 2009, as the album's third single. \"Thinking of You\" deals with a break-up in which Perry does not want to move on but has no choice, and feels nostalgic of a previous lover while in a relationship with another man.\nThe song peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the album's only single to fail to reach the Top 10 in the United States, and peaked at number 27 in the United Kingdom. There are two music videos released for the song. The first was released in 2007 and features Perry in two different rooms\u2014black and white\u2014and was directed by a friend of hers. The second was the commercial release in 2009, which is set in the 1940s and features Perry playing a woman who lost her lover, a soldier (played by Matt Dallas), in battle during World War II. Perry began playing the song during gigs as early as 2006, and performed the song on all of her concert tours: the Hello Katy Tour, the California Dreams Tour, the Prismatic World Tour and Witness: The Tour. In South America, the song was included in the international soundtrack of Brazilian soap opera India, a Love Story and became very successful.\n\"Thinking of You\" was written by Perry in 2002 and produced by Butch Walker. Amateur video of Perry performing an entirely acoustic version at the Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Los Angeles as early as 2006 is available on YouTube. The single was released on January 12, 2009, in the US, and in Australia a week later.\nAccording to digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony-ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of E major and the tempo moves at 76 beats per minute. Perry's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of G\u266f\u2083 to the higher note of C\u2085. According to Perry, the lyrics of the song are about a break-up after which she doesn't want to move on but has no choice, and is thinking about her ex-boyfriend while she is with her current lover. Perry describes her former lover as \"perfection\" and feels disgusted with herself when she kisses her current boyfriend, calling him second best in comparison.\nWriting for BBC Music, Lizzie Ennever exalted her vocal performance while commenting that the song possesses \"edge\" and \"rawness\" that, according to Ennever, are characteristic of the \"real [Perry]\". David Balls from Digital Spy described the track as a \"serious offering designed to show off her vocal and songwriting talents\", and compared it to the catalogues of Alanis Morissette and band Evanescence. Giving it three stars out of five, he wrote: \"So does she succeed? Well, certainly not for want of trying.\" In a less positive review, Nicole Frehsee from Rolling Stone dismissed the song as \"generic Dawson's Creek schlock\".\nJon Caramanica of The New York Times favored the song's production, stating that Perry works better with melody and emotion. He contrasted the song\u2014which he described as \"gently and compellingly angry\"\u2014with Perry's singles of sexual themes, and concluded that \"feeling deeply is shocking enough\". For Contactmusic.com, Kelda Manley called the song \"high quality\" whereas NME reviewer Alex Miller jokingly regarded it as having \"all the emotional subtlety of a flamethrower\". A writer for The Boston Globe found similarities to Alanis Morissette's musicality in the track, such as her \"sour melodicism\" and vocals. Reviewing the single for Billboard, editor CT praised Perry for her \"distinct vocal inflection\". Another writer of Capital described it as \"cracking\" and \"single material\".\nIn the United States, \"Thinking of You\" attained moderate success. The song debuted on the US Billboard component chart Bubbling Under Hot 100 at number 5. Three weeks later, it entered the primary Hot 100 chart at number 79; having climbed to number 50 in the following week. It rose fifteen spots one week after, giving the track the title of \"Greatest Digital Gainer\" for that chart issue. The following week, it reached a peak of number 29, where it stayed for more two weeks. By the seventh week spent on the chart, the song moved to number 31; from there on, it started plummeting down the chart. Following a chart progression of 34\u2013 44\u2013 51\u2013 55\u2013 67\u2013 68\u2013 84, it left the chart at number 91 on the May 9 chart issue. \"Thinking of You\" has sold 1.1 million copies in the United States as of January 2015.\nInternationally, commercial outcomes for"

Perry wrote the song with Desmond Child and Andreas Carlsson, and Greg Wells produced it, who is also credited for playing all the instruments on the song. It was officially released to US radio stations on April 21, 2009. \"Waking Up in Vegas\" is a pop rock track about an underage couple getting drunk and blowing their money in Las Vegas, paying homage to the phrase \"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.\"\nThe song reached the top ten in eight countries, including the United States, where it peaked at number nine and became Perry's third top ten single. It also reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 subchart and on Hungarian radio. The music video was directed by Joseph Kahn and it features Perry and actor Joel David Moore in Vegas partying and gambling. Perry performed the track during her Hello Katy Tour and California Dreams Tour, and an acoustic snippet was sung during the Las Vegas show of Witness: The Tour. The song is a playable track in the 2015 video game Guitar Hero Live. The song is currently being used to promote Perry's upcoming concert residency at Resorts World Las Vegas in December 2021.\nAccording to A&R Chris Anokute, \"Waking Up in Vegas\" played a significant role in initiating Perry's pivotal move to Capitol Records. Having been recorded while still under contract with Columbia Records for an album that was then shelved, Anokute later heard the track on a three-song demo and tried to convince his employers at Capitol to sign Perry, claiming it was a number-one single and its singer a star talent.  In an interview with HitQuarters, one of the songwriters of the song, Andreas Carlsson, claimed that he worked together with Perry and Desmond Child to write \"Waking Up in Vegas\". Carlsson remarked that they \"really wanted to tell the story that described that moment when everybody's checking out on Vegas after they've had their fun. And Katy is the perfect artist to tell such a story \u2013 she has humour, and she knows how to deliver it.\" Carlsson also said that two of the first aspects of the song to be composed were the main guitar riff \u2013 which he already had pre-prepared \u2013 and the phrase \"put your money where your mouth is,\" which they were very keen to use and which for a time was almost used as the song's title.\nIn an interview for Pop Eater, Perry revealed the inspiration behind the track:\nWhat inspired it [was] this boy I was dating at the time. I was 21. We went to Vegas on a whim and we decided to get fake married. We took all the pictures with the minister, with the fake cake, in the fake chapel and got a fake marriage certificate. We went and bought a wedding dress and a suit at a thrift store, and scanned the pictures and the certificate to my family members, my manager at the time [and] totally freaked the s--- out of them. It was the most hilarious, stupid prank I've ever pulled. I still have the wedding dress and the certificate.\n\"Waking Up in Vegas\" was eventually picked as the album's fourth and final single, being sent to US radio stations on April 21, 2009. On the single's artwork, Perry is seen with two dice behind her, giving more emphasis to the song's lyrical content of being in Vegas. Digital extended play containing radio edit, Calvin Harris remix, Jason Nevins remixes and Manhattan Clique remixes was released on June 5, 2009. Later in June the CD single featuring radio edit version of song and Calvin Harris remix edit was released in United Kingdom and Germany.\n\"Waking Up in Vegas\" was produced by Greg Wells, who is also responsible for all instruments of the track, as well as for recording the track at the Rocket Carousel Studio, in Los Angeles, California. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of F major, and moves at a tempo of 126 beats per minute. Perry's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Musically, the song has been described as a pop rock song. Lyrically, according to Plugged In, \"Waking Up in Vegas\" talks about an underage couple get[ting] drunk and blow[ing] their money before [literally] 'waking Up in Vegas'.\" Perry added that the song is not about apologizing, \"[It's] basically a song about getting into trouble with your best friend"

Recorded for their debut studio album, Fallen (2003), Wind-up Records released it as the album's second single on September 9, 2003. The song was written by Evanescence members Amy Lee, David Hodges and Ben Moody while its production was handled by Dave Fortman. The song contains rock and heavy metal elements and its instrumentation consists of drums and guitars built around Lee's soprano vocals. Lyrically, \"Going Under\" was written about an emotionally difficult past relationship. It received mostly positive reviews from music critics, most of whom praised its anthemic chorus and Lee's vocal performance. \"Going Under\" peaked at number five on the US Billboard Alternative Songs chart, charted in the top ten in Brazil, Italy, New Zealand and the UK and the top forty in various other European countries and Australia. It obtained a platinum certification in the latter country by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).\nA music video for the song was directed by Philipp St\u00f6lzl and it was filmed in May 2003 in Berlin. It features the band performing the song live, while spectators from the audience turn into zombies and water in which lead singer Lee drowns, illustrating the song's lyrics of sinking. The singer designed both of the dresses she wears in the video. Evanescence performed the song live during the set list of their concert tours in support of Fallen (2003-2004) and The Open Door (2006-2007) as well as the Evanescence Tour (2011-2012) in support of their self-titled third studio album. They also performed it during several of their televised appearances, such as the 2003 Teen Choice Awards, the 2003 American Music Awards and the Jimmy Kimmel Live! show in 2011.\n\"Going Under\" was written by Amy Lee, David Hodges and Ben Moody, while its production was handled by Dave Fortman. It was the last song included on Fallen (2003) although a demo version with a different arrangement was recorded before the album's release. An acoustic version was recorded shortly after the release of Fallen, along with similar versions for several other songs from the album. According to Lee, \"Going Under\" lyrically talks about recovering from an abusive relationship. In an interview with MTV News, she further elaborated the meaning and the inspiration behind the song, \"The lyrics are about coming out of a bad relationship, and when you're at the end of your rope, when you're at the point where you realize something has to change, that you can't go on living in the situation that you're in. It's cool. It's a very strong song.\" \"Going Under\" was initially supposed to serve as the first single from Fallen but its release was scrapped in favor of \"Bring Me to Life\". It was released as the second single from Fallen on September 9, 2003. A CD maxi single contains the album version of the song, a live version recorded at WNOR in Norfolk, Virginia, an acoustic radio version and an acoustic version of Nirvana's \"Heart-Shaped Box,\" recorded at WXDX-FM in Pittsburgh.  The music video for the song is also included on the CD single.\nAccording to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing on the website Musicnotes.com, \"Going Under\" is set in common time and performed in slow and free tempo of 84 beats per minute.  It is written in the key of B minor and Lee's vocal range for the song runs from the low musical note of E\u2083 to the high musical note of D\u266f5. Initially, her vocals in the song start as whispers and gradually turn into louder screams as the song progresses. Associated with the nu metal genre, the song's instrumentation is provided by guitars, a drum machine and piano. Lyrically, the song talks about a hard relationship and includes an empowering message. A writer for The Boston Globe said that the song is \"a mix of Lee's ethereal soprano, piano interludes, and layers of serrated guitar crunch that conjure visions of Sarah McLachlan fronting Godsmack\". Mikel Toombs of Seattle Post-Intelligencer found a Wagnerian arrangement and metal and classic rock influences in the song. \"Going Under\" was also described as a \"goth-meets pop\" song by Michael D. Clark of the Houston Chronicle. Tim Sendra of AllMusic said that the \"tinkling pianos and hip-hop-inspired backing vocals, [are] making the song perfect for those who find the male"

It was released by Wind-up Records on December 8, 2003, as the third single from the album. An alternative version appears on the band's fourth studio album Synthesis (2017). The song was written by guitarist Ben Moody, lead singer Amy Lee and keyboardist David Hodges, and it was produced by Moody and Dave Fortman. Various versions of \"My Immortal\" were recorded; one of them was included on the demo album Origin (2000) and another on the EP release Mystary (2003). The version originally appearing on Origin was later included on Fallen, featuring piano with backing strings. The version of the song released as a single was dubbed the \"band version\" because of the complete band's performance of the bridge and final chorus of the song.\n\"My Immortal\" is a piano power ballad with a slow tempo. Lyrically, it talks about \"a spirit staying with you after its death and haunting you until you actually wish that the spirit were gone because it won't leave you alone.\" Critical reception towards the song was positive, with critics complimenting its piano melody. In 2005, it received a nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 47th Grammy Awards. The song was also commercially successful, peaking within the top ten in more than ten countries. It charted at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, Greece and Portugal, as well as on the Billboard Adult Pop Songs chart. The single was certified gold in the United States and platinum in Australia.\nAn accompanying music video directed by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Gothic Quarter, Barcelona, on October 10, 2003. The video shows Lee sitting and singing on various locations but never touching the ground. Shots of Moody are also shown but he is never together with his band or Lee. The video was nominated in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was performed by the band during their three concert tours: the Fallen Tour (2003), The Open Door Tour (2007) and the Evanescence Tour (2011\u201312). It was also performed live during some of their television appearances and award ceremonies such as the Billboard Music Awards.\nThe song was written by Ben Moody and Amy Lee and produced by Moody and Dave Fortman; it was the fourth song to be written for Evanescence. Amy Lee's vocals and the piano parts of the song were recorded in NRG Recording Studios, California. The drums, bass and electric guitars were recorded at The Steakhouse Studio in North Hollywood. \"My Immortal\" was mixed by Dave Fortman at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood while it was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in New York City. The orchestral parts in the song were arranged by the composer Graeme Revell.\nThe earliest known demo of \"My Immortal\" was recorded in 1997, which solely featured Lee's vocals accompanied by a piano and slightly different lyrics. The song was intended to be included on the band's self-titled EP but was cut before it was released. In 2000, the song was re-recorded for the band's demo album, Origin, which contains a rearranged piano melody and lyrics, including the bridge added by Lee. It was again recorded for the band's debut full-length debut studio album, Fallen, where the vocals of the demo version were accompanied by slightly different instrumentation. It is also featured on the band's 2003 EP, Mystary, which is much more similar to the band version. Wind-up Records preferred the Origin version, which is why the exact vocals recorded from 2000 are again included in the song's album version. The version that was recorded and released as a single is moderately alternative to that of the album version and is often referred to as the \"band version\" because of the additional band performing the bridge and final chorus of the song. The later pressings of Fallen contain the single version (or \"band version\") of \"My Immortal\" as a hidden track. Lee expressed some dissatisfaction with the early versions of the song saying, \"It's not even a real piano. And the sound quality is bad because we had to break into the studio to record it late at night when no one was around because we couldn't afford a real session.\"\n\"My Immortal\" is a piano and power ballad written in the key of A major. It was described as a \"goth-meets-pop\" song. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing on the"

The double A-side reached number one in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. The video for \"Tragedy\", originally a hit written and performed by the Bee Gees, contained the dance step of putting both hands parallel to the sides of the head in time with the word 'Tragedy', which became a trademark of the group.\nThe single hit the number one spot in the UK Singles Chart after eight weeks on that chart. \"Heartbeat\" / \"Tragedy\" spent a total of 30 weeks in the chart, and sold more copies than all three previous Steps singles combined, with 1.21 million copies sold in the UK. \"Heartbeat\" features Claire and Faye singing the first two verses. Lisa performs the middle eight, followed by Claire. The rest of the group join in for the choruses. Tragedy features again Faye and Claire singing the verses, with the rest of Steps joining in for the choruses. While promoting the 2012 Hit Factory Live event, Pete Waterman revealed that the song had sat in a drawer for years before he gave it to the band to record.\n\nScottish newspaper Aberdeen Evening Express stated that Steps \"did such a sparkling remake\" of the song, noting that it \"gets [Steptacular] off to a discotastic start\". AllMusic editor Jon O'Brien described it as a \"triumphant cover\". Lucas Villa from AXS wrote that Claire, Faye and Lisa's \"powerful performances (coupled with that iconic hands dance step) made \"Tragedy\" an undeniable dance floor anthem.\" A reviewer from Daily Record commented, \"Once again, Steps have come up with a catchy tune and the reworking of Tragedy has clubbers mimicking the band's dance techniques.\"\nThe music videos for \"Heartbeat\" and \"Tragedy\" were directed by David Amphlett. \"Heartbeat\" is set in snowy surroundings. It begins with Steps riding a sleigh while an evil Ice Queen has her sights set on Ian \"H\" Watkins; she is watching an image on the tiny pond in her throne room. The group are staying in a lodge, and H goes out back to fetch some wood for the fire. The Ice Queen decides that this is the time to strike, and she sends her three dwarf guards to kidnap H. They jump H, and the Ice Queen casts a spell, knocking him out. By the time H wakes up, he is in the back of their sleigh. The rest of the group come out and find H is missing, finding only a little sword carried by one of the guards. On skis and snowmobiles, they set off to rescue H. Along the way to the Ice Queen's castle, they stop at a barn, finding absolutely nothing. Arriving at the castle, they break into the throne room where H is tied up in the middle of the frozen pond. Faye Tozer, Lee Latchford-Evans and Claire Richards easily take care of the guards (while H is able to free himself), and Lisa Scott-Lee defeats the Ice Queen with a karate kick to the chin. The group then return to the lodge for a Christmas party.\nThe video for \"Tragedy\" starts with a Doraemon-shaped alarm clock ringing and sees Faye, Claire, and Lisa getting married. The lads, Lee and H, sabotage all three weddings before they all go to a disco. The church and disco scenes were filmed in All Saints' Church, Harrow Weald, London and the adjoining Blackwell Hall, respectively. The external location shots of the boys leaving their house and driving were filmed in Blackheath, South London. The group's actual families all took part in the video, with the girls' fathers walking them down the aisle, and record producer Pete Waterman appears as the wedding DJ.\nUK and Australian CD single\n\"Heartbeat\" \u2013 4:24\n\"Tragedy\" \u2013 4:31\n\"Heartbeat\" (instrumental) \u2013 4:24\nUK cassette single and European CD single\n\"Heartbeat\" \u2013 4:24\n\"Tragedy\" \u2013 4:31\nUS CD and cassette single\n\"Tragedy\" (LP version) \u2013 4:30\n\"Stay with Me\" \u2013 4:04\n\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes of Step One.\nRecording\nRecorded at PWL Studios, Manchester in 1998\nMixed at PWL Studios, Manchester\nMastered at Transfermation Studios, London\nVocals\nLead vocals\u00a0\u2013 Claire Richards, Faye Tozer, Lisa Scott-Lee, Ian \"H\" Watkins\nBackground vocals\u00a0\u2013 Lee Latchford-Evans\nPersonnel\nSongwriting\u00a0\u2013 Jackie James\nProduction\u00a0\u2013 Karl Twigg, Mark Topham, Pete Waterman\nMixing\u00a0\u2013 Pete Waterman, Dan Frampton\nEngineer\u00a0\u2013 Chris McDonnell\nDrums\u00a0\u2013 Chris McDonnell\nKeyboards\u00a0\u2013 Karl Twigg, Mark Topham\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes of"

Hutton. \"The Way That I Love You\" is a song recorded by American singer Ashanti from her fourth studio album, The Declaration (2008). It was released as the album's lead single on February 26, 2008, through Universal and The Inc. Ashanti wrote and produced the song with L.T. Hutton. Backed by piano, guitar, and horns, \"The Way That I Love You\" is a midtempo R&B ballad whose lyrics tell of betrayal. \nCritical response was primarily positive; some reviewers said it was a highlight from The Declaration while others felt it was inferior to music released by Beyonc\u00e9 and Mary J. Blige. Commercially, the song peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and appeared on the publication's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Adult R&B Songs component charts. Ashanti performed \"The Way That I Love You\" at Sessions@AOL and on tour.\nKevin Bray directed the music video which tells the story of Ashanti and her boyfriend\u2014he cheats on her, she discovers it, and she murders him. The story for the video was inspired by the true crime TV shows Snapped and Forensic Files. The video's emphasis on violence attracted critical attention. As part of the song's promotion, Ashanti launched a website that allowed users to create and send a personalized news report and death threat to a contact. The campaign was received negatively and incited a protest in Los Angeles. The website was ultimately taken down.\nFor her fourth studio album The Declaration (2008), Ashanti collaborated with songwriters and producers outside of her record label Murder Inc. Her previous album Concrete Rose (2004) had been overshadowed by negative news regarding the label, including a feud with G-Unit and an FBI investigation. L.T. Hutton produced a majority of The Declaration, instead of Ashanti's longtime producer Irv Gotti. Ashanti said that she had more artistic freedom with the album. Hutton and Ashanti wrote and produced \"The Way That I Love\". Ashanti said that she \"just started jotting down words, and it just kind of poured out\" upon hearing the opening instrumental. She produced the lead and background vocals, and Hutton programmed the song and played the instruments. The final version was mixed at Brandons Way Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. \n\"Switch\", which featured Nelly, and \"Hey Baby (After the Club)\" were both announced as the album's lead single in 2007. They were replaced by \"The Way That I Love You\",  which was released to urban radio on February 26, 2008, and rhythmic radio on April 1, 2008. It was the number one most-added song on urban radio in the week of its release. The single was included on a July 2008 Cartier charity playlist created to support the Boys & Girls Clubs of America organization.\n\"The Way That I Love You\" is a midtempo R&B ballad that lasts four minutes and thirty seconds. It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a \"moderate hip-hop\" tempo. The instrumentation is provided by a piano, a guitar, and horns; Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the single is \"driven by a distinct descending piano arpeggio and horn arrangement\". \nAshanti's vocal range spans from the low note of D\u2084 to the high note of E\u2085. AllMusic's Andy Kellman compared her vocals to her 2003 single \"Rain on Me\" because of their similar \"melodramatic flourishes\" but said the lyrics of \"The Way That I Love You\" were \"much more vengeful in nature than depressive.\" Ashanti felt both men and women would relate to the single's theme of betrayal.\n\"The Way That I Love You\" was praised by critics who identified it as a highlight of The Declaration. The New York Daily News' Jim Farber felt Ashanti's collaboration with Hutton was her best work, and described \"The Way That I Love You\" as a \"strut of a song.\" Noah Berlatsky of the Chicago Reader noted the song's piano loop as one of the few standouts from the album. A Dayton Daily News reviewer summed up the single as \"cliche but effective.\" \nOn the other hand, some commentators negatively compared \"The Way That I Love You\" to music released by other singers. Despite praising Ashanti's performance as emotional, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly found the single to be inferior to those by Beyonc\u00e9 and Mary J. Blige. Vibe's Shanel Odum dismissed the song as \"barely set[ting] off a smoke detector, let alone ring[ing] any alarms\", in a reference to Beyonc\u00e9's 2006 single \"Ring the Alarm\".\nCommercially, \"The Way That I Love You\" peaked at"

It was released as the first single from the album on 18 August 2003 in the United States and on 1 September 2003 in Australia.\nThe song peaked at number 20 in Australia and additionally reached the top 20 in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it reached number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it their first top-40 hit and their highest charting single; it also peaked at number three on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and number seven on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The single has sold 1.3 million copies in the United States since 2012.\nIn January 2018, as part of Triple M's \"Ozzest 100\", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, \"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\" was ranked number 38.\nWritten by Nic Cester and Cameron Muncey, the song is often cited for similarities to Iggy Pop's \"Lust for Life\" (particularly its drum pattern and near-identical guitar riff); and the 1999 song \"Screwdriver\" from the White Stripes. The band, however, argues that \"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\" has more in common with 1960s Motown songs, namely \"I'm Ready for Love\" by Martha and the Vandellas and \"You Can't Hurry Love\" by the Supremes.\nChris Cester responded to media commentary regarding the similarities, stating in a Jared Story interview that the beat was taken from Motown, referring to a meeting between Pop and himself:\nIt's funny because I asked him point blank about that. He said I was crazy. He said that when he and David Bowie were writing \"Lust for Life\", they were ripping off Motown's beat. It's funny that he said that to me because we also thought we were ripping off Motown more than \"Lust for Life\". To be honest with you that kind of annoyed me a lot, because I always thought it was really lazy. People just go well Lust for Life is more well-known so that's what they go for, but if you listen to a song like \"You Can't Hurry Love\" (The Supremes) I think you'll find its closer to \"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\" than \"Lust for Life\" ever was. And that's what Iggy said as well.\nThe music video is shot in black and white, and shows Jet performing in a blank studio. As they play, black ink starts pouring out of their equipment and forms a landscape resembling the cover art on their album Get Born, the Beatles album Revolver and silhouettes of dancing girls. The video was shot at Vinopolis, London.

It was originally released in Australia on 27 May 1996 as the lead single from their eponymous debut album, Savage Garden. The single reached number one in Canada for two weeks and peaked at number four in Australia and on the US Billboard Hot 100. The single also peaked at number nine in Iceland and at 11 on the UK Singles Chart. In November 1998, the single was re-released in the United Kingdom following the success of \"Truly Madly Deeply\" and \"To the Moon and Back\". This release peaked at number 12.\nAt the APRA Music Awards of 1998 it won Most Performed Australian Work Overseas. In January 2018, as part of Triple M's \"Ozzest 100\", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, the album version of the song was ranked number 87.\nThe song's lyrics refer to the attraction exerted by a person possessing strong sex appeal. They fascinate the singer and arouse his curiosity, even though he is not sure whether he needs them at all. Singer Darren Hayes described it as a song about \"being in love with a male energy\", when asked if the song had a coded gay message. The fast-paced, almost rapped vocal style verses is similar to the verses featured in Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me) by Reunion.\nIn an interview with Apple Music about their debut album, Darren Hayes also said:\n\"I have such a soft spot for this song and it just keeps coming back. It's based on a dream that I had where I fell in love with a boy. And when I woke up, I missed him. I didn't know how I would ever feel that feeling again. I had this almost beautiful melancholy, romantic grief. I remembered everything about this boy who I'd never met. The smell, the kiss, the feeling, the butterflies in my tummy, all that stuff. And so I spent about a week mourning that feeling. I used to think, 'Maybe if I go to sleep, I'll see him again.'\"\nLarry Flick from Billboard noted that the song \"has a jittery synth-pop beat reminiscent of such '80s-era Brit-pop heroes as Duran Duran.\" He added, \"Partners Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones are quite the harmonious pair, and they are photogenic enough to ensure instant teen-idol status. Top 40 programmers should waste no time in slammin' this one on the air.\"\nTwo music videos were released for the song. Both videos present Darren Hayes with long black hair.\nThe first video is a low-budget version released in 1996 for Australian markets. It showed the band performing in a room full of disco lights and Darren Hayes singing on the back of a moving vehicle.\nThe second video is a higher-budget version directed by Nigel Dick and premiered in 1997 for international markets in conjunction with the single's international release. It features the band in a stylised futuristic warehouse and recording studio.

It was originally released in Australia on 27 May 1996 as the lead single from their eponymous debut album, Savage Garden. The single reached number one in Canada for two weeks and peaked at number four in Australia and on the US Billboard Hot 100. The single also peaked at number nine in Iceland and at 11 on the UK Singles Chart. In November 1998, the single was re-released in the United Kingdom following the success of \"Truly Madly Deeply\" and \"To the Moon and Back\". This release peaked at number 12.\nAt the APRA Music Awards of 1998 it won Most Performed Australian Work Overseas. In January 2018, as part of Triple M's \"Ozzest 100\", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, the album version of the song was ranked number 87.\nThe song's lyrics refer to the attraction exerted by a person possessing strong sex appeal. They fascinate the singer and arouse his curiosity, even though he is not sure whether he needs them at all. Singer Darren Hayes described it as a song about \"being in love with a male energy\", when asked if the song had a coded gay message. The fast-paced, almost rapped vocal style verses is similar to the verses featured in Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me) by Reunion.\nIn an interview with Apple Music about their debut album, Darren Hayes also said:\n\"I have such a soft spot for this song and it just keeps coming back. It's based on a dream that I had where I fell in love with a boy. And when I woke up, I missed him. I didn't know how I would ever feel that feeling again. I had this almost beautiful melancholy, romantic grief. I remembered everything about this boy who I'd never met. The smell, the kiss, the feeling, the butterflies in my tummy, all that stuff. And so I spent about a week mourning that feeling. I used to think, 'Maybe if I go to sleep, I'll see him again.'\"\nLarry Flick from Billboard noted that the song \"has a jittery synth-pop beat reminiscent of such '80s-era Brit-pop heroes as Duran Duran.\" He added, \"Partners Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones are quite the harmonious pair, and they are photogenic enough to ensure instant teen-idol status. Top 40 programmers should waste no time in slammin' this one on the air.\"\nTwo music videos were released for the song. Both videos present Darren Hayes with long black hair.\nThe first video is a low-budget version released in 1996 for Australian markets. It showed the band performing in a room full of disco lights and Darren Hayes singing on the back of a moving vehicle.\nThe second video is a higher-budget version directed by Nigel Dick and premiered in 1997 for international markets in conjunction with the single's international release. It features the band in a stylised futuristic warehouse and recording studio. The international version was featured on the band's compilation Truly Madly Completely: The Best of Savage Garden (2005), while the Australian version was not available until the release of the compilation The Singles (2015).\n\nStandard\n\"I Want You\" \u2013 3:53\n\"Fire Inside the Man\" \u2013 4:11\nLimited edition\n\"I Want You\" (original radio version) \u2013 3:54\n\"I Want You\" (Flu Club Mix) \u2013 6:22\n\"I Want You\" (Pee Wee Club Mix) \u2013 6:30\n\"I Want You\" (Flu Radio Edit) \u2013 3:44\n\"I Want You\" (Flu Midnight Mix) \u2013 6:24\nCD (1997)\n\"I Want You\" (album version)\n\"I Want You\" (Xenomania Funky Mix)\n\"I Want You\" (Xenomania 12\" Club Mix)\n\"I Want You\" (Sharp Miami Mix)\nCassette (1997)\n\"I Want You\" (album version)\n\"Promises\"\nCD1 (1998)\n\"I Want You '98\" (Bascombe Mix)\n\"I Want You '98\" (Sash!

Written by Mitch Allan, Audra Mae, Kara DioGuardi, and Jason Evigan, the song is an uptempo synth-pop track produced by Greg Kurstin. Lyrically, it sings of meeting a person who restores someone's faith in love. Inspired by 1980s synthpop music, \"Heartbeat Song\" was released by RCA Records as the album's lead single on January 12, 2015.\n\"Heartbeat Song\" was released to a positive response from music critics, who complimented the song's production and praised Clarkson's decision to return to mainstream pop music. Other critics, however, noted the strong resemblance the song's melody bore to that of Jimmy Eat World's single \"The Middle\" (2001), which later allowed the band to be credited as additional songwriters. Commercially, the single debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 37 and has peaked at number 21, marking Clarkson's sixteenth top 40 hit on the chart. It also became her fifth song to top the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart and marked as her highest debut among her twenty career entries on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart. Internationally, it became a top ten hit single in Austria, Belgium, Poland, Slovenia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom while also becoming a top 20 hit in the national charts of the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Slovakia and Sweden.\nFilmed by Marc Klasfeld, its accompanying music video features a scenes of various downtrodden people and their process of finding love again. Clarkson premiered \"Heartbeat Song\" in a live televised performance on The Graham Norton Show in February 2015 and has performed it on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and the fourteenth season of American Idol. The song was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards.\nShortly after the release of her first Christmas album, Wrapped in Red (2013), Clarkson, despite her pregnancy, began to record material for her seventh studio album, with a target release date in 2014. One of these tracks, \"Heartbeat Song\", is an uptempo synthpop track produced by Greg Kurstin. Lyrically, the song sings of meeting a person who restores someone's faith in love. Sonically, USA Today's Brian Mansfeld remarked that the record serves as sonic defibrillator, starting with a jolt of melody, its rhythms shifting a couple times before finally settling into its steady pulse; while Idolator's Bradley Stern described its production as Top 40 radio-friendly and remarked that the track sees Clarkson's pulse raising while falling in love above kicky drums, guitars and hints of synths.\n\"Heartbeat Song\" was written by Mitch Allan, Audra Mae, Kara DioGuardi, and Jason Evigan in a two-day session writing camp. In an interview on Entertainment Tonight, Mae revealed that DioGuardi came up with the main idea and used it as the song's chorus, with everybody else contributing in. After pitching the song to different artists, including Demi Lovato, she later found out during the Christmas season that Clarkson had recorded it and planned to release the song as the album's lead single.\nMusically, the song is written in the key of G-flat major with a fast tempo of 149 beats per minute.  It follows the chord progression G\u266d\u2013B\u266dm7\u2013E\u266dm\u2013C\u266d, and Clarkson's vocals span from G\u266d\u2083 to E\u266d\u2085.\nIn January 2015, Clarkson revealed a set of clues for the single, posting the words \"Proof of life and Dr. Dre #TheNextEpisode (sic)\". On January 7, 2015, she announced January 12, 2015 as its release date as a digital download by RCA Records, followed by a release to Mainstream Top 40 radio stations in the United States on January 13, 2015. A CD single was also issued by RCA's parent company Sony Music Entertainment on March 6, 2015.\n\"Heartbeat Song\" garnered positive reviews from music critics, with Clarkson's return to mainstream pop music lauded, along with her vocals. Billboard's associate editor Jason Lipshutz gave the song 4/5 stars, writing the song's production and vocals sounded invigorated. Reviewing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dylan gave the song a three-and-a-half star rating, describing it as a \"warm, fuzzy snuggle-fest.\" In his midweek review for"

It was released as the third song and second official single from the album following \"Chun-Li\" and \"Barbie Tingz\" on June 14, 2018, by Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records. The song was produced by Ben Billions, Beats Bailey, Supa Dups, and Messy; and features guest vocals by American singer Ariana Grande. It marks the fourth collaboration between the two. Commercially, the song peaked at number 42 on the US Billboard Hot 100, as well as reached the top 20 in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom.\nThe two artists collaborated on \"Bang Bang\" and \"Get On Your Knees\" in 2014. Ariana Grande released \"Side to Side\" featuring Nicki Minaj as the third single of her studio album Dangerous Woman (2016). It peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming her first top-five single from the album in the chart. In May 2018, Grande revealed via Twitter that Minaj called her in the morning and recorded what would be their next musical collaboration. On June 4, Grande replied to a follower on the same social network suggesting that there would be more than one collaboration between her and Minaj to be released through 2018, the other one being \"The Light Is Coming\". On June 11, Minaj officially announced \"Bed\" as the second single from her upcoming fourth studio album Queen (2018). It was released on June 14 for digital download, along with the album pre-order. The single has an Instagram-influenced faded cover art, that features Minaj and Grande posing in a pool.\n\"Bed\" was written by Minaj with LunchMoney Lewis, Mescon David Asher, Supa Dups, Brett Bailey, and Ben Diehl, while its production was done by the latter three alongside Messy. The track is three minutes and nine seconds long. It is a downtempo-inspired pop ballad. It employs a minimalist, tropical-infused instrumental, that was noted to be similar to Troye Sivan's \"Dance to This\" (2018). According to Spin, the song is about escaping to be intimate with a lover, with a third verse about oral sex. It references Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III album (2008) and singer Zayn Malik, with whom she later collaborated, on \"No Candle No Light\".\nJoshua Copperman of Spin called the song \"charming\", \"raunchy\", and \"forceful\", and described the instrumental as \"cloudy but decidedly pretty\". He found it nearly identical to Troye Sivan's \"Dance to This\", which is \"danceable\" in opposite to \"Bed\" which \"buries its groove in pure atmosphere\". Mitch Findlay of HotNewHipHop said the song is \"a breezy addition to Queen, an obligatory radio effort, tailor made for summer play.\" He adds that the track \"serves as intimate companion piece to \"Rich Sex\", and will no doubt appeal to a different set of ears.\" Mackenzie Cummings-Grady of Billboard finds that the \"bouncy bop\" nature of the song shows that \"the album, like Minaj's previous efforts, will be a combination of club-ready pop and hardcore hip hop.\"\n\"Bed\" debuted at number 43 on the US Billboard Hot 100 after a full week of tracking, with 19,000 downloads sold and 12 million streams. The song became Minaj's 91st entry on the chart, extending her record for most Hot 100 visits among women and tying James Brown for the seventh-best sum overall. It fell 24 positions to number 67 in its second week. In its fourth week, it rose to number 48, and later reached a peak of number 42 after her album Queen was released.\nOutside the United States, \"Bed\" also reached the top 20 in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nOn June 14, 2018, Minaj and Grande shared a 15-second video teaser for \"Bed\" via their Twitter accounts. It shows the two artists in a pool, lounging around in a foam bath. On June 19, Minaj posted another one-minute preview of the music video on YouTube. On July 4, she revealed via Instagram that the video will premiere two days later. On July 5, she shared a quick behind-the-scenes look at the video on her social media. It shows her rolling around on a beach dressed up as a mermaid with a green wig. The full music video premiered on Minaj's official YouTube and Vevo accounts on July 6, 2018.

The song contains additional vocals from Young Jeezy and Connie Mitchell. It was produced by West with DJ Toomp and West was responsible for 60 percent of the production, while the latter of the two contributed 40 percent. The song originated from Young Jeezy's \"I Got Money\", after West made changes to the track. On May 15, 2007, the song premiered via Hot 97 and was released by Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam that same day as the lead single from the album. A hip hop track, it was described by West as a theme song for the people. The lyrics see West reflecting on his fame while he expresses different types of feelings.\n\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" received universal acclaim from music critics, who mostly appreciated the lyrical content. Others praised the production, while some critics highlighted the song's inclusion on Graduation. It was listed amongst the best tracks of 2007 by several publications, including Consequence of Sound and Pitchfork. The song received a nomination for Best Rap Song at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, ultimately losing to \"Good Life\". The former reached number 41 on the US Billboard Hot 100, alongside peaking at number 20 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and was certified triple platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It has also been certified gold and silver in Australia and the United Kingdom by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI), respectively.\nAn accompanying music video was released on May 25, 2007. It sees West walking around El Mirage Lake unaccompanied, while his silhouette follows him. The video received positive reviews from critics, often being complemented for its camera work. The song's alternate music video was released on July 25, 2007, which features Zach Galifianakis and Will Oldham lip-syncing \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" at Galifianakis' farm. West performed the song live throughout 2007 and 2008, including at a Live Earth concert in the former year. He later performed it at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Glastonbury Festival in 2011 and 2015, respectively.\n\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" was used in the film The Hangover (2009), marking the first of three times that West's music was featured in the films from the series of the same name. In 2013, West named it his favourite song out of his entire discography. Francis and the Lights covered the song in 2009, and an acoustic cover version was later performed by Taking Back Sunday in 2011. The song's Young Jeezy-featuring remix was released in July 2007, which contains a verse from him.\nFollowing on from meeting West when working on rapper T.I.'s second studio album Trap Muzik (2003), record producer DJ Toomp went to New York and joined West in the studio for the creation of Graduation. West showed a high amount of respect for him and was using an Ensoniq ASR-10 keyboard in the studio, which DJ Toomp said \"is the same keyboard I've been using since day one.\" Speaking of the two of them collaborating for the album, he opined that \"it definitely felt like a team atmosphere\" and also \"felt like, 'we.'\" DJ Toomp admitted that he \"would say that sixty percent of 'Can't Tell Me Nothing' was Ye, and forty me,\" while he called West \"a mastermind.\" In an interview with Revolt, DJ Toomp explained that his 40 percent of the song's production was the beat and bassline, while the 60 percent contributed by West consisted of the strings and the \"oh-oh-ah-oh-ah-oh\" backing vocals. He revealed that the song was originally supposed to be a remix of West's Def Jam labelmate Young Jeezy's song \"I Got Money\", since West loved \"the whole cadence of how that beat was flowing\" and \"wanted the song to be a remix featuring him.\" However, Young Jeezy ultimately \"wasn't really feeling it\" according to DJ Toomp, which led to the song being passed on to West.\nYoung Jeezy also offered an explanation of how \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" came from \"I Got Money\" during an interview with HipHopDX, saying that it was supposed to be a collaboration between him and T.I. for the former's third studio album The Recession (2008). The song was recalled as being sent to West by Young Jeezy and he"

Vocals are provided by Trinidadian-born American rapper and singer Nicki Minaj, whose second studio album Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded features the song as a bonus song on its deluxe version. It was written by Ester Dean, David Guetta and Giorgio Tuinfort, with a rap written by Minaj, and is lyrically about addiction.\nThe song has garnered mixed to favorable responses from music critics, who complimented Minaj's appearance on the track, while also dismissing the Auto-Tune used on Minaj's vocals. It has been chosen as the fifth official single from Nothing but the Beat. It impacted U.S. Top 40/Mainstream and Rhythmic radio on 13 December 2011. A remixes EP was released in January 2012 internationally and in February 2012 in the US and Canada. The song also marks Guetta's best-peaking single in the United States, tied with \"Without You\" which also peaked at 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was briefly used to promote WWE WrestleMania XXVIII. As of December 2014, the song has sold 2.6 million copies in the United States.\n\"Turn Me On\" was written by Ester Dean, David Guetta, and Giorgio Tuinfort. An additional rap was written by Nicki Minaj for the song. On an interview with Billboard, David Guetta said: \"I am so proud of what Nicki did on this record because we know her for those crazy raps but the other record that we have, she is singing like\u2014oh man. The world is gonna be shocked. Because they don't know her like this\" \"And we came up with that amazing song and she just killed it.\"\n\"Turn Me On\" is an EDM song and features Minaj on vocals. It is the second track from Nothing but the Beat that features Minaj, along with the single \"Where Them Girls At\". The song is written in the key of C minor, with a simple chord sequence of C minor-Bb major-Ab major. It is written in common time with a moderate dance groove of 128 beats per minute. Nicki Minaj's vocals span from G\u2083 to E\u266d\u2085 in the song.\nAl Fox of BBC Music wrote that \"the best results come when Guetta mercilessly rips artists from their comfort zone \u2013 take Minaj in songbird mode on 'Turn Me On.\" Allmusic's David Jeffries wrote that \"Nicki Minaj does a pole dance on the operating table for 'Turn Me On', while picking it as one of the best tracks on the album. Carol Cooper of Village Voice gave a review talking about her voice, writing that \"on 'Turn Me On' Nicki Minaj gamely shifts between her Madonna range and her Rihanna register.\" Ken Capobianco somewhat echoed the same thought of Cooper, writing that \" Nicki Minaj delivers solid singing on the track.\"\nJoe Copplestone of PopMatters wrote a mixed review, saying that \"the song showcases a suspiciously melodic performance by Minaj, with massive hooks that somehow let her make the transition from freak to diva.\"  Harley Brown of Consequence of Sound thought that the \"skipping beat and screaming synths are more recognizable as quintessential techno.\" Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club was more negative, writing that on the song Minaj is a \"faceless-disco-diva.\" Another negative review came from Idolator's Becky Bain, who dismissed \"Guetta's decision to take one of the most exciting rapper's today and not only have her not rap, but drown her in Auto-Tune.\"\n\nThe music video for \"Turn Me On\" was filmed in November 2011 by director Sanji. A sneak preview of the video was released on 27 January 2012 with the full video being released on 31 January.\nSet in a steampunk world, Guetta plays a mad scientist creating his very own Nicki Minaj from mechanical parts. The clip opens on Guetta, perhaps trying out some early cosmetic-surgery tactics, putting the final touches on his Minaj doll plans. Then it focuses on the mechanisms behind the Nicki being: latex lips, brass wiring, tubing and various other gizmos. As the song hits the chorus for the first time, fans get a view of his creation. Her plastic skin is shiny and completely bare as she slowly transforms into the very human-looking Nicki. Seemingly pleased with his creation, Guetta unleashes it onto the world. The entrance to the second verse shows Minaj, dressed in a long black dress, black top hat and shocking pink hip-length hair, leaving Guetta's studio through two black gates and is now free to roam the streets, filled with other doll-like creatures who can't help but stare at Guetta's incredibly lifelike"

It was released as the third song and second official single from the album following \"Chun-Li\" and \"Barbie Tingz\" on June 14, 2018, by Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records. The song was produced by Ben Billions, Beats Bailey, Supa Dups, and Messy; and features guest vocals by American singer Ariana Grande. It marks the fourth collaboration between the two. Commercially, the song peaked at number 42 on the US Billboard Hot 100, as well as reached the top 20 in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom.\nThe two artists collaborated on \"Bang Bang\" and \"Get On Your Knees\" in 2014. Ariana Grande released \"Side to Side\" featuring Nicki Minaj as the third single of her studio album Dangerous Woman (2016). It peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming her first top-five single from the album in the chart. In May 2018, Grande revealed via Twitter that Minaj called her in the morning and recorded what would be their next musical collaboration. On June 4, Grande replied to a follower on the same social network suggesting that there would be more than one collaboration between her and Minaj to be released through 2018, the other one being \"The Light Is Coming\". On June 11, Minaj officially announced \"Bed\" as the second single from her upcoming fourth studio album Queen (2018). It was released on June 14 for digital download, along with the album pre-order. The single has an Instagram-influenced faded cover art, that features Minaj and Grande posing in a pool.\n\"Bed\" was written by Minaj with LunchMoney Lewis, Mescon David Asher, Supa Dups, Brett Bailey, and Ben Diehl, while its production was done by the latter three alongside Messy. The track is three minutes and nine seconds long. It is a downtempo-inspired pop ballad. It employs a minimalist, tropical-infused instrumental, that was noted to be similar to Troye Sivan's \"Dance to This\" (2018). According to Spin, the song is about escaping to be intimate with a lover, with a third verse about oral sex. It references Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III album (2008) and singer Zayn Malik, with whom she later collaborated, on \"No Candle No Light\".\nJoshua Copperman of Spin called the song \"charming\", \"raunchy\", and \"forceful\", and described the instrumental as \"cloudy but decidedly pretty\". He found it nearly identical to Troye Sivan's \"Dance to This\", which is \"danceable\" in opposite to \"Bed\" which \"buries its groove in pure atmosphere\". Mitch Findlay of HotNewHipHop said the song is \"a breezy addition to Queen, an obligatory radio effort, tailor made for summer play.\" He adds that the track \"serves as intimate companion piece to \"Rich Sex\", and will no doubt appeal to a different set of ears.\" Mackenzie Cummings-Grady of Billboard finds that the \"bouncy bop\" nature of the song shows that \"the album, like Minaj's previous efforts, will be a combination of club-ready pop and hardcore hip hop.\"\n\"Bed\" debuted at number 43 on the US Billboard Hot 100 after a full week of tracking, with 19,000 downloads sold and 12 million streams. The song became Minaj's 91st entry on the chart, extending her record for most Hot 100 visits among women and tying James Brown for the seventh-best sum overall. It fell 24 positions to number 67 in its second week. In its fourth week, it rose to number 48, and later reached a peak of number 42 after her album Queen was released.\nOutside the United States, \"Bed\" also reached the top 20 in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nOn June 14, 2018, Minaj and Grande shared a 15-second video teaser for \"Bed\" via their Twitter accounts. It shows the two artists in a pool, lounging around in a foam bath. On June 19, Minaj posted another one-minute preview of the music video on YouTube. On July 4, she revealed via Instagram that the video will premiere two days later. On July 5, she shared a quick behind-the-scenes look at the video on her social media. It shows her rolling around on a beach dressed up as a mermaid with a green wig. The full music video premiered on Minaj's official YouTube and Vevo accounts on July 6, 2018.

It was released as the second single from 6ix9ine's second studio album, TattleTales (2020). It was postponed twice before being released on June 12, 2020, as the follow-up to \"Gooba\", released four weeks earlier. It was written by the artists, along with its producers Sadpony and Jahnei Clarke, the latter having also produced \"Gooba\". The song marked the third collaboration between the artists, following \"Fefe\" and \"Mama\", both released in 2018. Lyrically, the song takes aim at internet trolls. On June 16, 2020, a new version of the song was released, featuring a different verse from Minaj and an altered beat. It became the first song to top the Hot 100 charts from an indie label since XXXTentacion's Sad! in 2018. \"Trollz\" set the record for the largest drop down the chart from number one in Hot 100 history at the time, becoming the first single to fall over 34 positions in its second week after a number one debut. The record was subsequently broken in December 2020 by Taylor Swift's \"Willow\".\nAfter having been released from prison early, in April 2020, Hernandez released his first single after his prison sentence on May 8, 2020, titled \"Gooba\". Following his controversial accusations towards Billboard of rigging and chart manipulation, and towards pop singers Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's management of buying \"30,000 copies with six credit cards\" for their song \"Stuck with U\", 6ix9ine posted a photo of himself holding up six credit cards, writing in the caption, \"Don't worry we going #1 next time @billboard.\" On May 17, 2020, he announced that he would take a short hiatus from social media and release a video the following Friday. He also promised a new song set to be released on May 22 if \"Gooba\" got 10,000 downloads. However, the scheduled release was subsequently postponed to May 29. On May 23, he asked his fans to come up with the song title of his upcoming single, which turned out to be \"Trollz\". Shortly thereafter, Hernandez posted a video of himself confirming the title. The rapper further revealed that the song features another artist. On June 3, 6ix9ine announced the song was again delayed to June 12, stating it is \"out of respect for\" the ongoing George Floyd protests.\nMinaj reportedly visited 6ix9ine to film the music video in May 2020. On June 10, 2020, it was confirmed that Minaj was the previously announced guest artist via the official merchandise bundled with the song on her website.\nThe song is driven by an electronic drum backing track and contains a laconic beat. On the song, 6ix9ine employs his \"usual\" braggadocious delivery, with Minaj's lyrics containing sex euphemisms. Minaj explained that she recorded eleven different versions before the song was released in its final form.\nAlex Zidel of HotNewHipHop noted that Minaj's verse contains a possible dig at singer\u00a0Usher, when she raps: \"Somebody usher this\u00a0nigga into a clinic/My flow's still sick, I ain't talkin' a pandemic\". Shortly before the song's release, Usher had said Minaj\u00a0\"got her 'blueprint' from Lil Kim\", and he previously faced\u00a0herpes accusations.\nAn alternate version of the song was also released, which opens with Minaj's original verse, as she raps in English with Spanish words (\"He tryna put it in my culo, real fat gato / When he eat it, I tell him to squeeze it like a taco\"). Prior to the song's release, Minaj tweeted the taco emoji,\u00a0hinting\u00a0at the song's lyrics.\nJason Lipshutz of Billboard included the song among the most essential releases of the week, noting that 6ix9ine \"punctuates his verse with a throat-clearing assault\", while Minaj \"radiates slick confidence through sex euphemisms and nods to her longevity\". However, \"Trollz\" was included on a list of the worst songs of 2020 published by Variety.\nThe song debuted at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming 6ix9ine's first number-one single in the country, and Minaj's second and her first as lead artist. She also became the second female rapper to debut atop the Hot 100, following Lauryn Hill in 1998. The following week the song dropped to number 34, becoming the first song to fall over 30 positions after a number one debut, and breaking the record for largest drop down the chart from number one in Hot 100 history at the time. It spent a total of 4 weeks on the charts, marking the first time in Hot 100 history that a song that peaked at number one"

It first became prominent from the release of Drake's third mixtape of the same name. The song is also included on Drake's debut studio album Thank Me Later, as a bonus track on the Japanese version of the album, and on iTunes in several countries.\nIt was released as the third single from the album in the United Kingdom on October 11, 2010, as a double-A-side single with \"Fancy\". The song's popularity helped Drake decide to release So Far Gone as an EP, available for purchase. The song samples \"Fallin' in Love\" by Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds and \"Do It For The Boy\" by Lil Wayne.\n\"Best I Ever Had\" peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Drake's first top-ten single. It remained his highest charting single as a lead artist (as both Rihanna collaborations \"What's My Name?\" and \"Work\" reached No. 1) in the United States until \"One Dance\" (2016) peaked at number one.\nThe song was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Song. In early 2010 it was also nominated for Single of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards, but lost to Michael Bubl\u00e9's \"Haven't Met You Yet\".\nThe artwork originally showed  the single as a file on a computer with a plain white background, designed by artwork designer Darkie; this was deemed as too obscure by iTunes. A new cover was created by Darkie.\nKia Shine credited himself with the production of the hit single, claiming he co-wrote the song for Drake, entitling him with part ownership of the song. Shine had produced a mixtape track for Lil Wayne titled \"Do It for the Boy\" which \"Best I Ever Had\" interpolates. Shine had already received awards from Broadcast Music Incorporated for \"Best I Ever Had\". Drake maintained that he had never met Shine and admitted that he sampled the Lil Wayne song, but called the claim to the credit \"distasteful\".\nIn a lawsuit filed on June 24, 2010, Drake was sued for copyright infringement by Playboy Enterprises over allegations that \"Best I Ever Had\" samples American rock group Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds' 1975 hit \"Fallin' in Love\", a song to which Playboy owns the copyright. The suit named Drake, as well as Cash Money Records and Universal Music Group, and asserted that Playboy \"has suffered, and will continue to suffer irreparable injury\" from the alleged infringement. The lawsuit demanded that \"all infringing works be recalled and destroyed\". As part of its claim, Playboy also alleged that \"each defendant either knew, or should have reasonably known, that the sound recording was protected by copyright\".\nDrake told MTV News before his show at Manhattan's SOB's that he was in the process of  putting together a music video for the song. He explained: \"I been working with a  people on some ideas,\" he explained. \"I don't wanna say who yet, because everything isn't confirmed yet. It should be pretty solid in the next few days. The biggest thing about that song is that a lot of women come up to me and say, 'That's my song, because it really makes me feel special.' So I told the directors that were interested that I just want the visuals to coincide with that feeling. I want women to feel special when they watch the visual and say, 'I wish that was me,' or 'I know that feeling.' That's the goal with the video \u2014 to be genuine and not sappy. Be sexy and keep it together, but still make women smile.\"\nThe video, directed by Kanye West, was shot in Brooklyn, New York at Bishop Ford Central Catholic High School. Trey Songz, Fabolous, Consequence, and the song's producer Boi-1da made cameos in the video, as well as artists signed to Young Money Entertainment, such as Lil Twist, Shanell, and Lil Chuckee.\nA clip of the video was shown June 30, 2009, on It's On with Alexa Chung, and the full version of the video premiered on the internet on July 1, 2009. The full version of the video made its television debut on AMTV on July 2, 2009. There was criticism of the video in the media, including an article in the British newspaper The Guardian, highlighting the gratuitous focus on the unsupported implanted breasts and prominent posteriors of the female basketball players that Drake coaches in the video.\nA women's basketball team prepares for a game, primarily by stretching.

It was written by Drake with Boi-1da, and produced by the latter and Al Khaaliq (Nick Brongers). The orchestral samples were composed and arranged by Brongers. The single was released for digital download on March 8, 2010. The song is midtempo hip-hop with an orchestral backdrop, whose lyrics concern an introduction to fame.\nIt peaked in the top twenty of the United States and Canada, becoming Drake's fourth consecutive top twenty hit in the U.S. It also charted within the top five on the U.S. R&B and rap charts, his fourth consecutive top five on those charts. The song also charted in the United Kingdom and its R&B chart. The song's accompanying music video features Drake reflecting on an experience, and the struggle between his old life and the new. Several artists have made a freestyle over the track, including Eminem, Trey Songz, and Diggy Simmons, among others. Drake performed the song a number of times, including at the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards. The track received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. The song is also featured on the NBA 2K11 soundtrack.\n\"Shut It Down\" was originally planned to be released as the first single from Thank Me Later in late 2009, but Drake ultimately chose \"Over\", a song produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles \"Best I Ever Had\" and \"Forever\". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. Drake did a lot of work for the song and the album in Jamaica.\nThe song \"touches on Drake reaction to fame and stardom\"; Drake told MTV News that the song was \"definitely\" a choice of his for releasing as a single, and that it was a song he did for himself.  Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song \"a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness\". The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's \"Hip-Hop\", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his \"Thriller\" video, and commented, \"He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great\".\n\nThe video was shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, directed by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake on the video for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, \"The One\". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Mandler said he was a big Drake fan, and that Drake told him \"that nobody had really captured him\" on video\".\nBritish singer Rita Ora plays Drake's distant love interest in the video. It begins with Drake dressed sitting in a room on a bed, reflecting on his new life. Several images including explosions and cityscapes are shown on him and on the wall before the performance begins. Drake is later shown throughout the video in front of a gray backdrop, as he seems to be thinking about two women in his visions, Ora, who seems to portray the good girl, and another woman, who remained yet to be seen fully, portrayed as dangerous as she dances provocatively in the background. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the video \"artistically contradictory\". Scenes of Drake sitting \"alone in his bedroom\" are pensive and rebellious\", and called them \"controlled chaos\", but said that it worked in the video. Wete also pointed out that \"He chose not to go the cliche rap-video route and fill his four-minute flick with nearly naked women, Ciroc bottles, and Beamers\", and that he stuck with \"one leading lady\".\nSeveral artists have remixed or made a freestyle over the beat, including Eminem, B.o.B, Sean Kingston, Royce da 5'9\", Trey Songz, Fat Joe, Teairra Mar\u00ed, and Diggy Simmons. Simmons, the first to release a freestyle over the track, told Vibe, \"With that freestyle, I heard the track, loved"

It was released to rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on July 10, 2018, as the album's fifth single. The song features additional vocals by the City Girls, though they are uncredited on the official version. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for ten weeks and broke several records.\n\"In My Feelings\" is a bounce track. Upon its release, several outlets reported that the song and \"Kiki\" was about Keshia Chant\u00e9, Drake's first girlfriend and childhood friend from Toronto. It was also reported that \"KB\" was K'yanna Barber, a resident of Oakland, California. Drake also makes references to Jennifer Lopez (\"Jenny\"), whom he briefly dated in 2016, and Quality Control duo City Girls, made up of members Yung Miami (\"Resha\") and JT. The City Girls also provide uncredited vocals.\nThe track samples \"Smoking Gun (Acapella Version)\" by Magnolia Shorty for the breakdown. \"Lollipop\" by Lil Wayne is also sampled and the track ends with audio from the episode \"Champagne Papi\" from the television series Atlanta. The song was later slightly altered and re-uploaded to streaming sites with additional sampled vocals from Lil Wayne.\nThe song inspired an Internet meme dance challenge known as the \"Kiki Challenge\", \"In My Feelings Challenge\" or \"DoTheShiggy\", the latter being a reference to the comedian Shiggy, who posted a video on his Instagram account of him dancing to the song; this video was credited for inspiring the challenge. The dance challenge is to walk outside of moving vehicles (ghost riding) and dance in oncoming traffic. Originating in the US, the challenge later spread to other parts of the world where in some countries it caused controversy and public concern. The challenge is subject to fines on public roads in the Philippines.\nThe Fader deemed the bounce track as the highlight of the double album, with writer Ben Dandrige-Lemco saying, \"it takes a whole 20 songs to get to the best part of the album, 'In My Feelings'\". The Hollywood Reporter's Jonny Coleman felt that the song, along with \"Nice for What\", \"might be two of the most enduring tracks [in the album]\". Andy Hutchins of Time called the song \"a disastrous misunderstanding of New Orleans bounce.\"\nBillboard named \"In My Feelings\" the 42nd-best song of 2018.\nIn the Billboard magazine issue dated July 14, 2018, \"In My Feelings\" debuted at number six on the Billboard Hot 100, one of seven top 10 entries by Drake that week. The following week, partly due to the rising popularity of the dance challenge associated with the song, it ascended to the top spot of the chart, becoming Drake's sixth number-one single on the chart. On the issue dated July 28, 2018, \"In My Feelings\" broke the streaming record for the most streams in a single week with 116.2 million streams (later being broken by \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus on the week of April 13, 2019, which has the current record of 143 million streams) and retained the top spot on the chart. It remained on top for ten consecutive weeks until it was unseated by \"Girls Like You\" by Maroon 5 featuring Cardi B. It ultimately remained in the top ten for 14 weeks. It also reached number one on the Canadian Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.\nIn the UK, it did not enter the charts on the first week due to chart rules, but the next week, due to the popularity of the dance challenge, it entered at number four. A week later, it rose to number one, becoming Drake's fifth number one in the UK and his third consecutive number one in 2018. \"In My Feelings\" spent four weeks at the top of the chart, before being replaced by \"Shotgun\".\nThe success of \"In My Feelings\" made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers in the history of the Hot 100 chart.\nThe song's music video was shot on July 23, 2018, in New Orleans and was directed by Karena Evans, whom Drake previously worked with on the videos for \"God's Plan\", \"Nice for What\", and \"I'm Upset\" earlier in the year.\nThe song's music video was released on August 2, 2018, on Drake's YouTube channel. \"KeKe\" is played by La La Anthony while her mother is played by Phylicia Rashad. The video takes place in New Orleans and shows people dancing to the song, including Yung Miami of the City Girls and bounce music legend Big Freedia.  Comedian Shiggy, who has been"

It was written by Drake with Boi-1da, and produced by the latter and Al Khaaliq (Nick Brongers). The orchestral samples were composed and arranged by Brongers. The single was released for digital download on March 8, 2010. The song is midtempo hip-hop with an orchestral backdrop, whose lyrics concern an introduction to fame.\nIt peaked in the top twenty of the United States and Canada, becoming Drake's fourth consecutive top twenty hit in the U.S. It also charted within the top five on the U.S. R&B and rap charts, his fourth consecutive top five on those charts. The song also charted in the United Kingdom and its R&B chart. The song's accompanying music video features Drake reflecting on an experience, and the struggle between his old life and the new. Several artists have made a freestyle over the track, including Eminem, Trey Songz, and Diggy Simmons, among others. Drake performed the song a number of times, including at the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards. The track received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. The song is also featured on the NBA 2K11 soundtrack.\n\"Shut It Down\" was originally planned to be released as the first single from Thank Me Later in late 2009, but Drake ultimately chose \"Over\", a song produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles \"Best I Ever Had\" and \"Forever\". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. Drake did a lot of work for the song and the album in Jamaica.\nThe song \"touches on Drake reaction to fame and stardom\"; Drake told MTV News that the song was \"definitely\" a choice of his for releasing as a single, and that it was a song he did for himself.  Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song \"a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness\". The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's \"Hip-Hop\", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his \"Thriller\" video, and commented, \"He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great\".\n\nThe video was shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, directed by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake on the video for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, \"The One\". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Mandler said he was a big Drake fan, and that Drake told him \"that nobody had really captured him\" on video\".\nBritish singer Rita Ora plays Drake's distant love interest in the video. It begins with Drake dressed sitting in a room on a bed, reflecting on his new life. Several images including explosions and cityscapes are shown on him and on the wall before the performance begins. Drake is later shown throughout the video in front of a gray backdrop, as he seems to be thinking about two women in his visions, Ora, who seems to portray the good girl, and another woman, who remained yet to be seen fully, portrayed as dangerous as she dances provocatively in the background. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the video \"artistically contradictory\". Scenes of Drake sitting \"alone in his bedroom\" are pensive and rebellious\", and called them \"controlled chaos\", but said that it worked in the video. Wete also pointed out that \"He chose not to go the cliche rap-video route and fill his four-minute flick with nearly naked women, Ciroc bottles, and Beamers\", and that he stuck with \"one leading lady\".\nSeveral artists have remixed or made a freestyle over the beat, including Eminem, B.o.B, Sean Kingston, Royce da 5'9\", Trey Songz, Fat Joe, Teairra Mar\u00ed, and Diggy Simmons. Simmons, the first to release a freestyle over the track, told Vibe, \"With that freestyle, I heard the track, loved"

It was written by Alexander \"Fuego\" Palmer, Brown, Damon Thomas, Harvey Mason Jr., Michael \"Mike J\" Jimenez, Terence Coles and Agent X, while production was handled by Fuego and The Underdogs. \"Turn Up the Music\" was sent to contemporary hit radio playlists in the United States on February 7, 2012, as the lead single from Brown's fifth studio album Fortune (2012). It was released for digital download on February 10, 2012. \"Turn Up the Music\" is an uptempo song which draws from the genres of electronic dance and house. Instrumentation consists of pulsating beats,  synthesizers, a \"throbbing bass\" and percussion. According to Mason Jr., the song's inspiration came from visualizing Brown as an artist, \"how he dances and how he performs, and giving him something to match that energy.\"\n\"Turn Up the Music\" garnered positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its production and compared the song to Brown's previous singles \"Forever\" (2008) and \"Yeah 3x\" (2010), for its similar musical direction. Critics also noted its similarities to the work of LMFAO and David Guetta. \"Turn Up the Music\" achieved commercial success worldwide, becoming Brown's first number one single on the UK Singles Chart, and his eleventh top ten single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song also reached the top ten in Australia and New Zealand, and the top twenty in Canada, Hungary, Ireland and Slovakia. It was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).\nThe accompanying music video for \"Turn Up the Music\" was directed by Godfrey Taberez and Brown, and filmed in Los Angeles, California. It features Brown at a party filled with masked people, where he performs heavily choreographed dance routines. The video garnered positive reception from critics, for its series of dance sequences which were compared to Michael Jackson. It won Best Male Video and Best Choreography at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, and earned Taberez and Brown a nomination for Video Director of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards. Brown promoted the song with live performances on televised shows and at awards ceremonies, including Dancing with the Stars, Today, the 2012 NBA All-Star Game halftime show, the 54th Grammy Awards, the 2012 Billboard Music Awards and the BET Awards. He also included the song in his set list at Supafest Australia. The official remix of \"Turn Up the Music\" premiered online on February 20, 2012, and features Brown's former girlfriend Rihanna.\n\"Turn Up the Music\" was written by Alexander \"Fuego\" Palmer, Chris Brown, Damon Thomas, Harvey Mason Jr., Michael \"Mike J\" Jimenez, Terence Cole and Agent X. Production for the song was handled by Fuego and The Underdogs. The mixing engineering process was completed by John Hanes with assistance by Phil Seaford, while the audio mixing was completed by Serban Ghenea. \"Turn Up the Music\" was recorded at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California and Mason Sound in North Hollywood, California by Andrew Hey and Brian Springer with assistance by Iain Findley. In an interview with MTV News, Mason Jr. revealed that inspiration for the song came from visualizing Brown as an artist. He explained, \"The inspiration was really him as an artist, visualizing how he dances and how he performs, and giving him something to match that energy.\"\nOn January 25, 2012, Brown announced via his official Twitter account that the lead single from his fifth studio album Fortune would be called \"Turn Up the Music\", tweeting \"New FORTUNE single coming 1/26!!! TURN UP THE MUSIC!!!!\". The following day, both the single and its artwork were posted online, showing Brown wearing an unbuttoned shirt and a fedora, while words in different languages are displayed. \"Turn Up the Music\" was officially sent to contemporary hit radio playlists in the United States on February 7, 2012. It was released as a one-track digital download in Oceania and most European countries on February 10, 2012. However, in the United Kingdom, \"Turn Up the"

Kelly (Remix). \"Promise\" is a song performed by American recording artist Ciara from her second studio album, Ciara: The Evolution (2006). It was written by Ciara, Jasper Cameron, Polow da Don and Elvis Williams and produced by Polow da Don. The remix features singer R. Kelly. The song was released as the album's official lead single on October 16, 2006, through LaFace Records. The song was selected as the first single as Ciara wanted to put out a single with a slower pace, noting that her previous releases had been up-tempo. According to Ciara, the song represents the album's theme of evolving and symbolizes her growth as a songwriter and artist.\n\"Promise\" is a mid-tempo R&B ballad with lyrics that describe what the protagonist wants out of love. The song received generally positive reviews from critics, who made comparisons with songs by musician Prince. Critics also observed that it was different and refreshing from Ciara's previous singles. \"Promise\" topped the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the United States and peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Ciara's best-performing single sans a featured artist on both charts. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping over one million copies.\nDiane Martel directed the song's accompanying music video, which features scenes of Ciara singing into a gravity-defying microphone. Ciara stated that it is just about performance as she wanted to make a distinct R&B video. The video received a BET Award nomination for Viewer's Choice in 2007.\n\"Promise\" was one of the first songs to be recorded for Ciara's sophomore effort, Ciara: The Evolution. The song was conceived as a \"feel-good\" record; Ciara explained that the goal was to create a song that \"truly is a sing-along\". She elaborated, \"I want you to be able to go back to the old days, and put your hands up and rock from side to side and just feel good.\" The singer wrote it in collaboration with Jasper Cameron, Elvis Williams and its producer, Jamal \"Polow da Don\" Jones. The recording session took place at Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and co-writer Williams provided backing vocals. Ciara and Cameron produced the vocals and Phil Tan later mixed the song at Soapbox Studios in Los Angeles, California. On the album, \"Promise\" is preceded by the spoken-word interlude \"The Evolution of Music\", in which Ciara shares that music on the radio inspired her to \"do something different this time around\".\nIn an interview with Corey Moss for MTV News, Ciara stated that \"Promise\" is about being single as she had ended her one-year relationship with rapper Bow Wow several months prior in April 2006. She named her album The Evolution as she felt evolved, both as a woman and an artist and stated that the song symbolizes her growth. She said that it was \"perfect\" as the first single because it makes a statement. \"The record was something different from what people were used to hearing me do. So this record does have a more mature sounding, sexier vibe\", she said. Ciara declared \"Promise\" as \"different\" from her other work, and considered it one of the album's most unusual and strongest songs, citing the production as an example of this. Polow da Don told Billboard that the song is \"young but sexy\" and noted that \"nobody's really heard [Ciara] do a ballad\". In an interview with Mark Edward Nero for About.com, Ciara explained why she selected \"Promise\" as the album's first official single, noting that it has a different tempo from her previous singles:\nWhen I did a recap of all the records I released prior to my first single for this album, I noticed that all of them were up-tempo. ... and I wanted to change it up and still make sure the elements, ... that people know me and my fans know me for were still in there such as the dancing so, ... I wanted to try something different, ... change the pace a little bit and that's what I did with this record. I felt it was perfect for that.\n\"Promise\" is a mid-tempo R&B song.

The song features American rapper Lil Wayne who co-wrote the song alongside Hilson and Zachary Anson Wallace. Production credits are shared between Danja and Polow da Don, who also co-wrote the song. Following the minimal chart success of Hilson's worldwide lead single \"Energy\" in the United States, international markets received \"Return the Favor\", while \"Turnin Me On\" was released as the third single in the US.\nAfter experimenting with more pop-oriented music in her previous mentioned songs, Hilson opted for a more urban, hip-hop flavored sound for the song, due to her wanting to keep to her roots. While noting her less than stellar vocals on the track, critics praised Hilson's sassiness and attitude on the track and complimented Lil Wayne's verse, which has been called the best surprise rap since Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes on TLC's \"Waterfalls.\" The song's accompanying music video features intricate Aaliyah and \"Soldier\"-esque choreography, dance scenes such as the Bird Walk, and Hilson being flaunted by men. The scenes are intercut with mirror scenes with younger kids.\nThe song was a commercial success in the United States, reaching number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100, whilst reaching two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"Turnin Me On\" received two nominations at the 2009 BET Awards, and a \"Song of the Year\" nomination at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards. A leaked remix of the song caused controversy, with rumors that Hilson was taking shots at fellow female R&B singers Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Ciara; however, Hilson has fervently denied the rumors that it was a diss. Hilson performed the song as a part of a medley at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards and BET Awards.\nIn June 2008, Rap-Up originally reported the song as \"Turn Off\", while Hilson was playing it at Interscope-Geffen-A&M Records' second annual \"Creme of the Crop\" post-BET Awards dinner on June 25, 2008. Then an unmastered version of \"Turn Off\" was leaked online in September 2008. After selecting the predominantly pop-sounding \"Energy\" and \"Return the Favor\", Hilson selected \"Turnin Me On\" as In a Perfect World...'s third single. When asked in an interview with That Grape Juice if choosing the song was a conscious effort, since the song had a different sound than the previous singles, Hilson responded, \n\"Absolutely! I mean, there\u2019s another side of me. I\u2019m from Decatur, Georgia and that is a predominantly black neighbourhood with a lot of lower-class and some middle-class neighbourhoods. I guess that is the song that probably properly describes the type of girl I am, in relation to where I\u2019m from. So yeah, it was definitely a conscious effort to make sure that I stay close to home on some records.\"\nThe song is a futuristic-esque R&B, synth-driven, bass-heavy urban song, featuring \"bouncy\" horn samples. Written in the key of C minor the song is in a \"moderate R&B groove\". It is set in common time and Hilson's vocals span from the low note of G\u2083 to the high note of C\u2085 \" \"Turnin Me On\" is lyrically about physical attraction and composed in a hard-edged tone.\" MTV Buzzworthy described the song \"as one-part Rihanna 'Umbrella' and two parts Beyonc\u00e9 'Ring the Alarm'\"\nNaming it a standout track from In a Perfect World... Andy Kellman of AllMusic called the song a \"coquettish trunk rattler.\" Barry Walters of Spin complimented Hilson's \"sassiness\" on the song which she \"wore well.\" MTV Buzzworthy called the Wayne's verse \"the best surprise rap since Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes' verse in TLC's 'Waterfalls.'\" J.K. Glei of Cincinnati Metromix called the track \"playful\" and said the track was easily the album's standout, commenting that Lil Wayne's cameo \"steals the show.\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commended the song, calling it \"tight.\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said called the song \"slinky\"  and said, \"the busyness coheres, with Ms. Hilson neatly gliding among the song\u2019s many layers. And she may need the crutch; she is a careful, slight singer.\" Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times called the song \"impeccably arranged.\" After watching the video, a writer for BET Sound Off said after it seemed Hilson and her label were losing faith, that \"out of nowhere, Keri got her ish together\", and said, \"I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll regain the steam she lost"

It was written by Ciara, Jasper Cameron, Polow da Don and Elvis Williams and produced by Polow da Don. The remix features singer R. Kelly. The song was released as the album's official lead single on October 16, 2006, through LaFace Records. The song was selected as the first single as Ciara wanted to put out a single with a slower pace, noting that her previous releases had been up-tempo. According to Ciara, the song represents the album's theme of evolving and symbolizes her growth as a songwriter and artist.\n\"Promise\" is a mid-tempo R&B ballad with lyrics that describe what the protagonist wants out of love. The song received generally positive reviews from critics, who made comparisons with songs by musician Prince. Critics also observed that it was different and refreshing from Ciara's previous singles. \"Promise\" topped the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the United States and peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Ciara's best-performing single sans a featured artist on both charts. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping over one million copies.\nDiane Martel directed the song's accompanying music video, which features scenes of Ciara singing into a gravity-defying microphone. Ciara stated that it is just about performance as she wanted to make a distinct R&B video. The video received a BET Award nomination for Viewer's Choice in 2007.\n\"Promise\" was one of the first songs to be recorded for Ciara's sophomore effort, Ciara: The Evolution. The song was conceived as a \"feel-good\" record; Ciara explained that the goal was to create a song that \"truly is a sing-along\". She elaborated, \"I want you to be able to go back to the old days, and put your hands up and rock from side to side and just feel good.\" The singer wrote it in collaboration with Jasper Cameron, Elvis Williams and its producer, Jamal \"Polow da Don\" Jones. The recording session took place at Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and co-writer Williams provided backing vocals. Ciara and Cameron produced the vocals and Phil Tan later mixed the song at Soapbox Studios in Los Angeles, California. On the album, \"Promise\" is preceded by the spoken-word interlude \"The Evolution of Music\", in which Ciara shares that music on the radio inspired her to \"do something different this time around\".\nIn an interview with Corey Moss for MTV News, Ciara stated that \"Promise\" is about being single as she had ended her one-year relationship with rapper Bow Wow several months prior in April 2006. She named her album The Evolution as she felt evolved, both as a woman and an artist and stated that the song symbolizes her growth. She said that it was \"perfect\" as the first single because it makes a statement. \"The record was something different from what people were used to hearing me do. So this record does have a more mature sounding, sexier vibe\", she said. Ciara declared \"Promise\" as \"different\" from her other work, and considered it one of the album's most unusual and strongest songs, citing the production as an example of this. Polow da Don told Billboard that the song is \"young but sexy\" and noted that \"nobody's really heard [Ciara] do a ballad\". In an interview with Mark Edward Nero for About.com, Ciara explained why she selected \"Promise\" as the album's first official single, noting that it has a different tempo from her previous singles:\nWhen I did a recap of all the records I released prior to my first single for this album, I noticed that all of them were up-tempo. ... and I wanted to change it up and still make sure the elements, ... that people know me and my fans know me for were still in there such as the dancing so, ... I wanted to try something different, ... change the pace a little bit and that's what I did with this record. I felt it was perfect for that.\n\"Promise\" is a mid-tempo R&B song.

It features American musician Nile Rodgers, and was co-written by Sia Furler in collaboration with Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. The track was produced by Elliott Wheeler and The Get Down director, Baz Luhrmann. While it was available to download from the soundtrack upon its release, it was promoted in Italy to contemporary hit radio as a single on August 23, 2016. Various remixes were also released throughout the following month.\nMusically, \"Telepathy\" is a disco track reminiscent of the genre in the 1970s, reflecting the theme of the TV series, which documents the fall of disco and the rise of hip hop in that era. Aguilera's strong vocals were praised by music critics, with one in particular comparing her falsetto melismas to the style of Mariah Carey. \"Telepathy\" became Aguilera's ninth and Rodgers' fourth number-one song on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, respectively. As a thank you gift to her fans, radio, and DJs for playing the track and making it number-one on the chart, Aguilera self-produced a short, disco-themed music video for the song.\nComposed and written by Sia Furler, Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, \"Telepathy\" is a song recorded by Christina Aguilera featuring Nile Rodgers for the accompanying soundtrack to the Netflix musical drama series The Get Down (2016). The Get Down, directed by Australian Baz Luhrmann, is set in The Bronx in the late 1970s and chronicles the fall of disco and the rise of hip hop. Luhrmann, alongside Elliot Wheeler, produced \"Telepathy\", marking the second time he and Aguilera had worked together; Luhrmann directed the 2001 musical film Moulin Rouge! whereby Aguilera was one of the lead acts on the soundtrack single \"Lady Marmalade\". Furler recorded a demo version of the song but it has never been officially released.\nThe track listing for the soundtrack was released on August 4, 2016; Mike Wass of Idolator noted that \"Telepathy\" could possibly be a disco track given that Rodgers is credited as a featured artist and the disco theme of the series. \"Telepathy\" premiered on August 11, the day before the release of the soundtrack and TV series. The song was released in Italy to contemporary hit radio on August 23. Multiple remixes were commissioned and made available for digital download. On September 16, a six-track remix EP was released featuring remixes by Rare Candy, Eric Kupper, Solidisco, Malay & Young Bombs, Tobtok and Moto Blanco. Another remix by Le Youth was released September 30. Daniel Megarry of the Gay Times suggested that the release of the remixes was an effort to boost sales of the track.\n\"Telepathy\" is a disco song which lasts for a duration of three minutes, eleven seconds. The \"dreamy\" and \"euphoric\" instrumentation, provided by Nile Rodgers, Homer Steinweiss, Nick Movshon and Thomas Brenneck, consists of \"vibrant\" strings and horns, drums, brass and harps. PopCrush writer Bradley Stern noted that the addition of Rodgers \"signature joyful, dance floor-friendly\" sound adds a \"touch of authenticity\". Producer Nelson George described the track as being reminiscent of \"1970s vogueing anthems popular at vogue-club balls like the House of LaBeija.\" Entertainment Weekly writer Joey Nolfi placed \"Telepathy\" somewhere in between the compositions of her fifth studio album Back to Basics (2006) and the lead single from her seventh album Lotus, \"Your Body\" (2012).\n\"Telepathy\" garnered a positive response from music critics. Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass was initially underwhelmed by \"Telepathy\" upon its release. According to him, he downloaded the song regardless, and added it to what he calls his \"Upbeat Xtina\" playlist. He writes that a few months later, the song played on shuffle and he realized that he had previously brushed off what he now believed to be one of the best and most underrated songs of 2016. Robbie Daw of the same publication was complimentary of Aguilera's vocal performance, opining that she \"sings beautifully amidst a swirling wall of sound.\" He continued to write that it was a welcome change of tempo following the release of her previous single, \"Change\".\nBradley Stern from PopCrush described the song as a \"shimmering, strut-friendly contribution to the soundtrack\" and"

The single was released to the iTunes Store on 16 May and to shops on 29 May 2006. \"Is It Any Wonder?\" debuted at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart on 28 May 2006 based on download sales alone but reached number three with physical sales added on 4 June. The song was officially premiered on 17 April 2006 on Jo Whiley's BBC Radio 1 show. Soon after this, it was leaked onto the Internet.\nThe song was featured in the video games Madden NFL 07 and Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2. The song was nominated for the Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal for the 2007 Grammy Awards.\n\"Is It Any Wonder?\" was composed by Tim Rice-Oxley in 2005, being first demoed the same year. The guitar effects originate from Tim's distorted Yamaha CP70 piano. An early demo appeared on the Under the Iron Sea DVD.\nIt was mainly recorded at The Magic Shop studios, New York City and programmed and engineered by Andy Green.\n\"Is It Any Wonder?\" was composed under an 8-beat  time signature and a 130-bpm tempo. The main key of the riff is A major, alternating to G major when the bass starts playing.\nThe song starts with bashing piano notes, leading to Tim-Rice Oxley's deep distortion piano sound that is used to emulate abrasive electric guitar riffs. Bass guitar lines, synthesizers, and drums begin to finally introduce Tom Chaplin with the vocals of the first verse. Rice-Oxley continues to play regular and distortion piano notes throughout the verses of the song. As with almost all Keane songs, it includes a bridge after the second chorus, preceding the outro. Live performances show several differences from the studio version. Firstly, the deep sound is changed for the same synthesizer used for the whole song, which is also quite different from the one of the studio album. During the first verse of the original version, a synthesizer is used as a background for Chaplin's singing. However, on the live performance, Rice-Oxley keeps playing his distorted Yamaha CP70 piano throughout the song, instead of the synthesizer. Finally, drumming on the main riffs is modified, with Hughes beating the crash cymbal again and again.\nThe song is about the Iraq War: \nIt's probably the one song on the record that most expresses our dismay and confusion about what it means to be a British citizen, in terms of what our society's contributing to the world at large,\" Rice-Oxley explains. \"It's very hard to make sense of why Britain feels it needs to sign up with George Bush's attacks on Iraq and the whole Afghanistan thing. It feels like there's a whole lot of trouble brewing up over Iran, and you just don't know where it's going to end. On a personal level, for people of our age, it's really unsettling...\nThe song is not an attempt at some sort of wide-sweeping political statement, it's just about just seeing things from a personal level - what are you supposed to believe, what is actually right? How can you work out what is the truth, and what is the right thing to do? And there's so many different opinions, and you're supposed to have an opinion on what your country is doing, and yet it is so hard to even begin to gather all the facts. It's really distressing thing for people of our generation I think, the feeling of not being able to do anything about that. I guess that was something we were all feeling very acutely in the song. And I think the sounds of the song sum that up in a very tangible way.\nDirected by Kevin Godley, the video is almost the same throughout the song. A camera moves along a metal track like a roller coaster. The camera runs through rails until the end of it, stopping again. Keane are in the middle of it, with Tom appearing sometimes on the scene. The CD+DVD edition of Under the Iron Sea includes a trailer for the making of the video, as well as the videoclip.\nThe cover artwork for the single was designed by Sanna Annukka Smith, a Finnish artist in March 2006. Sanna originally wanted a red bird crying and Keane wanted a lonely soldier. During the first two weeks of April, the cover showed a soldier but the definite version shows the red bird crying on the soldier's shoulder, with the soldier referring to war. Some versions didn't include the bird, like the first cover. The crying bird later appeared on the cover for \"Try Again\". Similar to the"

The song was written collaboratively by all the band members for their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head. The track is built around thumping drums and chiming guitars. It was released on 5 August 2002 as the lead single from A Rush of Blood to the Head and reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song also reached number 17 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks.\n\"In My Place\" was well received by critics, who complimented its arrangement and profound lyrics. The song won the award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards.\nIn an interview with Q magazine, lead singer Chris Martin stated that \"In My Place\" was a song Coldplay had left after recording their debut album Parachutes (2000). When the band finished recording their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head, Martin said that the album was complete. However, after guitarist Jonny Buckland played the song on his guitar, Martin said that they now needed to record it and include it on the album. Martin also said that: \"That's about where you're put in the world, and how you're given your position, and the way you look, and how you have to get on with it.\" In an interview, Buckland revealed that the song was hard to record, as the band had played the song live. He also commented that when they started recording the song, they did not know how it should sound, due to the band members' contrasting ideas.\nThe song opens with a single crash cymbal followed by two bars of 4/4 drumming, then a plaintive three-note guitar line rings through a strummy rhythm, and Martin's vocals. Its instrumentation is varied with the sound of thumping drums, chiming guitars, a singalong chorus, and a string arrangement. The song also features guitar licks. The lyrics emphasise: \"But I wait for you/if you go, if you go/leave me down here on my own/then I'll wait for you.\" The song's lyrics also include references to a desire for weary optimism.\nThe song is written in the key of A major. It has been noted that the song's drum intro bears a close resemblance to the beginning of the Ride song \"Dreams Burn Down\".\nCritics were positive towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly review of the album, critic David Browne wrote: \"Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (''...You were an island / And I passed you by'' in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle.\" Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: \"When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin\u2019s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, \"Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me,\" he totally sells it, and you buy it. And why not? The song's lovely.\nAmy M. Bruce of The Towerlight wrote: \"With a slew of introspective rock songs like 'In My Place' and 'God Put a Smile upon Your Face,' this album is worthy of the hype surrounding the band's first album.\" Jules Willis of the BBC wrote: \"The second track, the first written post-Parachutes and sounding like a refugee from that album, is the grower 'In My Place'. It's a fantastic pop tune that justifies Coldplay's status as one of UK's most exciting bands.\"\nColdplay released \"In My Place\" in the US and UK on 5 August 2002 as the album's lead single. The single was pressed with two B-sides: \"One I Love\" and \"I Bloom Blaum\". The single cover features Buckland, with art directed by S\u00f8lve Sundsb\u00f8.\n\"In My Place\" peaked at number two on UK Singles Chart on 17 August 2002, kept off the top by \"Colourblind\" by Darius Danesh. It stayed in the chart until 23 November 2002. The song reached number seventeen on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 2002. The band were yet to have a number one single. In 2005, \"Speed of Sound\", the lead single of the band's third album, X&Y, also reached number two, but never the number one position. \"Speed of Sound\" was marked as Coldplay's most successful single until \"Viva la Vida\", reached number one in 2008.\nThe music video for \"In My Place\" was directed by Sophie Muller. It debuted on 17 June 2002 on AOL. It features the band playing in a huge, nearly empty,"

It is (to date) the longest titled song to ever chart in Billboard and was conveniently shortened to \"Stars on 45 Medley\", or \"'Medley' by Stars on 45\".

He found singers who sounded similar to John Lennon and Paul McCartney and decided to make the single focus on The Beatles. The Beatles medley was later extended to a full 16-minute album side. It appeared on the Stars on 45's first full-length release, Long Play Album (US title: Stars on Long Play; UK title: Stars on 45 - The Album).\nThe album version of the song moved \"Venus\" and \"Sugar Sugar\" to Side Two into a different medley, and added several more Beatles songs as well as a 32-second instrumental extract from George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord\" and even a fleeting reference to new wave band Sparks' \"Beat the Clock,\" for a total length of about 15 minutes.

A detailed listing of the source material can be found in the Long Play Album article.\nThe song also became a huge success in the UK where it kicked off a craze for medleys, with a large number of records in the Stars on 45 mould reaching the UK Top 40 in 1981. For example, The Hollies recorded \"Holliedaze\", a medley of some of their previous hits, which reached 28 on the UK charts with Graham Nash and Eric Haydock briefly rejoining the group in September 1981 to promote the record. Likewise, in the US the song started a medley craze that lasted for about a year and introduced not only other medleys by Stars on 45, but medleys by the Beatles themselves, The Beach Boys, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Larry Elgart and His Manhattan Swing Orchestra, as well as others.\n\nSide one\n\"Stars on 45\" (Medley - 7\" Mix) - 4:48 (US: - 4:05)\n\"Stars on 45\" (Eggermont, Duiser - omitted on the US version)\n\"Venus\" (van Leeuwen)\n\"Sugar, Sugar\" (Kim, Barry)\n\"No Reply\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"I'll Be Back\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Drive My Car\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"We Can Work It Out\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"I Should Have Known Better\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Nowhere Man\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"You're Going to Lose That Girl\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Stars on 45\" (Eggermont, Duiser)\nIncludes uncredited musical references to Sparks' song \"Beat the Clock\"\nSide two\n\"Stars on 45\" (Theme - 7\" Mix) (Eggermont, Duiser) - 3:30\nIncludes uncredited musical references to Lipps Inc.'s \"Funkytown\" and The"

The song first appeared on the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album in 1973. \"Bennie and the Jets\" has been one of John's most popular songs and was performed during his appearance at Live Aid.\nThe track was a massive hit in the United States and Canada, released in 1974 as an A-side and spelt 'Bennie'. In most territories the track was released as the B-side to \"Candle in the Wind\", but spelt 'Benny'. Album artwork (back-cover track listing and centre-panel design) consistently lists the song as 'Bennie' while either 'Bennie' or 'Benny' appears on the vinyl album depending on territory. The track was released as an A-side in the UK in 1976, as \"Benny and the Jets\".\nIt is ranked number 371 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\nThe song tells of \"Bennie and the Jets\", a fictional band of whom the song's narrator is a fan. In interviews, Taupin has said that the song's lyrics are a satire on the music industry of the 1970s. The greed and glitz of the early 1970s music scene is portrayed by Taupin's words:\nWe'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around,\nyou're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound.\nTaupin also goes on to describe the flashy wardrobe of \"Bennie\", the leader of the band:\nShe's got electric boots, a mohair suit\nYou know I read it in a magazine Ohh...\nProduced by Gus Dudgeon, the song was recorded during the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road sessions in France at Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville's Strawberry Studios, where John and Taupin had recorded their previous two albums, Honky Ch\u00e2teau and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player.\nJohn rarely plays the studio version of the song, and often makes subtle or even drastic changes. Live, the piano solo in the middle of the song has been played in all sorts of variations, from very close to the original to wildly improvised and extended versions, such as the elaborate version during a Central Park concert in 1980 and another memorable take on it during the \"Elton and his band\" part of the show recorded for what would become Live in Australia in December 1986. (It can be seen on various Laserdisc releases of the show.) He has also been known to end the song in a wide range of styles, including classical, swing, boogie-woogie and even using the signature five-note phrase from John Williams' score for Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\nDespite sounding as though recorded live, the song was actually recorded in studio, with live sound effects added in later. Producer Gus Dudgeon explained:\nFor some weird reason, Elton happened to have hit the opening piano chord of the song exactly one bar before the song actually started. So I was doing the mix and this chord kept coming on which you normally wouldn't expect to hear. I turned to engineer [David Hentschel] and I said, \u2018What does that remind you of? \u2026 It's the sort of thing that people do on stage just before they're going to start a song.\u2019 Just to kind of get everybody, \u2018Okay, here we go, ready?\u2019 For some reason that chord being there made me think, \u2018Maybe we should fake-live this.\u2019\nHe mixed in sounds from a 1972 performance of John in Royal Festival Hall and a 1970 Jimi Hendrix concert at the Isle of Wight. He also included a series of whistles from a live concert in Vancouver, and added hand claps and various shouts.\nThe song was the closing track on side one of the album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and John was set against releasing it as a single, believing it would fail. CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, began heavy airplay of the song and it became the #1 song in the Detroit market. This attention caused other American and Canadian Top 40 stations to add it to their playlists as well. As a result, the song peaked at #1 on the US singles chart in 1974. In the US, it was certified Gold on 8 April 1974 and Platinum on 13 September 1995 by the RIAA, and had sold 2.8 million copies by August 1976.\n\"Bennie and the Jets\" was also John's first Top 40 hit on what at the time was called the Billboard Hot Soul Singles chart, where it peaked at #15, the highest position out of the three of his singles which reached that chart. The acceptance of \"Bennie\" on R&B radio helped land John, a huge soul music fan, a guest appearance on the 17 May 1975 edition of Soul Train, where he played \"Bennie and the Jets\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom\". In Canada, it held the #1 spot on the RPM national singles chart for two weeks (13\u201320 April), becoming his"

It appeared on the Stars on 45's first full-length release, Long Play Album (US title: Stars on Long Play; UK title: Stars on 45 - The Album).\nThe album version of the song moved \"Venus\" and \"Sugar Sugar\" to Side Two into a different medley, and added several more Beatles songs as well as a 32-second instrumental extract from George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord\" and even a fleeting reference to new wave band Sparks' \"Beat the Clock,\" for a total length of about 15 minutes. The album version was released as Long Play Album in the Netherlands, and retitled Stars on Long Play in the US and Stars on 45 \u2014 The Album in the UK. A detailed listing of the source material can be found in the Long Play Album article.\nThe song also became a huge success in the UK where it kicked off a craze for medleys, with a large number of records in the Stars on 45 mould reaching the UK Top 40 in 1981. For example, The Hollies recorded \"Holliedaze\", a medley of some of their previous hits, which reached 28 on the UK charts with Graham Nash and Eric Haydock briefly rejoining the group in September 1981 to promote the record. Likewise, in the US the song started a medley craze that lasted for about a year and introduced not only other medleys by Stars on 45, but medleys by the Beatles themselves, The Beach Boys, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Larry Elgart and His Manhattan Swing Orchestra, as well as others.\n\nSide one\n\"Stars on 45\" (Medley - 7\" Mix) - 4:48 (US: - 4:05)\n\"Stars on 45\" (Eggermont, Duiser - omitted on the US version)\n\"Venus\" (van Leeuwen)\n\"Sugar, Sugar\" (Kim, Barry)\n\"No Reply\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"I'll Be Back\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Drive My Car\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"We Can Work It Out\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"I Should Have Known Better\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Nowhere Man\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"You're Going to Lose That Girl\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Stars on 45\" (Eggermont, Duiser)\nIncludes uncredited musical references to Sparks' song \"Beat the Clock\"\nSide two\n\"Stars on 45\" (Theme - 7\" Mix) (Eggermont, Duiser) - 3:30\nIncludes uncredited musical references to Lipps Inc.'s \"Funkytown\" and The"

It was produced by Starr's former Beatles bandmate George Harrison, who also helped write the song, although only Starr is credited. Recording for the track took place in March 1970 at Trident Studios in London, with overdubs added in October. Starr and Harrison performed the song together in August 1971 at Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh shows in New York City, a recording from which was released on the live album of the same name. Starr has continued to perform it in subsequent decades with his All-Starr Band.\nApart from in North America, where \"Beaucoups of Blues\" had been a single in October 1970, \"It Don't Come Easy\" was Starr's first single release since the break-up of the Beatles. Heavily promoted by Apple Records, the song was a commercial success, peaking at number 1 in Canada and number 4 on singles charts in the UK and the US. It was critically well received on release and remains one of his most popular hits as a solo artist.\nRingo Starr began writing \"It Don't Come Easy\" in late 1968, having recently completed his first composition, \"Don't Pass Me By\". When referring to his early songwriting efforts in a 2003 interview, he described himself as \"great at writing two verses and a chorus\" but often unable to develop the ideas further. Although Starr received sole writing credit for \"It Don't Come Easy\", Beatles historian Bruce Spizer writes that he had \"substantial, but uncredited, assistance\" from his bandmate George Harrison. In author Robert Rodriguez's description, the official songwriting credit was long thought to be \"bogus\" and, notwithstanding Starr's involvement, a sign of Harrison's \"great generosity\" in wanting to help the drummer establish himself independently of the Beatles.\nThe song's original title was \"You Gotta Pay Your Dues\". Starr completed it as the Beatles were heading towards disbandment in early 1970, following John Lennon's unpublicised decision to leave the group in September 1969. Starr said that in trying to find a song that would establish his identity at this time, he had to \"combat\u00a0... the original image of me as the downtrodden drummer\", adding, \"You don't know how hard it is to fight that.\" In journalist Bob Woffinden's view, as \"It Don't Come Easy\", the title alone \"[betrayed] a wealth of information\" about Starr's feelings of vulnerability while the other Beatles, as proven songwriters, could each look to further their achievements outside the band.\nIn its completed form, the song opens and closes with a lead guitar riff. Music historian Andrew Grant Jackson describes the lyrics as \"Starr's exhortation to stay resilient in the face of hardship\", and he views the reference to paying \"your dues\" as an apt image, given Starr's health issues as a child and limited education. In Rodriguez's view, the song was most likely inspired by \"a Ringo-ism or two\", but the guitar riff, \"quasi-philosophical\" lyrics and other musical details make it a typical Harrison composition from the period.\nStarr subsequently acknowledged that Harrison helped write \"It Don't Come Easy\". He discussed the song's creation during his appearance on VH1 Storytellers in 1998. Starr said: \"I wrote this song with the one and only George Harrison.\" He went on to say that Harrison suggested the last verse be about God. When Starr protested, Harrison suggested Hare Krishna. Starr protested again, and Harrison suggested \"peace\" as a topic, and they settled on that.\n\nStarr first recorded the new composition during the sessions for Sentimental Journey. The latter project was an album of pre-rock 'n' roll standards that he undertook to keep active following Lennon's decision, and to please his mother. Recording for the song began at all-night session on 18 February 1970 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios), with George Martin producing. The studio log listed the track as \"You Gotta Pay Your Dues\". Harrison played acoustic guitar and directed the other musicians \u2013 namely Starr (on drums), Klaus Voormann (bass) and Stephen Stills (piano). They taped 20 takes of the basic track. Starr added a vocal to the take selected as best and Harrison two electric guitar parts, and by 4.40am the recording had been mixed.\nOn 19 February, after final overdubs were carried out on \"Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing\" during an afternoon session at EMI, recording resumed on \"You Gotta Pay Your Dues\", with Starr adding another lead vocal. Harrison was not present that evening, although Eric"

In some countries, including the UK, Ireland and New Zealand, the band was credited as 'Starsound' and only the medley itself was named \"Stars on 45\".\nIts official title in the US and Canada (as on the record and in Billboard and RPM) is \"Medley: Intro 'Venus' / Sugar Sugar / No Reply / I'll Be Back / Drive My Car / Do You Want to Know a Secret / We Can Work It Out / I Should Have Known Better / Nowhere Man / You're Going to Lose That Girl / Stars on 45\" and was credited to 'Stars on 45'. It is (to date) the longest titled song to ever chart in Billboard and was conveniently shortened to \"Stars on 45 Medley\", or \"'Medley' by Stars on 45\". The length of the name surpassed the previous record set by Ray Stevens' \"Jeremiah Peabody's Polyunsaturated Quick-Dissolving Fast-Acting Pleasant-Tasting Green and Purple Pills;\" and (among songs that reached number one) \"(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song\"  by B. J. Thomas.  The reason for the long title was copyright requirements for the use of The Beatles' songs.\nIt reached number 1 in the Netherlands on February 21, 1981; number 2 in the UK in April 1981; and number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on June 20, 1981. In the US, the single also peaked at number 18 on the dance chart. In the US, the song's one-week stay at the top of the Hot 100 interrupted the Kim Carnes single \"Bette Davis Eyes\" run as the number 1 single at five weeks. The next week, Carnes' song regained its number 1 status for an additional four weeks.\nThe origin of the single was the Netherlands where numerous bootleg disco singles were floating around.

It was written by Dawn Richard of the group, as well as Mario Winans and Canadian rapper Drake, the latter of whom featured on the song. Sean Garrett and his production group, Team S. Dot, receive writing and production credits, as does Miykal Snoddy. The song was released as the album's second single in the United States on September 21, 2010.\nAccording to Diddy, the song is about loving someone so much that you forget about yourself It is a R&B tune, which integrates usage of electronica and hip-hop influences, while having a melodic, piano-laden background. The song's official remix features American rappers Gucci Mane and Red Cafe, while rapper and producer Jermaine Dupri also recorded a remix to the song. While critics were divided over Diddy's part in the track, most complimented the song's production, Drake's cameo, and Harper and Richard's vocals.\n\"Loving You No More\" peaked at ninety-one on the Billboard Hot 100 on two occasions. Meanwhile, it peaked in the top twenty of both the US R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts. The song's Gil Green-directed accompanying music video shows Diddy, accompanied by Richard and Kalenna Harper, reminiscing on a past love in a mansion, and in a club scene with Drake. The group performed the song on BET's 106 & Park, during promotion of the album.\n\"Loving You No More\" first leaked under the title \"Hurt\" on November 13, 2009. After being announced as the second single from Last Train to Paris on August 26, 2010, the mastered version of the song was leaked. In an interview with MTV News, Diddy explained the meaning behind the song, commenting, \"The concept of the song is about when you love somebody so much that you forget about yourself. You love them more than you love yourself.\" The song's official remix, released on October 22, 2010, features American rappers Gucci Mane and Red Cafe. Producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri also remixed the song with rap vocals from him, which was unveiled on September 29, 2010. The group performed the song on one occasion, during their takeover of 106 & Park to promote the album, on December 16, 2010.\nThe song is a mid-tempo R&B song, with a length of four minutes and six seconds. Including electronica influences, it has a piano-heavy beat, and has been described as \"melodic\". Diddy has lead vocals, with Kalenna Harper and Dawn Richard singing background and having full vocals in numerous parts. Diddy's lines feature the use of the auto-tune effect. The song also integrates hip-hop, featuring a rap cameo by Drake. Ed Easton, Jr. of WNOW-FM summed up the track as \"an emotional track about losing touch with a significant other.\" According to Easton, the song also featured Diddy's signature \"rhythmic talking disguised as singing.\"\n\nSara D. Anderson of AOL Radio Blog said, \"the duo's beautiful voices twist and soar around Drake's supple and soulful vocals\". Although she commented that Drake's voice was \"almost unrecognizable\" on the track, Becky Bain of Idolator noted \"how sweetly he comes off in this sensitive track\". Bain also complimented Drake's part in the song, stating, \"Drizzy kills it in his mellow verse in the middle, his raspy monotone fitting in quite well with the melancholy vibe of the song.\" A writer for Birthplace Magazine said the song was mixed with \"a combination of slick production, strong vocals from Dirty Money songstresses Dawn and Kaleena, a guest appearance by Drake, and hype as only Diddy can deliver\", and called the song and video \"mainstream guilty pleasures we can enjoy\"\nUpon digital release, \"Loving You No More\" debuted on multiple Billboard charts. While debuting at numbers twenty-eight and twenty-one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Rap Songs charts, respectively, it therefore appeared at ninety-one on the Billboard Hot 100. It fell off the Hot 100 the next week, but would go on in the following weeks to peak at number twenty on the R&B chart and seventeen on the rap chart. After the release of Last Train to Paris, the song re-entered the Hot 100 at its original peak, ninety-one.\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Gil Green.

It was written by Stefani and co-written and produced by Tony Kanal, with additional production by Mark \"Spike\" Stent. Interscope Records serviced the song to US contemporary hit radio on May 8, 2007, as the album's third single; elsewhere it was released in June 2007. Described as one of her favorite songs on the album, Stefani began writing the song while pregnant and finished with Kanal, drawing inspiration from Roberta Flack and Billy Idol records.\nA 1980s-inspired mid-tempo synthpop ballad, \"4 in the Morning\" features a light keyboard during its intro through its break, a guitar, synthetic strings and a slick sheen. Lyrically, the song talks about a relationship on the edge, with the protagonist trying to save her love. \"4 in the Morning\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, who noted it as an improvement over her last singles, while praising its tempo and highlighting her vocals.\n\"4 in the Morning\" failed to replicate the commercial success of previous singles in the United States, peaking at number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was moderately successful elsewhere, peaking within the top-ten in Australia and New Zealand, and the top 20 in several European countries. Its accompanying music video was directed by Stefani's longtime collaborator Sophie Muller, and features Stefani lying in bed and walking around her apartment while performing the song in a melancholic mood. The song was performed during The Sweet Escape Tour and in some concerts Stefani made during 2015.\nStefani began working with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal for her second solo studio album just after finishing the Harajuku Lovers Tour in late 2005, referring to him as her \"comfort zone.\" The two wrote \"4 in the Morning\" based on a tape of melodies left from working on Stefani's debut album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). In a webisode detailing the recording process of the album, Stefani stated that she was inspired by ballads such as Roberta Flack's \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\" and Billy Idol's \"Eyes Without a Face\", as she wanted a \"nice ballad\" on the record. It was one of the last songs recorded for the album, with Stefani citing it as one of her favorite songs on The Sweet Escape, because it \"brings pleasure to [her] ears.\" The song was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on May 8, 2007 as the album's third single. A CD single, containing the album version, two remixes and its music video, was released elsewhere on June 22, 2007.\n\"4 in the Morning\" was written by Stefani and Kanal, who was also responsible for its production, while Mark \"Spike\" Stent provided additional production. Described as a 1980s-inspired mid-tempo synthpop ballad, the track's instrumentation includes a \"light\" keyboard, which \"runs tie the song together from intro through break\", a guitar, synthetic strings and a slick sheen. \"4 in the Morning\" has a mid-tempo beat, which according to some critics is \"perfect for a slow dance\". Stefani's vocals throughout the song's chorus presents a \"fast-talking\" approach. Lyrically, \"4 in the Morning\" talks about transparency in a romantic relationship, with the protagonist pleading for a lover to make up his mind. Bill Lamb of About.com added that the song also deals with a relationship on the edge, which can be seen in the lines: \"I'm lying here in the dark, I'm watching you sleep, it hurts a lot.\" In the chorus, she sings: \"I give you everything that I am/I'm handing over everything that I've got/'cause I wanna have a really true love.\"\n\"4 in the Morning\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called it \"coolly sensual\", noting that \"those celebrations of cool synths and stylish pop hooks that work the best for Stefani.\" Billboard editor Chuck Taylor called it \"a melodic retro ballad that could have come from 1983's Flashdance soundtrack\", praising the track for \"pay[ing] homage to a time when hooks were more meaningful than aligning with hostage-taking producers.\" Gary Graff of the same publication wrote that \"Stefani's Madonna reverence remains intact\" on the song, with J. Freedom du Lac from The Washington Post agreeing, noting a \"Madonnaism\" on the track. Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic also thought that the song \"recalls a 'Crazy for You'-era"

Initially released as a promotional single, it became the record's third and final single on May 23, 2016, when it was sent to hot adult contemporary radio. Stefani co-wrote the song with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson, with the latter two serving as the producers. An electropop song, \"Misery\" uses digital hand clapping and an upbeat samba to produce a futuristic-sounding melody. The lyrics describe a lover who has recently started a relationship and is confused over what to think about it. Several critics drew comparisons between these lyrics to Stefani's personal and romantic life with her boyfriend, Blake Shelton.\n\"Misery\" received a mixed response from contemporary music critics. Generally, some reviewers found the track to be a standout track among those on This Is What the Truth Feels Like for sounding \"effortless\", while others claimed that it was not on a par with Stefani's previously released material. In the United States, it missed entering the Billboard Hot 100, and instead debuted and peaked at number eleven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 extension chart. Elsewhere, it peaked in the lower regions of charts in Australia, France, Scotland, and the United Kingdom. A remix EP featuring three different remixes of the song was made available as a digital download on June 24, 2016.\nTwo accompanying music videos were created for \"Misery\": The former featured hand drawn illustrations and was directed by Zack Sekuler, while the latter live-action version was directed by the singer's long-time collaborator Sophie Muller. It was filmed at the vacated Sears, Roebuck & Company Mail Order Building in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, and features Stefani performing the song while she wears various outfits in the abandoned premises. The video was well-received, especially for Stefani's multiple costume changes. Makeup artist Gregory Arlt and hairstylist Danilo won the Best Hair & Make Up award at the 2016 Ibiza Music Video Awards for their contributions to the video. The singer performed \"Misery\" live on various occasions, including on television and during her This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour in 2016.\nImmediately following the completion of \"Make Me Like You\", Stefani wrote \"Misery\" with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson; however, unlike the recording sessions for her previous albums, the songwriting process was significantly shorter, which she opined was because everything should be simple. \"Misery\" was recorded by Mattias Larsson and Robin Frediksson of Mattman & Robin at Wolf Cousins Studios and Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California. Additional recording was handled by Juan Carlos Torrado and Noah Passovoy, while Serban Ghenea mixed the audio at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\nIn November 2015, Stefani reported \"Misery\" was the second single from her third studio album This Is What the Truth Feels Like (2016); however, \"Make Me Like You\" was released instead. The singer revealed via Twitter that it would actually be serviced as a \"buzz\" single, followed by her teasing a ten-second snippet of the finalized recording. Interscope Records released the song for digital consumption on March 11, 2016, before it was released to hot adult contemporary radio on May 23, 2016, as the album's third single. On April 22 of the same year, Interscope issued a digital EP and included three remixes of \"Misery\" created by disc jockeys Lincoln Jesser, Steven Redant, and Division 4 accompanied by Matt Consola.\n\"Misery\" is an electropop song that lasts three minutes and twenty-six seconds. The upbeat composition is accompanied by a samba and heavy percussion, which was compared to the material on No Doubt's 2012 studio album, Push and Shove, by Sarah Grant from Rolling Stone.

It was released on 15 January 2008 as the second single from her second North American studio album of the same title (2008). Bedingfield co-wrote the song together with American songwriter Danielle Brisebois and American musician and songwriter John Shanks; Shanks also produced the track as well as performing on most of the instruments present. Epic Records serviced the song to contemporary hit radios in the United States on 11 February 2008. It was not released in Europe until April 2011, when it was released as the lead single from her third European studio album Strip Me Away (2011).\nBedingfield noted \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" as her favourite, stating that it centers on escaping from one's troubles. It adapts dance-pop and adult contemporary styles, differing from her previous recordings. Lyrically, the song discusses escapism and finding a peaceful place in difficult situations. The message is amplified by the melancholic tone of the lyrics mixing with the exuberance displayed in Bedingfield's voice. \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" was well received by contemporary music critics; the majority of them named it as one of the album's highlights. Several critics also praised it as a bright and lively summer tune.\n\"Pocketful of Sunshine\" experienced commercial success in North America. In the United States, it peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling three million downloads and becoming her most successful single there. In Canada, it peaked at number three on Canadian Hot 100 and was certified platinum by Music Canada. It, however, did not replicate the success internationally as it charted moderately in several countries.\nThe music video for \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" premiered on 15 April 2008, and features Bedingfield escaping from a stressful situation and dancing on a roof with other background dancers, also portraying scenes of other people escaping their troubles, coming to Bedingfield for comfort. The single has been used widely in the media, being featured in movies and television series such as Easy A, Degrassi: The Next Generation and The Ugly Truth.\n\"Pocketful of Sunshine\" was written and produced by John Shanks, while additional writing was provided by Bedingfield and Danielle Brisebois. The aforementioned songwriters were also involved in performing the background vocals present on the track. Shanks, a musician as well as a writer and producer, performed several instruments that make up the song, which include the guitar, bass and keyboards. The latter instrument was also played by Charlie Judge while Wendy Melvain performed on guitar. Jeff Rothschild was the engineer behind the recording process of \"Pocketful of Sunshine\", which took place at Starstruck Studios in Nashville, Tennessee and Henson Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. He received assistance from engineers Aaron Kasdorf and Jared Robbins in recording the song. Rothschild was involved in programming the song as well as playing the drums. It was then edited through the use of Pro Tools technology by Lars Fox and mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios in Los Angeles, California. In an interview with OK! Magazine, Bedingfield the song as one of her favourites on the album, stating \"Its about going to a familiar place when you're in that situation that you want to escape from finding a peaceful place within.\"\n\"Pocketful of Sunshine\" is the second single taken from Pocketful of Sunshine (2008), a repackaged version of N.B. released in North American territories. Epic Records serviced the song to contemporary hit radios on 11 February 2008. On 29 July 2008, an extended play of \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" was released via iTunes in North American territories. The EP features remixes by StoneBridge and American disc jockey Johnny Vicious. Following the release of Strip Me in international territories in spring 2011, the song was selected to be released as the international single. \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" was released for digital download on 15 April 2011 in Germany and 22 April 2011 in France.\n\"Pocketful of Sunshine\" is a pop song that incorporates styles of dance-pop and runs for three minutes and twenty three seconds."

It was influenced by popular holiday music from Stefani's childhood and marks Stefani and Shelton's second collaboration following their duet \"Go Ahead and Break My Heart\" in 2016. A Christmas track, the song includes country and pop music elements, with lyrics describing a romantic holiday season.\n\"You Make It Feel Like Christmas\" received positive to mixed reviews from music critics. Some believed that the song was successful lyrically and would ultimately become a modern Christmas classic, while other critics found it inferior to the rest of You Make It Feel Like Christmas. In the United States, the song failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100, and instead peaked at number two on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 extension chart. It reached the top 10 of the Adult Contemporary charts for both Canada and the US. In countries such as Germany and Switzerland, it became Stefani's first track to chart in years. On the UK Singles Chart, it served as her first solo top 100 single since 2007 and has sold 66,000 copies by 2019. In 2020, the single was certified Gold by the RIAA in the US.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by long-time Stefani collaborator Sophie Muller and released in November 2018. It features scenes of Stefani and Shelton partaking in various holiday-themed activities interspersed with ones of the two performing the song, accompanied by a big band and children dancers. Stefani's looks in the video were described as reminiscent of American actress Marilyn Monroe. The song has been performed on various television series, such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Late Late Show with James Corden and The Voice, as well as on the 2017 American holiday special Gwen Stefani's You Make It Feel Like Christmas.\nAfter the release of Stefani's third solo album, This Is What the Truth Feels Like (2016), she announced her plans to release new music by the end of 2017 in July of that year. Besides the announcement, she had no further details. Following a nature walk that occurred at Shelton's residential estate in Oklahoma, Stefani felt inspired to write Christmas music and began work on a track that later became \"Christmas Eve\". The material created for You Make It Feel Like Christmas was recorded during the summer months of 2017, after Stefani scheduled joint studio and songwriting sessions with Justin Tranter and busbee. The latter of the three collaborated with Stefani following a suggestion from Shelton that she would work well with him. Stefani was pressured to create a holiday album by busbee that was \"raw and punk and sort of classical at the same time\"; accordingly, Stefani listened to the favorite holiday albums of her childhood, such as Vince Guaraldi's A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) and Emmylou Harris's Light of the Stable (1979), for inspiration.\nOn August 2, 2017, the titles of several unreleased tracks from Stefani, including \"Christmas Eve\", \"My Gift Is You\", \"Under the Christmas Lights\" and \"You Make It Feel Like Christmas\", first leaked onto the internet when they appeared as published works on BMI and GEMA, American and German music databases, respectively. Because of the titles, music critics suggested that Stefani may have been recording a holiday album, due for release in 2017. On September 18 that year, the singer took to her social media accounts and claimed that she \"had something big planned for the holidays\", and would release more information in the near future. The next day, Stefani revealed that she had recorded a Christmas album, confirming its title as You Make It Feel Like Christmas, and stating that the title track would be released as the lead single. It was written by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Shelton and busbee, while production was handled by busbee and Eric Valentine.\n\"You Make It Feel Like Christmas\" was sent"

The song was released digitally in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2012 as the album's third and final single. The dance-pop song was written by Lott in collaboration with its producers Mads Hauge and Phil Thornalley. \"Kiss the Stars\" received mainly negative reviews from contemporary critics who criticised the song's lyrics and close similarities to Katy Perry's \"Firework\" but praised its catchiness and dance-pop rhythms. The song peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe song has been accompanied by a futuristic-themed music video, which was released on 10 January 2012. The video was met with mainly positive reviews. It features Lott dancing alongside CGI robots and dancers, sporting funky hairstyles and outfits that resemble those of American recording artist Madonna. Lott has promoted the single by performing it at the Jingle Bell Ball, The National Lottery and the seventh series of Dancing on Ice.\n\"Kiss the Stars\" was written by Lott in collaboration with the track's producers Mads Hauge and Phil Thornalley. The trio previously worked together on Lott's number-one singles \"Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)\" and \"Boys and Girls\".\n\"Kiss the Stars\" has received mainly negative reviews, being criticised lyrically and for being too similar to the singles released by American singer Katy Perry. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC said that the song is essentially Perry's \"Firework\" (2010). While Ian Gittins of Virgin Media felt that the song \"apes Katy Perry down to its nudge-nudge lyrics: 'When you turn it on, I can go for hours.'\" The song was negatively reviewed by Alex Jackson of The Yorker who called it \"cheesy centric\" and \"a track one may expect at a 5 year-old's birthday party.\"\nThe track received a mixed review from Adam Berry of WhatCulture! who also felt that it evoked a style similar to Katy Perry in addition to the Vengaboys and Freezepop. He went on to criticise the song's \"dreadful\" lyrics but complimented it as \"irritatingly catchy\". Berry also predicted the track to be a \"huge\" success chartswise in the United Kingdom. \"Kiss the Stars\" was deemed as a great song with a catchy chorus and poppy rhythms by Kathryn Black of Pugwash News. Black, however, like other critics, felt that the song \"sounds like a rip-off of Katy Perry's 'Firework'.\"\n\"Kiss the Stars\" debuted at number eighty-one on the UK Singles Chart. The following week the song rose to number fourteen with sales of 18,647 units. In its third week on the chart, it rose to number eight, selling 26,983 units and becoming Lott's fifth top ten hit and ninth consecutive top 20 hit.\n\nThe music video for \"Kiss the Stars\" premiered on Lott's YouTube channel on 10 January 2012. Lott's appearance in the video has been described as a new look for her and an evolution from her previous music videos.\nThe music video features Lott donning a number of different outfits. It opens with Lott sporting a high ponytail, a black top and dark eye make-up. In the following scene, Lott is seen dancing in a tight leotard with leggings and her hair styled poker straight. In another scene, Lott wears a long blonde wig with a blunt fringe and a flowing white dress. She is also seen dancing against a futuristic background, surrounded by CGI dancers that resemble robots. In another scene, Lott kisses one of the robots, the robot then forms itself into an attractive male dancer.\nThe music video has received mainly positive reviews from contemporary critics, most likening Lott's look in it to those of pop singers such as Madonna, Lady Gaga and Kylie Minogue. According to Caroline Westbrook of Metro. Lott's long blonde ponytail and black outfit look is reminiscent of Madonna's style during ger Blond Ambition World Tour (1990). Westbrook also felt that Lott's leotard, straught bob look bears an odd resemblance to Lady Gaga. Capital FM positively reviewed the video, describing it as \"visually exciting\". The video was deemed \"a futuristic visual delight\" by 4music. Radio station In:Demand said that Lott looks \"as radiant as ever\" in the music video.\nShaun Kitchener from the website Entertainmentwise, felt that the music video was \"bizarre\" and criticised Lott for \"upping the cheese factor\" in it. The video received a mixed review from Lina Bastidas of PopDash, who like Kitchener from PopDash's sister website Entertainmentwise, felt that Lott's dance moves were \"cheesy\". Bastidas further criticised the video's \"weird\" settings but"

Initially released as a promotional single, it became the record's third and final single on May 23, 2016, when it was sent to hot adult contemporary radio. Stefani co-wrote the song with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson, with the latter two serving as the producers. An electropop song, \"Misery\" uses digital hand clapping and an upbeat samba to produce a futuristic-sounding melody. The lyrics describe a lover who has recently started a relationship and is confused over what to think about it. Several critics drew comparisons between these lyrics to Stefani's personal and romantic life with her boyfriend, Blake Shelton.\n\"Misery\" received a mixed response from contemporary music critics. Generally, some reviewers found the track to be a standout track among those on This Is What the Truth Feels Like for sounding \"effortless\", while others claimed that it was not on a par with Stefani's previously released material. In the United States, it missed entering the Billboard Hot 100, and instead debuted and peaked at number eleven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 extension chart. Elsewhere, it peaked in the lower regions of charts in Australia, France, Scotland, and the United Kingdom. A remix EP featuring three different remixes of the song was made available as a digital download on June 24, 2016.\nTwo accompanying music videos were created for \"Misery\": The former featured hand drawn illustrations and was directed by Zack Sekuler, while the latter live-action version was directed by the singer's long-time collaborator Sophie Muller. It was filmed at the vacated Sears, Roebuck & Company Mail Order Building in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, and features Stefani performing the song while she wears various outfits in the abandoned premises. The video was well-received, especially for Stefani's multiple costume changes. Makeup artist Gregory Arlt and hairstylist Danilo won the Best Hair & Make Up award at the 2016 Ibiza Music Video Awards for their contributions to the video. The singer performed \"Misery\" live on various occasions, including on television and during her This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour in 2016.\nImmediately following the completion of \"Make Me Like You\", Stefani wrote \"Misery\" with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson; however, unlike the recording sessions for her previous albums, the songwriting process was significantly shorter, which she opined was because everything should be simple. \"Misery\" was recorded by Mattias Larsson and Robin Frediksson of Mattman & Robin at Wolf Cousins Studios and Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California. Additional recording was handled by Juan Carlos Torrado and Noah Passovoy, while Serban Ghenea mixed the audio at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\nIn November 2015, Stefani reported \"Misery\" was the second single from her third studio album This Is What the Truth Feels Like (2016); however, \"Make Me Like You\" was released instead. The singer revealed via Twitter that it would actually be serviced as a \"buzz\" single, followed by her teasing a ten-second snippet of the finalized recording. Interscope Records released the song for digital consumption on March 11, 2016, before it was released to hot adult contemporary radio on May 23, 2016, as the album's third single. On April 22 of the same year, Interscope issued a digital EP and included three remixes of \"Misery\" created by disc jockeys Lincoln Jesser, Steven Redant, and Division 4 accompanied by Matt Consola.\n\"Misery\" is an electropop song that lasts three minutes and twenty-six seconds. The upbeat composition is accompanied by a samba and heavy percussion, which was compared to the material on No Doubt's 2012 studio album, Push and Shove, by Sarah Grant from Rolling Stone.

It was released on June 23, 1987, by Sire Records as the first album single. While shooting for the film, then called Slammer, Madonna had requested Patrick Leonard to develop an uptempo song that captured the nature of her film persona. She later added the lyrics and vocals to the demo tape developed by Leonard, and decided to rename the song as well as the film to \"Who's That Girl\".\nFeaturing instrumentation from drums, bass, and stringed instruments, \"Who's That Girl\" continued Madonna's fascination with Hispanic culture by incorporating Spanish lyrics and using the effect of double vocals. Critical reception was mixed to positive; some critics compared it to Madonna's previous single, \"La Isla Bonita\", while others found it forgettable. \"Who's That Girl\" became Madonna's sixth single to top the Billboard Hot 100, while peaking atop the charts in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium. It was also nominated for \"Best Song Written for Visual Media\" at the 1988 Grammy Awards and \"Best Original Song\" at the 1988 Golden Globe Awards.\nThe music video portrayed a different persona of Madonna, rather than her film character for which it was released. She's seen as a young boyish lady in search of a treasure. Madonna has performed the song on her Who's That Girl (1987) and Rebel Heart (2015\u20132016) tours. The song has been covered by many artists and has appeared in compilations and tribute albums. Despite being a worldwide number-one hit, the song was not included in Madonna's 1990 greatest hits album The Immaculate Collection, but was later included on her 2009 greatest hits album Celebration.\nIn 1986, Madonna was shooting for her third motion picture Who's That Girl, known at the time as Slammer. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had written and produced her third studio album True Blue in 1986. Madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday as Leonard developed the chorus of the song. He handed over that cassette to Madonna, who went to the backroom and finished the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of the song.\nAfter finishing the lyrics, Madonna declared that she wanted the song to be named \"Who's That Girl\" and changed the movie to the same, rather than Slammer, considering it to be a better title. In Fred Bronson's The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits book, Leonard explained that the song was recorded in one day with Madonna adding her vocals only once. Additional instrumental tracks with guitars and percussion were included by Leonard and Bray later. Regarding the development of the music for the film, Madonna further explained\n\"I had some very specific ideas in mind, music that would stand on its own as well as support and enhance what was happening on screen and the only way to make that a reality was to have a hand in writing the tunes myself. [...] The songs aren't necessarily about Nikki [her character name in the movie] or written to be sung by someone like her, but there's a spirit to this music that captures both what the film and the characters are about, I think.\"\nThe song is composed in Madonna's typical style\u2014mingling the drum machine, a bass synth line, and the sound of stringed instruments. The three parts of the song, namely the bridge, where Madonna sings \"what can help me now\", the chorus and the verse flow together strongly. The chorus has a haunting effect in it. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the time signature of common time, with a key of A minor and a medium tempo of 104 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals span from the notes of G\u2083 to B\u2084. The song follows a basic sequence of Am\u2089\u2013G\u2013C\u209b\u1d64\u209b\u2082\u2013Am\u2089\u2013G\u2013Dm as its chord progression.\nThe song epitomizes Madonna's interest with Hispanic culture that continued after the release of \"La Isla Bonita\", by adding Spanish phrases in the chorus and over the trumpets of the second verse, and also by the added instrumental break in the middle. It also uses the sonic effect brought about by the combination of multiple vocal lines, which had been previously used by groups like The Beach Boys in their singles \"God Only Knows\" (1966) and \"I Get Around\" (1964) as well as R.E.M.'s singles \"Fall on Me\" (1986) and \"Near Wild Heaven\" (1991). \"Who's That Girl\" employs this effect on"

It is the title track from her third studio album True Blue (1986), and was released as the album's third single on September 17, 1986, by Sire Records. Written and produced by Madonna and Steve Bray, the song deals with Madonna's feelings for her then-husband Sean Penn. A dance-pop song, it features instrumentation from a rhythm guitar, a synthesizer, keyboards, and drums. The main chorus is backed by an alternate one, incorporating a chord progression generally found in doo-wop music.\nReceived by critics as a light-hearted and cute retro song, \"True Blue\" topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada and became another consecutive top-ten song in United States for Madonna, by reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100. The original music video portrayed her again with a new look, leaner and sporting platinum blond bushy hair. An alternate video was made through the \"Make My Video\" contest on MTV. The final selected videos had a similar theme of a 1950s-inspired setting and the storyline following the lyrics of the song. \"True Blue\" has been performed on the Who's That Girl World Tour (1987) and the Rebel Heart Tour (2015\u20132016).\nWhen Madonna had started working on her third studio album, True Blue in 1985, she was already in a relationship with actor Sean Penn whom she married by the year-end. It was the first album that the singer acted in the role of a record producer and wanted to add her own \"sophistication\" to it. Her optimism assimilated in the songs created, including the title track, which she co-wrote and co-produced the song with Stephen Bray. According to Madonna, \"True Blue\" takes its title from a favorite expression of Penn and to his very pure vision of love. The song and the album was Madonna's \"unabashed valentine\" for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, \"She [Madonna] was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs.\" In 2015, Madonna said that \"True Blue\" is \"a song about true love. I didn't know what I was talking about when I wrote it.\"\n\"True Blue\" is a dance-pop song which was musically inspired by the Motown's girl groups from the 1960s which are considered the direct antecedents of Madonna's musical sound, and the music she had grown up in her hometown Detroit. The song is composed in the key of B major. It is set in compound quadruple meter, commonly used in doo-wop, and has a moderate tempo of 118 beats per minute. \"True Blue\" features instrumentation from a rhythm guitar, a synthesizer, keyboards, and drums for the bassline, with a basic sequence of I\u2013vi\u2013IV\u2013V (B\u2013G\u266fm\u2013E\u2013F\u266f) as its main chord progression.\nMadonna's vocal range spans a bit less than one and a half octaves, from F\u266f\u2083 to B\u2084. The chorus is backed by sounds of bells ringing, an alternate verse\u2014\"This time I know it's true\"\u2014 which is sung by three back-up singers during the interlude, and a bass counter melody which introduces her vocals during the second chorus. The lyrics are constructed in a verse-chorus form, with the theme being Madonna's feelings for Penn; it uses the archaic love word \"dear\" in the line \"Just think back and remember, dear\". According to author Lucy O'Brien, who wrote in her biography Madonna: Like an Icon, the verse-and-chorus composition was reminiscent of The Dixie Cups' 1964 single \"Chapel of Love\", with backup singers Siedah Garrett and Edie Lehman accompanying Madonna's convincing \"girly\" vocals like a choir.\nDavitt Sigerson from Rolling Stone said that the song \"squanders a classic beat and an immensely promising title\", In his book Madonna: An Intimate Biography, journalist J.

It is the title track from her third studio album True Blue (1986), and was released as the album's third single on September 17, 1986, by Sire Records. Written and produced by Madonna and Steve Bray, the song deals with Madonna's feelings for her then-husband Sean Penn. A dance-pop song, it features instrumentation from a rhythm guitar, a synthesizer, keyboards, and drums. The main chorus is backed by an alternate one, incorporating a chord progression generally found in doo-wop music.\nReceived by critics as a light-hearted and cute retro song, \"True Blue\" topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada and became another consecutive top-ten song in United States for Madonna, by reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100. The original music video portrayed her again with a new look, leaner and sporting platinum blond bushy hair. An alternate video was made through the \"Make My Video\" contest on MTV. The final selected videos had a similar theme of a 1950s-inspired setting and the storyline following the lyrics of the song. \"True Blue\" has been performed on the Who's That Girl World Tour (1987) and the Rebel Heart Tour (2015\u20132016).\nWhen Madonna had started working on her third studio album, True Blue in 1985, she was already in a relationship with actor Sean Penn whom she married by the year-end. It was the first album that the singer acted in the role of a record producer and wanted to add her own \"sophistication\" to it. Her optimism assimilated in the songs created, including the title track, which she co-wrote and co-produced the song with Stephen Bray. According to Madonna, \"True Blue\" takes its title from a favorite expression of Penn and to his very pure vision of love. The song and the album was Madonna's \"unabashed valentine\" for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, \"She [Madonna] was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs.\" In 2015, Madonna said that \"True Blue\" is \"a song about true love. I didn't know what I was talking about when I wrote it.\"\n\"True Blue\" is a dance-pop song which was musically inspired by the Motown's girl groups from the 1960s which are considered the direct antecedents of Madonna's musical sound, and the music she had grown up in her hometown Detroit. The song is composed in the key of B major. It is set in compound quadruple meter, commonly used in doo-wop, and has a moderate tempo of 118 beats per minute. \"True Blue\" features instrumentation from a rhythm guitar, a synthesizer, keyboards, and drums for the bassline, with a basic sequence of I\u2013vi\u2013IV\u2013V (B\u2013G\u266fm\u2013E\u2013F\u266f) as its main chord progression.\nMadonna's vocal range spans a bit less than one and a half octaves, from F\u266f\u2083 to B\u2084. The chorus is backed by sounds of bells ringing, an alternate verse\u2014\"This time I know it's true\"\u2014 which is sung by three back-up singers during the interlude, and a bass counter melody which introduces her vocals during the second chorus. The lyrics are constructed in a verse-chorus form, with the theme being Madonna's feelings for Penn; it uses the archaic love word \"dear\" in the line \"Just think back and remember, dear\". According to author Lucy O'Brien, who wrote in her biography Madonna: Like an Icon, the verse-and-chorus composition was reminiscent of The Dixie Cups' 1964 single \"Chapel of Love\", with backup singers Siedah Garrett and Edie Lehman accompanying Madonna's convincing \"girly\" vocals like a choir.\nDavitt Sigerson from Rolling Stone said that the song \"squanders a classic beat and an immensely promising title\", In his book Madonna: An Intimate Biography, journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli described the song as \"the light-hearted, fun track of the whole True Blue album project having a retro 1950's feel to it\".

It was released on April 10, 1985 by Sire Records as the album's third single. Written by Madonna and Steve Bray, it was one of the first songs developed for the project and, according to Madonna, was inspired by a girl who is saved by an angel, and she falls in love with him. \"Angel\" was released as a 12\" single with \"Into the Groove\" in some countries and charted likewise. A music video was planned but was canceled, and a promotional clip comprising segments of her previous videos was released in the United Kingdom.\nMusically \"Angel\" consists of three chord ascending hook, which serves for the verse and chorus. It has vocal harmonies beneath the main chorus and the lyrics repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's saviour. Critical response to the song varied, with some music critics calling it a classic and others deeming it sub-par compared to Madonna's previous singles. \"Angel\" became the singer's fifth consecutive top-five single on the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top of its dance charts. It was also able to reach number-one in Australia and the top-five of the charts in Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. Madonna has performed the song only once, on The Virgin Tour in 1985. The song was used at the soundtrack of the 3rd season of Stranger Things.\n\"Angel\" was written by Madonna and Steve Bray and released worldwide on April 10, 1985. The song first began as a demo and was recorded as early as April 1984 for her second studio album, Like a Virgin. However, the whole project was held off, much to Madonna's frustration, by the continuing sales of her self-titled debut album, which had by then sold over a million copies in United States. She had decided to release \"Angel\" as the initial single from the album, but changed her mind, after the recording of the title track \"Like a Virgin\" was complete. \"Angel\" was an ode to \"a heavenly love\" and inspired from Madonna's Catholic upbringing with the singer saying, \"I think it's important to call angels to you to protect you... That's part of the ritualistic moment. The calling of angels.\" The track was ultimately released as the third single, and included the song \"Into the Groove\", from Madonna's 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan, on the B-side of the 12-inch maxi-single.\nMadonna had initially planned to release a music video for \"Angel\", but later decided to go against it, as at that time, there were already five Madonna music videos on-rotation in the music channels and were being broadcast continuously. Hence, Warner Bros. and Madonna felt that adding another video to the already saturated channels, might not be in her favour. A promotional video, containing scenes from the music videos of \"Burning Up\", \"Borderline\", \"Lucky Star\", \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Material Girl\" was made by Warner Bros. Records and aired in the United Kingdom. The video was included on the promotional-only video compilations It's That Girl and She's Breathless.\n\"Angel\" begins with a laugh and an echo, panning from left to the right. The song is built on an ascending hook consisting of three chord sequence, which serves for the verse and chorus. It consists of a constant 8th rhythm throughout the song, making it sound similar to the songs of the band Machine. Vocal harmonies are also added beneath the main chorus. It is a two-bar phrase song, and laughter is again added as the song slowly fades out. Madonna sings in her lower register at the beginning, and shifts to the higher one in the line \"I can see it in your e-e-e-eyye-e-s\". The line was taken from the song \"Death Disco\" (1979), by the British musical group Public Image Ltd. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by Alfred Publishing, the song is set in common time, with a medium tempo of 133 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major, with Madonna's voice spanning from the  low-note of G\u266f\u2083 to the high-note of B\u266d\u2084. The song has a basic sequence of Am7\u2013Bm7\u2013Cmaj7 as its chord progression. The lyrics continuously repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's savior.\nRikky Rooksby, author of Madonna: The Complete Guide to Her Music, commented that \"Angel\" is a song \"that is less than even the sum of its parts\".

It was released as the album's second single on August 25, 1987, by Sire Records. Its Silver Screen Single Mix later appeared on the EP The Holiday Collection (1991). Written and produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray, the song was inspired by her relationship with then-husband Sean Penn, and his abusive and violent nature. Containing a dance-oriented, up-tempo groove, the song begins with the chorus and is accompanied by a four-note descending bassline and staccato chords in the verses.\nSince its release, \"Causing a Commotion\" has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. The song was a commercial success, peaking within the top-ten in the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and topped the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. Madonna performed the song on the Who's That Girl World Tour in 1987\u00a0\u2013 which was transmitted via satellite to the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards\u00a0\u2013 and the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990. The performances were included in the home video release of the tours.\nIn 1986, Madonna was shooting for her third motion picture Who's That Girl, known at the time as Slammer. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, with whom she had written and produced her third studio album True Blue (1986). The song was written and produced by Madonna and Bray for the film's soundtrack. It was inspired by her then husband Sean Penn and their often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn was on the verge of breaking up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. That translated as the inspiration behind the song. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life,\n\"I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit them [the paparazzi] many times. I never would, you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse.\"\nIn the United States, \"Causing a Commotion\" was released on August 25, 1987. In the United Kingdom, the song was released on September 17, just after the conclusion of the Who's That Girl World Tour that same month. In 1991, the Silver Screen Single Mix of the song was included on the EP The Holiday Collection (1991).\n\"Causing a Commotion\" was recorded and mixed by Stephen Bray along with Shep Pettibone, who also did additional production on the track. Junior Vasquez was the mixing engineer along with Steve Peck, the former also did the audio editing. Background vocals were provided by Donna De Lory and Niki Haris. \"Causing a Commotion\" has a dancey, up-tempo groove in it. The musical arrangement consists of a number of hooks interpolating with each other. It begins with the chorus, where Madonna sings the line \"I've got the moves baby, You've got the motion, If we got together we'd be causing a commotion\". The verses are accompanied by a four-note descending bassline and interjecting staccato chords.\nThe lyrics make reference to Madonna's 1985 hit single \"Into the Groove\" and have three parts to the vocal harmony. Andrzej Ciuk, one of the editors of the book Exploring Space noted that the proverbial status of the phrase \"opposites attract\" as a defining key ingredient of cultural concept of \"love\" and this was evident also in the song with the lyrics: \"You met your match when you met me, I know that you'll disagree it's crazy, But opposites attract you'll see, And I won't let you get away so easy\".\n\"Causing a Commotion\" received generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, said that the song was \"Perfectly acceptable, though not in the same class as 'Who's That Girl'.\" Christian Wright from Spin called the song celebratory. Camille Paglia, one of the authors of The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, said that Madonna's command of massive, resonant basslines impressed her. She wrote: \"I recall my stunned admiration as I sat in the theater in 1987 and first experienced the crashing, descending chords of Madonna's 'Causing a Commotion', which opened her dreadful movie Who's That Girl.

It was released on January 3, 2020, along with a lyric video through Def Jam Recordings, as the lead single from his fifth studio album, Changes. The song is Bieber's first single as a solo artist to be released in almost four years, following his March 2016 single, \"Company\", a song from his 2015 album Purpose. Bieber joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok on the day of the song's release.\n\"Yummy\" received mixed reviews from music critics, some of whom complimented on Bieber's vocal performance while others criticized the song's production, its songwriting, and Bieber's delivery. The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, while reaching the top five in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and various other countries, and hitting number one in New Zealand. The song's official music video was released on January 4, 2020.\nThe song was first teased by Bieber on October 27, 2019, when he took to Instagram to tease the title of the song by drawing it on a piece of paper. The song's genre which he dubbed \u201cR&BIEBER\u201d was also teased on the following day with another post uploaded onto his Instagram account.\nOn December 23, 2019, Bieber teased the release by posting a picture of himself in front of a piano accompanied by two posts with the caption \"tomorrow\". The following day, he announced the single via a trailer he uploaded to YouTube that shows him walking through an abandoned gas station. The trailer also serves as an announcement for his upcoming North American tour starting May 14, 2020, as well as a documentary covering \"all different stories\". About the upcoming music, Bieber stated that \"I believe that I am right where I\u2019m supposed to be and God has me right where he wants me\", and that he feels like \"this is different than the previous albums just because of where I'm at in my life\".\nOn the release day of \"Yummy\", Bieber joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok and posted a video of himself lip-syncing to the song, and encouraged his fans to do so, as well. Four days later, Bieber released autographed limited editions of \"Yummy\", including a cassette, a seven-inch picture disc, six unique CDs and five unique seven-inch vinyl discs, available for only 24 hours. Bieber released five additional music videos for the song, titled: \"Animated Version\", \"x drew house, Animated Version\", \"Beliebers React\", \"Fan Lip Sync\" and \"Food Fight\", and \"TikTok Compilation Video\" and launched an official \"Yummy\" online game.\n\"Yummy\" is a \"straightforward R&B number\" that moves along on pop-trap beats. Bieber's vocals span from F\u2084 to the high B\u266d\u2085. The song contains a \"crisp bass line and plinking keyboards\". Bieber rap-sings the pre-chorus, while he hits his \"signature falsetto\" in the bridge. Bryan Rolli of Forbes magazine called the chorus \"seductive\", albeit \"meaningless\". The song is considered an ode to Bieber's wife, Hailey Bieber.\n\"Yummy\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Rania Aniftos of Billboard magazine said \"Yummy\" brings back \"the flirtatious Bieber we've missed and been waiting for\", describing the chorus as \"catchy\". Bryan Rolli, writing for Forbes, said that Bieber \"sings his heart out\" on the song and noted although \"the lyrics may not invite scholarly analysis ... Bieber sure does sound good singing them\". Rolli concluded calling the song a \"win, an inevitable chart smash\" and opined that it is \"sure to sound even better when 50,000 fans scream it every night on his upcoming tour\". In a later review, Rolli called the song \"mediocre\" which \"lacks the components of a smash hit.\" Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times described the song as \"a lithe little R&B number that faintly recalls Ginuwine's mid-'90s classic 'Pony' and basically three-and-a-half minutes of PG-13 sex talk seemingly directed at Hailey Baldwin\". He stated that \"though it's very cute, 'Yummy' feels awfully lightweight for a single that has as much hanging on it as this one does\" and added that the song \"loses much of its flavor after only a few spins\". Brad Callas of Complex magazine listed \"Yummy\" amongst the best new music of the week and said Bieber's \"pivot back to R&B is refreshing for those who were fans of his slept-on 2013 project,\u00a0Journals\". Callas further remarked that the \"silky vocals\" is at times reminiscent of Bieber's 2016 collaboration with Post Malone, \"Deja Vu\". NME's Sam Moore complimented the song's R&B production, but dismissed the lyrics,"

The song was inspired by a newspaper article Vedder read about Jeremy Wade Delle, a high school student who shot himself in front of his English class on January 8, 1991. It reached the number five spot on both the Mainstream and Modern Rock Billboard charts. It did not originally chart on the regular Billboard Hot 100 singles chart since it was not released as a commercial single in the US at the time, but a re-release in July 1995 brought it up to number 79.\nThe song gained popularity for its music video, directed by Mark Pellington and released in 1992, which received heavy rotation by MTV and became a hit. The original music video for \"Jeremy\" was directed and produced by Chris Cuffaro. Epic Records and MTV later rejected the music video, and released the version directed by Pellington instead.  In 1993, the \"Jeremy\" video was awarded four MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Video of the Year.\n\"Jeremy\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by bassist Jeff Ament. The song's music was written before the band went out on tour in support of Alice in Chains in February 1991.\nAment on the song:\nI already had two pieces of music that I wrote on acoustic guitar...with the idea that I would play them on a Hamer 12-string bass I had just ordered. When the bass arrived, one of [the pieces] became \"Jeremy\"...I had an idea for the outro when we were recording it the second time...I overdubbed a twelve-string bass, and we added a cello. That was big-time production, for us....Rick [Parashar]\u2019s a supertalented engineer-musician...Stone [Gossard, Pearl Jam\u2019s rhythm guitarist] was sick one day, and Ed, Rick and I conjured up the art piece that opens and closes the song. That was so fun\u2014I wanted to make a whole record like that.\nIn another interview, Ament stated:\nWe knew it was a good song, but it was tough getting it to feel right\u2014for the chorus to sit back and the outro to push over the top. The tune went from practically not making it on the record to being one of the best takes. I'm not sure if it's the best song on the album but I think it's the best take. On \"Jeremy\" I always heard this other melody in the choruses and the end, and it never sounded good on guitar or bass. So we brought in a cello player which inspired a background vocal, and those things made the song really happen. Most of the time if something doesn't work right away, I just say fuck it\u2014but this was an instance when perseverance paid off.\n\"Jeremy\" is based on two different true stories. The song takes its main inspiration from a newspaper article about a 15-year-old boy named Jeremy Wade Delle from Richardson, Texas, who shot himself in front of his teacher and his second period English class of 30 students on the morning of January 8, 1991. In a 2009 interview, Vedder said that he felt \"the need to take that small article and make something of it\u2014to give that action, to give it reaction, to give it more importance.\"\nDelle was described by schoolmates as \"real quiet\" and known for \"acting sad\". After coming into class late that morning, Delle was told to get an admittance slip from the school office. He left the classroom, and returned with a .357 Magnum revolver. Delle walked to the front of the classroom, announced \"Miss, I got what I really went for\", put the barrel of the firearm in his mouth, and pulled the trigger before his teacher or classmates could react. Lisa Moore, a schoolmate, knew Jeremy from the in-school suspension program: \"He and I would pass notes back and forth and he would talk about life and stuff,\" she said. \"He signed all of his notes, 'Write back.' But on Monday he wrote, 'Later days.' I didn't know what to make of it. But I never thought this would happen.\"\nWhen asked about the song, Vedder explained:\nIt came from a small paragraph in a paper which means you kill yourself and you make a big old sacrifice and try to get your revenge. That all you're gonna end up with is a paragraph in a newspaper. Sixty-four degrees and cloudy in a suburban neighborhood. That's the beginning of the video and that's the same thing in the end; it does nothing \u2026 nothing changes. The world goes on and you're gone. The best revenge"

The song was written by Bieber, Michael Pollack, Raul Cubina, and producers Andrew Watt, Jon Bellion and The Monsters & Strangerz.\nBieber revealed on April 10, 2020, during an Instagram Live that he had recorded a song called \"Anyone\". On December 30, 2020, Bieber announced on Twitter that the song would be released on January 1, 2021. He revealed the cover art and a 15-second trailer of the song's accompanying music video the following day.\nBieber performed his first full concert since 2017, which included the debut performance of \"Anyone\". Speaking of the song, Bieber said: \"'Anyone' is such a special, hopeful, anthemic song. It sets the tone for a brighter new year full of hope and possibility\".\n\"Anyone\" is a 1980s and 1990s-inspired synth-pop power ballad with a rhythmic pulse. The song is three minutes and 10 seconds in length.\n\"Anyone\" debuted at its peak of number two on the Canadian Hot 100 issued for January\u00a016, 2021. Music Canada certified the song Double Platinum. On the US Billboard Hot 100, it debuted and peaked at number six; it earned a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which denotes 500,000 units based on sales and track-equivalent on-demand streams. \"Anyone\" entered at number four on the UK Singles Chart, and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it Silver. In Australia, the song debuted at number five and went Platinum.

It was directed by American music video director and film maker Colin Tilley and stars American actress Zoey Deutch who plays Bieber's love interest in the video. Bieber portrays a 1940s boxer whose powerful love for his other half inspires him to train, fight, and eventually overcome a potential K.O. on his journey to becoming a champion. For the music video, Bieber covered up all of his tattoos.\nCredits adapted from YouTube.\nColin Tilley \u2013 direction\nJames Ranta \u2013 production\nWhitney Jackson \u2013 production\nElias Talbot \u2013 photography direction\nVinnie Hobbs \u2013 editing\nSB Projects \u2013 management\nBieber performed the song for the first time during his New Year's Eve concert on December 31, 2020. He later performed the song on March 13, 2021, during the 2021 Kids' Choice Awards. In May 2, he performed the song on Big Brother Brasil 21.\nIn February 2021, American music professional Rick Beato compared \"Anyone\" to \"Goin' Home\" (1998), a song by American rock band Toto. He expressed his opinion that the choruses of the songs are written in the same key, and the melody and tempo are almost the same. Canadian radio station CKDR-FM expressed a similar opinion. American guitarist and Toto's founding member Steve Lukather accused Bieber of stealing \"Goin' Home\" in a May 2021 interview.\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nJustin Bieber \u2013 lead vocals, songwriting, background vocals\nAndrew Watt \u2013 production, songwriting, background vocals, drums, guitar, keyboards\nJon Bellion \u2013 production, songwriting, background vocals, bass, drums, programming\nThe Monsters & Strangerz \u2013 production, keyboards, programming\nAlexander Izquierdo \u2013 songwriting, background vocals\nJordan K.

The singer co-wrote the song with Justin Tranter, Kennedi Lykken, Mattias Larsson, Robin Fredriksson and Tom Holkenborg, while the production was handled by Mattman & Robin. Holkenborg also composed the soundtrack and orchestrations he created for it are used in the song. Announced in December 2018, the song was released for digital download and streaming on 24 January 2019 through Warner Bros. Records as the soundtrack's lead single.\n\"Swan Song\" is an electropop song set to muted electronics, cinematic horns and orchestral stabs. In the song, Lipa references 1980s AIDS activist group ACT UP and sings about new beginnings and society using their voices to fight for what they believe in. Several critics praised the song for the production. It was nominated for Best Original Song at the 24th Satellite Awards. Commercially, the song reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart and also reached the top 50 of charts in Belgium (Flanders), Ireland, Lithuania and Scotland. The song was awarded a gold certification in Poland from the Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry (ZPAV).\nThe music video for \"Swan Song\" was directed by Floria Sigismondi and accompanied the song's release. A blockbuster visual, it follows a loose synopsis of Alita: Battle Angel, specifically with the self-discovery themes. The video features Lipa and her crew in the fictional Iron City of the film. They encounter a giant robot and eventually Alita, before Lipa transforms into her towards the end. Several critics complimented the video's sci-fi themes. An acoustic version and a remixes extended play were released for further promotion.\nAt the end of 2018, Dua Lipa was contacted about an opportunity to create a song for the new film Alita: Battle Angel, which James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez had been working on. She accepted as she was instantly drawn to the film's titular character, Alita, and wanted to be a part of the film. The film team thought that Lipa would be a perfect fit for Alita: Battle Angel after seeing her music video for \"New Rules\". They thought her performance had the \"kick-ass strength, power and attitude\" Alita embodies in the film. Lipa was given the film's trailer and synopsis to begin, while she later got to see it prior to working on the song. Lipa wrote the song alongside Justin Tranter, Kennedi Lykken, Mattias Larsson, Robin Fredriksson and Tom Holkenborg. The singer found it exciting to write a song she already had a concept for and experiment with sounds that were different from what she was working on with her album. Holkenborg had composed the score for the film; the writers decided to take the orchestrations he created and use them in the song. The production was handled by Mattman & Robin.\nMusically, \"Swan Song\" is an electropop track. It is constructed in verse\u2013chorus form and composed in the time signature of  time in the key of C minor, with a tempo of 96 beats per minute and a chord progression of A\u266d\u2013B\u266d\u2013Cm\u2013Gm7. The song begins with a burst of horns and heavy drums. The production features muted electronics, airy synths, stabbing brass samples, vocal chants, percolating percussion, cinematic horns, orchestral stabs, a driving melody, powerful strings and a mechanized, cybernetic and pulsating beat. Lipa builds on an urgency feeling in the bridge. The synths build up to the minimal chorus, while the sections progress to the final booming hook.\nLipa uses triumphant vocals, ranging from G\u2083 to D\u2085. In the song, Lipa sings about new beginnings and mentions a series of obstacles she has had to overcome. The writers were inspired by how Alita fights for the lives of marginalized people. They wrote the song about how society constantly needs to speak up about what they believe in and the injustices of the world, as well as how their voices always need to be used; this message was also inspired by the film's empowering message. The song additionally took inspiration from the 1980s advocacy group ACT UP, who formed in response to the HIV/AIDS crisis at the time. The bridge paraphrases the group's motto \"silence equals death\" and the song's title"

Alaina co-wrote the song with Jesse Frasure and Meghan Trainor. It was released to country radio through Mercury Nashville and Interscope Records on June 27, 2016, as the EP's second single and officially impacted the format on July 11, 2016. The song is also included on her second studio album of the same name (2017), and serves as the record's second single.\nThe country rock song explores the concept of staying true to one's self despite insecurities and external pressures. Upon release, the song was praised by critics for its \"anthemic\" nature as well as Alaina's confidence. \"Road Less Traveled\" debuted at number 57 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, and has since become Alaina's first number one single. It also charted at numbers 8 and 67 on both the Hot Country Songs and Hot 100 charts respectively. The song has sold 203,000 copies in the United States as of May 2017. It also charted in Canada, reaching number 3 on the Canada Country chart.\nAn accompanying music video for the song was directed by Chris Hicky.\nThe song won Alaina a CMT Award for Breakthrough Video of the Year in 2017.\n\"Road Less Traveled\" was written in 2013 by Lauren Alaina, Jesse Frasure and Meghan Trainor in Nashville, Tennessee. At the time, Alaina was dealing with the divorce of her parents, bulimia and her father going to rehab for alcoholism. She wanted to write an uplifting song that could inspire others going through similar struggles. Trainor was also experiencing insecurities about her figure at the time, telling Billboard in 2014 that she wanted to tell herself and others to \"love yourself more\". A discussion involving the Robert Frost poem \"The Road Not Taken\" led the co-writers to land on \"Road Less Traveled\" as their title. They then wrote the chorus and the hook, \"take the road less traveled on,\" first, which is extremely similar to Berlin's \"Take My Breath Away.\"\nThe demo was recorded using entirely programmed instrumentation. Busbee, who serves as the record's producer, sought to blend the synthesized instruments with authentic ones to create a soundscape that is radio-friendly but in tune with the song's message. Vocals were recorded in the summer of 2014. Alaina underwent vocal surgery on August 12, 2014 and re-recorded the lead vocals on the song after her recovery. Her vocal range expanded after her surgery with Alaina hitting a big note during the song's bridge that she struggled to reach prior.\n\"Road Less Traveled\" is a country rock song which runs for a duration of three minutes and thirty-six seconds. It begins with a banjo played in a \"pinging\" lick accompanied by hand clapping and an \"insistent\" kick drum. Musically, the track follows a \"four-on-the-floor\" beat accentuated by two banjos and a mandolin \"twisting\" around a \"spacey\" synth line. Producer busbee aimed to blend authentic instrumentation with synthetic sounds for a blend of country and pop styles.\nLyrically, the song is about \"feeling good in your own skin\" and speaks to a journey of self-acceptance. The titular lyrics were inspired by the popular Robert Frost poem, \"The Road Not Taken\", in which the narrator chooses a \"road less traveled\" at a fork in the road. Self-image is addressed in the first verse with references to dress sizes and Alaina imploring the listener not to \"let the world decide what's beautiful,\" alluding to Alaina's own previous struggles with body image. Other lyrics emphasize the importance of staying true to yourself, or \"march[ing] to the rhythm of a different drum\" and \"just own[ing] it\". Critics have labelled the song an \"anthem\" for its empowering message comparing it to Martina McBride's \"This One's for the Girls\" and co-writer Meghan Trainor's \"All About That Bass\".\nBilly Dukes of Taste of Country wrote that Alaina \"has never sounded more confident\" in his \"Critic's Pick\" review of the single. In particular, Dukes praised the singer's approach to the \"anthemic\" and \"uplifting\" message. In a review of the EP, Jason Scott of PopDust complimented the \"undeniable\" songwriting on \"Road Less Traveled\" and deemed the track \"one of her most alluring performances ever\".\n\"Road Less Traveled\" debuted at number 57 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart dated September 3, 2016. The following week, the song experienced a significant gain in airplay and audience, due in part to Alaina's selection as the iHeartRadio \"On the Verge\" artist, which guarantees airplay on the"

It is the third single from Underwood's second studio album, Carnival Ride. It was released in the United States on April 7, 2008, by which point the song had already charted. At the 51st Grammy Awards, the song won Underwood her third consecutive Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. It has sold 1,300,000 copies to date.\nThe song is one of four tracks on the album co-written by Underwood, and the third consecutive one to be released as a single from the album.\nThe song is a moderate up-tempo describing a woman meeting a man at a club and later eloping with him in Las Vegas after having had too much to drink that night. She wakes up the next morning, \"thinkin' 'bout Elvis somewhere in Vegas\", to discover that she does not even know her last name (i.e., she married the man while she was intoxicated), and worries that her \"mama would be so ashamed.\" The music video portrays the song as a prequel to her \"Before He Cheats\" song, even going so far as to hire the same actor to play the man in question.\nThe single was generally met with mixed reviews.\nAllmusic picked the song as a \"track pick\", calling the song \"Miranda Lambert filtered through Shania Twain\", and dubbed it a \"one night stand anthem.\" Rolling Stone picked the track as their favorite, saying \"the most fun is \"Last Name,\" where she gets wasted and runs off to Vegas with a guy she doesn't know.\" Blender awarded the song four out of five stars, describing the song as the \"most irresponsible (and fun) moment on the new album involves one wild night, one too many shots of Cuervo and one unexpected ring.\" Billboard gave a positive review of the track, praising the lyrics: \"It's a cleverly penned lyric that hilariously celebrates drunken debauchery\" as well as summing it up as \"a performance that combines soulful vocals, edgy intensity and sassy attitude into a delicious cocktail.\"\nHowever, it also received some negative reviews: Engine 145 gave the song a 'thumbs down', describing the song as a \"straight-laced performance\" that just \"places the focus on the vocal\". Slant Magazine labelled the single as a \"bald-faced attempt at recreating the 'Before He Cheats' phenomenon\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwood performed the song live for the first time on television during the 43rd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards on May 18, 2008. She performed the song live at the seventh season finale of American Idol on May 21, 2008. She performed the song at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009.\nThe song is described in the video as what happened before the \"Before He Cheats\" video.\nThe video starts with some segments from \"Before He Cheats\" and then goes into a scene three months earlier (\"before he cheated\", it says) with her in the club drinking with her friends. The same man from the \"Before He Cheats\" spots her and asks her for a dance. From this point on, while the guy is with Underwood, he is flirting with every other woman he sees. After the dance, Underwood leaves with the guy in his car with fuzzy dice in the rear view mirror. They make it out to Las Vegas where they participate in a couple of gambling activities such as roulette and a Wheel of Fortune game where they win a new truck. Later they get married in a chapel with an Elvis impersonator officiating. They run off in his new pickup truck (the one used in \"Before He Cheats\") and the video ends with a spark from the chapel sign lights.\nThe song debuted at number 46 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, nearly a month before the single's official release. For the week of June 21, 2008 it rose from number five to number one, to become her fifth straight number one on the Billboard chart, her seventh straight number one country single, and her eighth number one Billboard single overall. This marked Underwood as the first solo female artist to have five consecutive number one's on the country survey in almost 20 years, since Rosanne Cash had a string of six number one titles between 1987 and 1989. It is the third country number one from Carnival Ride and reached the top of the chart faster than the first two singles, taking only 13 weeks. \"Last Name\" has sold 1,300,000 downloads as of November 2015.\nOn the Hot 100 the song reached number 19, making it Underwood's fifth top 20 Hot 100 hit, and the second from Carnival Ride.\n\n\n\nKristin Chenoweth performed a cover of the song"

It was released in March 2009 as the second single from his 2009 album Defying Gravity. The song reached number three on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The song also became his highest peak on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 16, and his only top 20 on that chart to date. Urban co-wrote this song with Monty Powell.\nAlong with eventual Idol winner Kris Allen, Urban performed the song live during the finale of the eighth season of American Idol on 20 May 2009.\n\"Kiss a Girl\" is a moderate up-tempo song in which the male narrator expresses a desire to fall in love with a female.\nThom Jurek of AllMusic cited \"Kiss a Girl\" as a standout track on the album, calling it a \"tight little rocker\". He said that it and \"Sweet Thing\", the album's first single, \"are 21st century equivalents of rock & roll love songs.\" Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine described the song unfavorably, saying that it was a retread of his previous single \"Sweet Thing\", which itself was described as a retread of Urban's earlier material.\nBoth a finalised and a promotional music video for \"Kiss a Girl\" are available for view on CMT and were both directed by Chris Hicky.\nThe promotional video for the song premiered in April 2009 on CMT's website. It consists of Urban and his band performing in front of a green screen. Some of these scenes were later edited and included the TV video.\nThe official video was found on iTunes on 25 May 2009. It consists of Urban and the band performing in an animated city. Also included is two people who eventually find each other and fall in love.

Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard, \"Even Flow\" was released in 1992 as the second single from the band's debut album, Ten (1991). The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003). A remixed version of the song was included on the 2009 Ten reissue.\n\"Even Flow\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, \"I knew it was a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it.\" Drummer Dave Krusen said, \"I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation.\" He added that \"it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better.\" Guitarist Mike McCready stated, \"We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare. We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out.\"\nAn alternate version of the song was recorded with drummer Dave Abbruzzese in 1992 while the band was recording songs for the soundtrack for the 1992 film, Singles. This version was used for the music video, and was used in single releases in the United Kingdom. This version can also be found on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003).\n\"Even Flow\" was written in the key of D major, with Gossard performing his parts in open D tuning and McCready complementing it with a similar rhythm pattern in standard tuning. The recorded version of the song actually sounds slightly sharper than D major, with everything tuned up \u2014 accidentally or otherwise \u2014 around one quarter of a step. The song features a funk guitar riff by Gossard.\nMcCready on the song:\nThat's me pretending to be Stevie Ray Vaughan, and a feeble attempt at that. Stone (Gossard, Pearl Jam guitarist) wrote the riff and song; I think it's a D tuning. I just followed him in a regular pattern. I tried to steal everything I know from Stevie Ray Vaughan and put it into that song. A blatant rip-off. A tribute rip-off, if you will!\nThe vocal line that appears in the main verse begins with a very prominent tritone interval.\nThe stark lyrics by Vedder for \"Even Flow\" describe the experience of being a homeless man. The subject sleeps \"on a pillow made of concrete\" and panhandles passersby for spare change. In addition to being illiterate, he may also be mentally ill, as he \"looks insane\" when he smiles and struggles to keep coherent thoughts (\"Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies/Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away\").\nAt Pearl Jam's March 28, 1994, concert at the Bayfront Amphitheater in Miami, Vedder introduced the song by saying, \"I thought I'd throw in a bit of street education while you still have an open mind....Right across the street there's a little homeless community that lives under the bridge. You should just know that those people ain't all crazy and sometimes it's not their fault. This song is called 'Even Flow'.\"\nAt the May 12, 2008, show in Toronto, Vedder stated that the song was written under the Space Needle in Seattle. At a subsequent show in Seattle on August 8, 2018, Vedder revealed that the song was inspired by a homeless Vietnam War veteran (also named Eddie) whom he befriended while working on the band's first album. Vedder wrote the song after learning that the man had died while the band was touring.\nWhile the \"Even Flow\" single was released commercially to international markets in 1992, the commercial single was not released in the United States until June 27, 1995, and was only available as a more expensive import version beforehand. The alternate studio recording of \"Even Flow\", which was recorded in 1992 with Abbruzzese, was released as a CD single and 12-inch white vinyl in the United Kingdom. The original version was used in single releases in the United States. The song was released as a single in 1992 with a previously unreleased funk B-side titled \"Dirty Frank\", which can also be found as an extra track on European releases of"

It was written by Static Major and Timbaland, who also produced and contributed a featured rap. The song was released on April 13, 2001, as the lead single for Aaliyah's self-titled 2001 album Aaliyah.\nThe song was a moderate success internationally. \"We Need a Resolution\" reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart and the top 30 in Canada. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 119 on its list 150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years. It was placed 21st on Slant Magazine's Best of the Aughts: Singles list and 30th on Stylus Magazine's Top 50 Singles: 2000\u20132005. The single and the music video was also ranked 8th and 6th, respectively, on Slant Magazine's Best Singles and Music Videos of 2001 list. dotmusic, which was formally a part of \"Launch\" on Yahoo, felt that this song was another classy slice of experimental R&B produced by Aaliyah. It remained in the Billboard Hot 100 for 13 consecutive weeks spanning from June 2, 2001, until August 25, 2001.\nDuring the recording process for her third album Aaliyah was also filming her second movie Queen of the Damned in Australia. Due to her hectic schedule at that time, Aaliyah decided to record her album simultaneously while filming a movie. In order for it to be possible to record an album while filming a movie Aaliyah's team of producers traveled to Australia with her. Majority of the producers who are featured on the album went to Australia to with the exception of Timbaland. Due to unforeseen issues at that time with Blackground Records Timbaland was not expected to appear on Aaliyah's album at all. According to Tim Barnett, former assistant to songwriter Static Major, \"We went back to New York and did them in either Sound King or Manhattan studio. We did them right after the New Year. Part of the problem was Timbaland and Missy weren't even going to be on the album because of problems with Blackground. Aaliyah talked Tim into producing records for the album, so Timbaland did it out of love for Babygirl.\" Once Aaliyah reached out to Timbaland and asked him to produce songs for the album there were constant doubts about him meeting his deadline in time due to it being last minute. According to producer Rapture Stewart Timbaland came on board for the album during the last week before the album was finalized. Stewart also stated \"Timbaland was so busy that he wasn't able to do his songs until the last week and they didn't know if he was going to make it in time for him to do it\". Due to the uncertainty with Timbaland being able to make his deadline in time the song \"Loose Rap\" was chosen as the album's lead single. Once Timbaland submitted his songs within the deadline Aaliyah's record label decided that \"We Need a Resolution\" was going to be the lead single instead.\n\"We Need a Resolution\" has been described as having a \"seductive Middle Eastern vibe\" \"as the backing track slithers along with an almost Egyptian feel\". According to  Nateleg\u00e9 Whaley from Mic \"We Need a Resolution\" opens with warpy clarinet samples as Timbaland  dodges confrontation by repeatedly saying \"I'm tired of arguing girl.\" Aaliyah's first line in the song cuts to the chase, responding in a chill, direct manner: \"Did you sleep on the wrong side?/ I'm catching a bad vibe.\"\nOn \"We Need a Resolution\" \"Timbaland combines idiosyncratic beats, moody, off-key melodies and an insistent, dirgelike chorus for a strangely hypnotic effect\". Also the song's production has a sparse arrangement with stop-start drum patterns and hand claps. Lyrically the song maturely presents two perspectives in a passive-aggressive relationship. Aaliyah's sinuously sung concerns are playfully dismissed in Timbaland's featured rap. The song leaves its hook unresolved, plays backwards after Timbaland's rap, and concludes with a reversed loop of the vocal \"where were you last night\", which echoes the female protagonist's sentiment.\nChuck Taylor from Billboard gave the song a mixed review, although he praised Aaliyah's vocal delivery by saying, \"Aaliyah's light but direct delivery complements the hectic track well\" he ultimately felt that the overall song was classic Aaliyah and he expressed that he hoped that she would show more growth and variety just as well as she is building her budding acting resume.

It was released as the lead single from Carey's fourteenth studio album, Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse (2014). \"#Beautiful\" was written by Carey, Miguel, Nathan Perez, Brooke Davis, Mac Robinson, and Brian Keith Warfield, with Carey, Miguel and Perez producing the song. Released on May 6, 2013, Carey and Miguel did not reveal that they had collaborated on the song, until April 25, 2013, when Carey revealed the title in a 25-second teaser video during season twelve of American Idol. It was also on Idol, on May 9, that Carey premiered the official music video for \"#Beautiful\", before uploading an alternative edit to her VEVO account, that is set to the explicit version of the song.\n\"#Beautiful\" is a mid-tempo and stripped down R&B track. It received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom were complimentary of Carey's decision to collaborate with Miguel. After garnering an audience impression of 31\u00a0million in its first two days of radio airplay, the song debuted at number\u00a044 on the US Radio Songs chart. Carey taped a performance of the song along with a medley of her greatest hits on May 15, 2013; the taping aired the following day on the Season 12 finale episode of American Idol.\n\"#Beautiful\" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and at number three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the United States. It received a double Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America and is her thirteenth single which shipped over a million copies. It also peaked at number six on the Australian Singles Chart and has also received a platinum certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association and gold certification from Recorded Music NZ.\n\"#Beautiful\" was written and produced by Mariah Carey and Miguel. Rumors that Carey and Miguel had collaborated on a song together began when the pair were tweeting to each other on April 3, 2013, when Carey tweeted to Miguel praising his Saturday Night Live performance. She also revealed that they had crossed paths in a recording studio. On April 18, 2013, Carey revealed that she had finished mixing the lead single from her upcoming fourteenth studio album. On April 21, 2013, sound mixer Fletcher Allison revealed that he had been on set of a music video directed by Joseph Kahn which involved Carey and Miguel; the tweet was later deleted. The deleted tweet read \"Working on a Mariah Carey and Miguel video for the man Joseph Kahn\u00a0... Wouldn't trade this for 1,000 Coachellas\". Miguel refused to confirm if the collaboration between himself and Carey was true or not. When asked by an interviewer what he thought the a collaboration with Carey would sound like, if the rumors were true, he responded with \"I think it would sound beautiful. I think it's a great juxtaposition\". He continued to reveal that he has admired Carey for a very long time and admired her as an artist, saying \"I mean I fell in love with Mariah Carey when she walked out of the pool in [the 'Honey' video in 1997]. That 'Honey' video, that was it. And I've had a huge crush on her ever since. And, so, if we ever do have a chance, you know all respect to [Carey's husband] Nick [Cannon], all love. I think I have a huge crush more on her as a musician, and I think it would be really great\".\nOn April 25, 2013, Carey premiered a 25-second teaser video on American Idol. Over a guitar lick, the video revealed that Miguel would appear as a featured artist and that the song would be called \"#Beautiful\", accompanied by a message which read \"The new era begins\". Other aspects of the teaser showed a motorbike and Carey giggling. The song premiered on May 6, 2013, and was released for digital download on the US iTunes store the next day. It officially impacted US Mainstream and Rhythmic radio on May 7, 2013. On the day of its premiere on May 6, 2013, Clear Channel Media and Entertainment launched the single with a day-long world premiere event across more than 230 Clear Channel radio stations nationwide. Beginning 7am, \"#Beautiful\" played at the top of each hour until 11pm on Top 40, Rhythmic, AC, Hot AC and Urban stations.\nThe artwork for \"#Beautiful\" was released on May 3, 2013. It"

It was released as the lead single on June 9, 2014, via Republic Records. The song was written by Caillat, Babyface and Jason Reeves and was produced by Babyface. Lyrically, the midtempo pop ballad is about not trying to be someone else to make others happy. It was written after a session where Caillat was feeling pressure to be someone she was not, both musically and image-wise. It received acclaim from music critics, who noted it was a simple, but beautiful empowering ballad.\nThe song charted moderately on the US Billboard Hot 100, while becoming her highest-charting single in five years in Australia and Canada. It also became a top 40 hit in Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. To promote the song, a lyric video including female fans and artists, such as Sheryl Crow, Sara Bareilles, Christina Perri and others, without any makeup on, to emphasize the song message, was released on June 10, 2014. Later, an official music video was released on July 8, 2014. It features the singer alongside a diverse set of women with makeup and wigs, while removing them throughout the video, ending it natural. It went viral over the internet, accumulating over 27 million views in almost two months. The song was certified platinum by the RIAA on March 20, 2015.\nAfter releasing her first Christmas album, Christmas in the Sand (2012), and contributing to the soundtrack of the 2013 film Safe Haven, with the song \"We Both Know\", a duet with Gavin DeGraw, Caillat recorded during the summer of 2013 a new album with a \"\u201970s vibe\" with producer John Shanks. It was set to be released in November 2013; however, after meeting up with Ryan Tedder, Caillat decided to record a more \"pop, up-tempo dancey\" album. Caillat also worked with record producer and songwriter Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds on the album, explaining, \"We did four or five songs. I love him as a producer and writer. I just tell him any style that I\u2019m in the mood for and we write it. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s pigeonholed in being an R&B producer. The first song we wrote together is a complete folk song that\u2019s going to be on this record. It has a banjo on it! The next song is R&B-pop, and then the next one we did is completely a piano ballad, no harmonies \u2014 it\u2019s really honest and vulnerable.\"\nThe synthpop-infused track \"Hold On\", produced by Tedder, was released as the album's lead single. However, the song failed to make an impact on the charts, and the album was postponed. Caillat and her label thought they should keep working and see if they got anything better. The response disappointed the singer, who was told to return to the studio to find a \"new sound\" for the album. \"To be told that your work isn't good enough -- to do better, to be more like those pop artists out there that dress sexy and use Auto-tune on their voices -- to be compared to someone so different, it hurt,\" she claimed. Later, Caillat decided to release an EP, claiming that \"12 songs is too much to listen to all at once. When I buy a record, I get to the fifth song, and then I don't get to really hear the rest of the record. People can listen to the first five songs, fall in love with them, get to know them, and then a few months later, have the rest of the record available for download.\" To promote the EP, \"Gypsy Heart: Side A\", \"Try\" was chosen to be its lead-single, being the iTunes Store single of the week from June 9 to June 16, 2014, and it would be officially released to Mainstream radio stations in early September. On October 21, 2014, the song was serviced to contemporary hit radio by Republic Records; a new \"Uptempo Mix\" will officially impact the format on January 13, 2015. This version was released to digital retailers on November 24, 2014 under the official name \"Alex Ghenea Remix\".\n\"Try\", a pop song, was written by Colbie Caillat, Antonio Dixon, Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds and Jason Reeves, while production was done by Babyface. It is written in the time signature of common time and is composed in the key of D\u266d major, with a moderately slow tempo of 70 beats per minute. Caillat's vocal range span from the low-note of A\u266d\u2083 to the high-note of F\u2085. As noted by Holly Williams of Contact Music, the song is \"full of gently plucked acoustic guitar, twinkling synths and minimal piano that adds a pleasantly uplifting touch, while Colbie's vocals are soft, yet understated - almost as if she's inviting you to sing along with her.\" According to Billboard, \"the song resulted from a"

Lyrically inspired by Cocker's experiences socializing in Sheffield as an outcast, the song features lyrics that call for misfits to unite and take over. This lyrical theme would make Cocker uncomfortable with Pulp's growing popularity with \"townies\" after the song's release.\n\"Mis-Shapes\" was released as a double-A sided single with \"Sorted for E's & Wizz\", the second single from Different Class after \"Common People.\" Like its predecessor, the single reached number two in the UK charts and has since seen critical acclaim.\n\"Mis-Shapes\" was written as an ode to the outcasts that Pulp as a band identified with. Drummer Nick Banks summed up the song's message, stating, \"What an opener, a call to arms, a rallying cry, now is the time to storm the barricades. If you've ever been bullied, called a weirdo, hit, spat at for being, looking, or feeling different... this is your tune!\" At a 1995 concert, frontman Jarvis Cocker introduced the song as a call to take on the \"blokes with 'taches in short-sleeved white shirts telling you that you're the weirdo.\"\nLyrically, the song was inspired by Cocker's experience going to clubs in his home town of Sheffield during the 1980s. He recalled:\nIt was quite dangerous to go into the centre of town on a weekend night, as everyone socialised there. You'd get these packs of blokes, all dressed the same in the white short-sleeved shirt, black trousers and loafers, and they'd call you a queer or want to smack you 'cos they didn't like your jacket. The thing is, those people hunt in packs, whereas the misfits or mis-shapes, because of the fact that they're more individualistic, are easier targets. So the idea of 'Mis-Shapes' is the fancy that the misfits would form some kind of an alliance or army, and take over.\nCocker reflected on the song's contradiction with the laddish audience the Britpop scene attracted, \"All you can do is be as precise and be as good at what you do as possible and throw it out there. You can't control who goes into the shop and buys your records, you can't say, 'Oh, we're going to move into a more mature market.' People have to decide that. I mean, you write a song like 'Mis-Shapes' and it should be perfectly clear that it's saying, 'I don't like intolerant people.' But it's become clear to me after that last tour that it goes over some people's heads. Townies were coming out to see us.\"\nThe song's guitar solo was initially composed by Cocker, but its final version was modified by recently-joined guitarist Mark Webber, who called the song one of his favorites in 1996. The song's title, according to Cocker, originates from his \"mum buying mis-shaped chocolates.\" Cocker recalled, \"'Mis-Shapes' are these chocolates and they used to have them in the sweet-shop next to our house. They were the ones that had gone wrong in the factory - they were misshapen - kind of 'elephant man' of the sweet world! You could buy them in a bag much cheaper than a normal box of chocolates would be and they tasted as good, it's just that aesthetically they weren't that pleasing so that seemed to be a fairly reasonable metaphor.\"\nDeborah Orr of The Guardian described \"Mis-Shapes\" as \"the song that contains Cocker's statement of intent,\" while The Telegraph called the track \"[Cocker's] anthem to nerd youth, a battle-cry to misfits everywhere.\" Cocker said of the song's lyrical content:\nI've always had a problem with songs that tried to tackle social issues. I'm thinking of 'Another Day in Paradise', I'm thinking of 'Belfast Child'. Mis-Shapes is probably the nearest I've got to a sloganeering song for the sake of it. I think I just scraped through because it's based on the feeling of a Saturday night in Sheffield when the beer monsters are out, wanting to smack you because you're wearing funny glasses, a funny haircut and orange trousers - and you have to run away.\nDavid Stubbs of Melody Maker described the song as \"musically is so cleverly redolent of the glitzy plasticity of glam but also lino on bedsit floors.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the song a \"faux-show tune romp.\"\n\"Mis-Shapes\" was released as a double A-sided single with \"Sorted for E's & Wizz\" on 25 September 1995. The double-A sided single reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, though the single did attract controversy due to the drug themes of \"Sorted for E's and"

It was released in May 2011 as the third single from Paisley's album This Is Country Music (2011). The music video for the song premiered on CMT on July 26, 2011. The song was also named Taste of Country's Song of The Year for 2011. Paisley wrote this song with Kelley Lovelace and Chris DuBois.\nIn an interview at the Billboard Country Music Summit in June 2011, Underwood described the recording of the song as \"the most unorganized thing [she] had ever been a part of\" but added that it \"all worked out so perfectly.\" She and Paisley had previously discussed recording a duet for This Is Country Music but couldn't coordinate their schedules before the album was due to be completed in December 2010. The album was pushed back and Paisley contacted Underwood in February 2011, sending her a work tape of \"Remind Me\" with \"a lot of mumbling\" and Sheryl Crow singing the female part. Underwood saw potential in the song and flew from Los Angeles to Nashville to meet with Paisley, where they recorded the song on February 11, 2011. Upon the album's release in May 2011, Paisley expressed his hope that \"Remind Me\" would be its third single and described the decision to ask Underwood to perform on the song with him as an easy one.\nIn May 2013, songwriter Amy Bowen filed a $10 million lawsuit against the song's writers, claiming that they had stolen the idea from a song that she wrote in 2007.\nThe song's topic is about a married couple in seek of rekindling the flame of their relationship they once carried. It is set at a slow tempo of 69 beats per minute in the key of F major, with a vocal range from F3 to A5 and a primary chord pattern of F-Dm-C-B\u266d.\nThe duet has been met with favorable reviews. Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song a B rating, saying the song is \"loaded with potential\" but \"trying too hard to be a big event.\" It received a five-out-of-five star rating from Billy Dukes of Taste of Country, who says \"Underwood's vocals are pristine, and Paisley does more than enough to keep up.\" Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave the song a 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying that \"it's hard to find a good vocal match for Carrie, but no matter how much she tries to dial herself down, her powerhouse voice still makes Brad's very limited range all the more obvious. But that's a small complaint for an otherwise-excellent song.\" Zimbio gave the song five stars out five, saying that \"You can actually feel the longing and the pain in both Brad and Carrie\u2019s vocals throughout the single. The lyrics are well written, and lets you actually picture the memories they are talking about\" and stated the duet is a potential Number One.\n\"Remind Me\" entered the Hot Country Songs charts at number 36 on the chart dated for the week ending May 26, 2011. The duet also debuted at number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, for the week of June 16, 2011 and debuted at number 78 on the Canadian Hot 100. The song reached the top of the Hot Country Songs chart. It sold 42,000 digital copies in its first week. At number 17, it is Paisley's highest ranking song on the Billboard Hot 100.\nThe song was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on September 30, 2013, and has sold 2,152,000 copies as of January 2016.\nThe music video for Remind Me was filmed on June 27, 2011, at El Mirage Lake, California. Deaton-Flanigen directed the video.\nIt shows Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood walking towards each other in the desert while they sing the song for each other. She is wearing a floral dress and he is wearing a shirt, jeans and a white cowboy hat. The desert represents their actual relationship like a barrel by walking towards each other is like they are trying to rekindle the relationship. In the end, they are finally face-to-face. This open end leaves up in the air if they will remind each other, just like the song.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry Weekly: Carrie Underwood Talks Brad Paisley Duet\n\"Videos\u00a0: Brad Paisley\u00a0: Remind Me With Carrie Underwood\".

Featuring a disco-inspired musical performance, the song was based on Pulp singer Jarvis Cocker's childhood memories of his friend Deborah Bone, who he had \"fancied\" in his youth but could never impress.\n\"Disco 2000\" was released as a single on 27 November 1995, the third from Different Class. The single reached number seven in the UK and charted in several others. The single release was accompanied by a music video directed by Pedro Romhanyi, which was based on the story told on the single's sleeve artwork. The song has since become one of Pulp's most famous tracks and has seen critical acclaim.\n\"Disco 2000\" tells the story of a narrator falling for a childhood friend called Deborah, who is more popular than he is and wondering what it would be like to meet again when they are older. Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker based the lyrics on a girl he knew as a child and recalled, \"the only bit that isn't true is the woodchip wallpaper.\" He elaborated:\nThere was a girl called Deborah\u2014she was born in the same hospital as me. Not within an hour\u2014I think it was like three hours\u2014but you can't fit three hours into the song without having to really rush the singing! ... But basically you know the whole thing was the same\u2014I fancied her for ages and then she started to become a woman and her breasts began to sprout so then all the boys fancied her then. I didn't stand a 'cat-in-hell's chance'. But then I did use to sometimes hang around outside her house and stuff like that.\nDeborah was based on a real-life childhood friend of Cocker's, Deborah Bone, who moved away from Sheffield to Letchworth when she was 10. As the lyrics suggest, she did marry and have children. Bone later reflected, \"My claim to fame is growing up and sleeping with Jarvis Cocker, well someone had to do it, and it was all perfectly innocent! I have been told and like to believe that I am the Deborah in the Number 1 hit 'Disco 2000,' but we never did get to meet up by the fountain down the road.\"\nThe fountain referred to as the meeting place was Goodwin Fountain, formerly located on Fargate, in Sheffield city centre.\n\"Disco 2000\" took inspiration from disco music. Martin Aston of Attitude described the song as \"seventies \u00e0 go-go: the stamp of Elton John's 'Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting', Marc Bolan's glittery guitar, ABBA's sweeping gait and a huge swipe from Laura Brannigan's Hi-NRG epic 'Gloria'.\"\nDrummer Nick Banks said of this influence, \"We are very much influenced by disco, yeah. And of course in the late '80s we got into raves a bit, and music did take on more of a disco thump in places. Yeah, I'm always going down the disco, I love it.\"\n\"Disco 2000\" was released as the third single from Different Class on 27 November 1995. The single reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the third top 10 single from Different Class, following \"Common People\" and the double A-side \"Mis-Shapes\"/\"Sorted for E's & Wizz\", both of which reached number two. The song also charted highly in Austria, Finland, Hungary, Iceland and Ireland, and it became Pulp's only top-fifty hit in Australia.\nDue to its millennial subject matter, Pulp removed the song's synchronisation licence, effectively banning the song from being used in TV and radio trailers throughout 1999 and 2000.\nThe music video for \"Disco 2000\", directed by Pedro Romhanyi, adapted the story portrayed on the single's cover sleeve designed by Donald Milne. The video features a boy and a girl, played by models Patrick Skinny and Jo Skinny, respectively, meeting at a Saturday night disco and hooking up afterwards. The video, which features the song's 7-inch mix, featured the members of Pulp represented on cardboard cutouts and on televisions throughout (for this reason, drummer Nick Banks called the song \"the easiest video [they] ever did\"). Romhanyi explains:\nSo, in the video we duplicate the photo shoot, changing the order in a couple of cases, and of course add a lot of new stuff - the track is over five minutes long. Donald Milne's work for the album and single is like an artificial version of the real world, where all its mundane features have been removed. So this is what we had to recreate - the Pulp world - without Pulp being in it. The idea"

Lyrically inspired by Cocker's experiences socializing in Sheffield as an outcast, the song features lyrics that call for misfits to unite and take over. This lyrical theme would make Cocker uncomfortable with Pulp's growing popularity with \"townies\" after the song's release.\n\"Mis-Shapes\" was released as a double-A sided single with \"Sorted for E's & Wizz\", the second single from Different Class after \"Common People.\" Like its predecessor, the single reached number two in the UK charts and has since seen critical acclaim.\n\"Mis-Shapes\" was written as an ode to the outcasts that Pulp as a band identified with. Drummer Nick Banks summed up the song's message, stating, \"What an opener, a call to arms, a rallying cry, now is the time to storm the barricades. If you've ever been bullied, called a weirdo, hit, spat at for being, looking, or feeling different... this is your tune!\" At a 1995 concert, frontman Jarvis Cocker introduced the song as a call to take on the \"blokes with 'taches in short-sleeved white shirts telling you that you're the weirdo.\"\nLyrically, the song was inspired by Cocker's experience going to clubs in his home town of Sheffield during the 1980s. He recalled:\nIt was quite dangerous to go into the centre of town on a weekend night, as everyone socialised there. You'd get these packs of blokes, all dressed the same in the white short-sleeved shirt, black trousers and loafers, and they'd call you a queer or want to smack you 'cos they didn't like your jacket. The thing is, those people hunt in packs, whereas the misfits or mis-shapes, because of the fact that they're more individualistic, are easier targets. So the idea of 'Mis-Shapes' is the fancy that the misfits would form some kind of an alliance or army, and take over.\nCocker reflected on the song's contradiction with the laddish audience the Britpop scene attracted, \"All you can do is be as precise and be as good at what you do as possible and throw it out there. You can't control who goes into the shop and buys your records, you can't say, 'Oh, we're going to move into a more mature market.' People have to decide that. I mean, you write a song like 'Mis-Shapes' and it should be perfectly clear that it's saying, 'I don't like intolerant people.' But it's become clear to me after that last tour that it goes over some people's heads. Townies were coming out to see us.\"\nThe song's guitar solo was initially composed by Cocker, but its final version was modified by recently-joined guitarist Mark Webber, who called the song one of his favorites in 1996. The song's title, according to Cocker, originates from his \"mum buying mis-shaped chocolates.\" Cocker recalled, \"'Mis-Shapes' are these chocolates and they used to have them in the sweet-shop next to our house. They were the ones that had gone wrong in the factory - they were misshapen - kind of 'elephant man' of the sweet world! You could buy them in a bag much cheaper than a normal box of chocolates would be and they tasted as good, it's just that aesthetically they weren't that pleasing so that seemed to be a fairly reasonable metaphor.\"\nDeborah Orr of The Guardian described \"Mis-Shapes\" as \"the song that contains Cocker's statement of intent,\" while The Telegraph called the track \"[Cocker's] anthem to nerd youth, a battle-cry to misfits everywhere.\" Cocker said of the song's lyrical content:\nI've always had a problem with songs that tried to tackle social issues. I'm thinking of 'Another Day in Paradise', I'm thinking of 'Belfast Child'. Mis-Shapes is probably the nearest I've got to a sloganeering song for the sake of it. I think I just scraped through because it's based on the feeling of a Saturday night in Sheffield when the beer monsters are out, wanting to smack you because you're wearing funny glasses, a funny haircut and orange trousers - and you have to run away.\nDavid Stubbs of Melody Maker described the song as \"musically is so cleverly redolent of the glitzy plasticity of glam but also lino on bedsit floors.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the song a \"faux-show tune romp.\"\n\"Mis-Shapes\" was released as a double A-sided single with \"Sorted for E's & Wizz\" on 25 September 1995. The double-A sided single reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, though the single did attract controversy due to the drug themes of \"Sorted for E's and"

It reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming a defining track of the Britpop movement as well as Pulp's signature song in the process. In 2014, BBC Radio 6 Music listeners voted it their favourite Britpop song in an online poll. In a 2015 Rolling Stone readers' poll it was voted the greatest Britpop song.\nThe song is a critique on those who were perceived as wanting to be \"like common people\" and who ascribe glamour to poverty. This phenomenon is referred to as slumming or \"class tourism\". The song was written by the band members Jarvis Cocker, Nick Banks, Candida Doyle, Steve Mackey and Russell Senior. Cocker had conceived the song after meeting a Greek art student while studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London (the college and the student feature in the lyrics). He came up with the tune on a Casiotone keyboard he had bought in a music store in Notting Hill, west London.\nJustin Myers of the Official Charts Company wrote, '\"Common People\" was typical Pulp \u2013 a biting satire of posh people \u2018roughing it\u2019 and acting like tourists by hanging with the \"common people\". Jarvis delivered his scathing putdown with glee, in an iconic music video featuring actress Sadie Frost as the posho on the receiving end of Jarvis' acid tongue.' Pulp first performed the song in public during the band's set at the Reading Festival in August 1994. A year later they performed it at Glastonbury Festival as the headline act. The song has since been covered by various artists. In 2004, a Ben Folds-produced cover version by William Shatner brought \"Common People\" to new audiences outside Europe.\nThe idea for the song's lyrics came from a Greek art student whom Pulp singer-songwriter Jarvis Cocker met while he was studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Cocker had enrolled in a film studies course at the college in September 1988 while taking a break from Pulp. He spoke about the song's inspiration in NME in 2013:\nI'd met the girl from the song many years before, when I was at St Martin's College. I'd met her on a sculpture course, but at St Martin's you had a thing called Crossover Fortnight, where you had to do another discipline for a couple of weeks. I was studying film, and she might've been doing painting, but we both decided to do sculpture for two weeks. I don't know her name. It would've been around 1988, so it was already ancient history when I wrote about her.\nIn a 2012 question-and-answer session on BBC Radio 5 Live Cocker said that he was having a conversation with the girl at the bar at college because he was attracted to her, although he found some aspects of her personality unpleasant. He remembered that at one point she had told him she \"wanted to move to Hackney and live like 'the common people'\u2009\". Cocker used this phrase as the starting point for the song and embellished the situation for dramatic effect, for example reversing the situation in the song when the female character declares that \"I want to sleep with common people like you\" (Cocker said that in real life he had been the one wanting to sleep with the girl, while she had not been interested in him). Taking this inspiration, the narrator explains that his female acquaintance can \"never be like common people\", because even if she gets a flat where \"roaches climb the wall\" ultimately, \"if [she] called [her] dad he could stop it all\", in contrast to the true common people who can only \"watch [their] lives slide out of view\".\nA BBC Three documentary failed to locate the woman, who, Cocker stated, could have been in any fine art course but that \"sculpture\" sounded better. The lyrics were in part a response by Cocker, who usually focused on the introspective and emotional aspects of pop, to more politically minded members of the band like Russell Senior. Furthermore, Cocker felt that 'slumming' was becoming a dominant theme in popular culture and this contributed to the single's rushed release. Cocker said \"it seemed to be in the air, that kind of patronising social voyeurism... I felt that of Parklife, for example, or Natural Born Killers \u2013 there is that noble savage notion. But if you walk round a council estate, there's plenty of savagery and not much nobility going on.\"\nIn May 2015, Greek newspaper Athens Voice"

Lyrically inspired by Cocker's experiences socializing in Sheffield as an outcast, the song features lyrics that call for misfits to unite and take over. This lyrical theme would make Cocker uncomfortable with Pulp's growing popularity with \"townies\" after the song's release.\n\"Mis-Shapes\" was released as a double-A sided single with \"Sorted for E's & Wizz\", the second single from Different Class after \"Common People.\" Like its predecessor, the single reached number two in the UK charts and has since seen critical acclaim.\n\"Mis-Shapes\" was written as an ode to the outcasts that Pulp as a band identified with. Drummer Nick Banks summed up the song's message, stating, \"What an opener, a call to arms, a rallying cry, now is the time to storm the barricades. If you've ever been bullied, called a weirdo, hit, spat at for being, looking, or feeling different... this is your tune!\" At a 1995 concert, frontman Jarvis Cocker introduced the song as a call to take on the \"blokes with 'taches in short-sleeved white shirts telling you that you're the weirdo.\"\nLyrically, the song was inspired by Cocker's experience going to clubs in his home town of Sheffield during the 1980s. He recalled:\nIt was quite dangerous to go into the centre of town on a weekend night, as everyone socialised there. You'd get these packs of blokes, all dressed the same in the white short-sleeved shirt, black trousers and loafers, and they'd call you a queer or want to smack you 'cos they didn't like your jacket. The thing is, those people hunt in packs, whereas the misfits or mis-shapes, because of the fact that they're more individualistic, are easier targets. So the idea of 'Mis-Shapes' is the fancy that the misfits would form some kind of an alliance or army, and take over.\nCocker reflected on the song's contradiction with the laddish audience the Britpop scene attracted, \"All you can do is be as precise and be as good at what you do as possible and throw it out there. You can't control who goes into the shop and buys your records, you can't say, 'Oh, we're going to move into a more mature market.' People have to decide that. I mean, you write a song like 'Mis-Shapes' and it should be perfectly clear that it's saying, 'I don't like intolerant people.' But it's become clear to me after that last tour that it goes over some people's heads. Townies were coming out to see us.\"\nThe song's guitar solo was initially composed by Cocker, but its final version was modified by recently-joined guitarist Mark Webber, who called the song one of his favorites in 1996. The song's title, according to Cocker, originates from his \"mum buying mis-shaped chocolates.\" Cocker recalled, \"'Mis-Shapes' are these chocolates and they used to have them in the sweet-shop next to our house. They were the ones that had gone wrong in the factory - they were misshapen - kind of 'elephant man' of the sweet world! You could buy them in a bag much cheaper than a normal box of chocolates would be and they tasted as good, it's just that aesthetically they weren't that pleasing so that seemed to be a fairly reasonable metaphor.\"\nDeborah Orr of The Guardian described \"Mis-Shapes\" as \"the song that contains Cocker's statement of intent,\" while The Telegraph called the track \"[Cocker's] anthem to nerd youth, a battle-cry to misfits everywhere.\" Cocker said of the song's lyrical content:\nI've always had a problem with songs that tried to tackle social issues.

Written by Sj\u00f3n based on a story by Bj\u00f6rk, the lyrics of \"Isobel\" tell the story of the title character, who is magically born in a forest and sends a message of instinct amongst the logic thinking of the people of the city. The story of Isobel has been explored in \"Human Behaviour\" and \"Bachelorette\", forming a trilogy. The track was released as the second single for the album as two different CD releases in August 1995. Featuring additional songwriting by Nellee Hooper and Marius de Vries, string arrangements by Eumir Deodato and production by Hooper and Bj\u00f6rk, \"Isobel\" combines a lush orchestral sound with electronic breakbeats.\nMost commentators were enticed by \"Isobel\", which they declared one of the highlights of the Post album. The single peaked at number eighteen on the Finnish Singles Chart, twenty-three on the UK Singles Charts and forty-seven on the New Zealand Singles Chart. The song was included in the compilation album Greatest Hits (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey.\nThe accompanying music video for \"Isobel\" was directed by frequent collaborator Michel Gondry and represents the story the lyrics convey. The surreal video resembles an early film and garnered acclaim from critics, although it received no support from MTV. Bj\u00f6rk has performed \"Isobel\" on various television shows and in six of her tours, the most recent being the Utopia Tour.\n\"Isobel\" originated amongst the most complicated in the tracks contained in Post and perhaps in all of Bj\u00f6rk's work. The song's lyrics were written in collaboration with Icelandic poet Sj\u00f3n, his very first songlyric. Together with \u00de\u00f3r Eldon, Bj\u00f6rk's ex-husband and member of the Sugarcubes, Sj\u00f3n and the singer had been part of a circle of anarchist poets in Reykjavik called Medusa and had met while she was a member of Kukl. Sj\u00f3n would become a frequent collaborator throughout Bj\u00f6rk's career.\nBj\u00f6rk came up with the melody for \"Isobel\" during a Christmas visit to her native Iceland. She worked on a portable Casio keyboard and brought it to Nellee Hooper \u2014British producer who had produced her previous studio album, Debut (1993)\u2014 who added a snare and sound effects to Brazilian musician Eumir Deodato's string arrangements. Deodato explained his work: \"In some of the songs I followed her secondary vocal lines; there was very little harmony and very few chords. I was doing that on 'Isobel' too, where I wrote a natural C in a line that was in B minor. Much later on I learned that Bj\u00f6rk is the type of singer who will sing the A sharp in A minor, but I wasn't yet aware that she did that when I did that first song.\"\nThe lyrics were the final addition to the song. The original idea for the lyrics dates back to late 1994, when a moth stayed on the collar of Bj\u00f6rk's shirt until the evening. Interpreting the incident as a kind of omen, she tried to create a story and a character about it, writing 900 pages of a diary. She recalls: \"I'd been fighting like a lunatic, and going completely bonkers. I knew that if I waited for three months, threw away the book, preferably burning it, then I'd wake up one morning with the lyric. But I badly wanted this song on the album. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\" Thus she decided to contact Sj\u00f3n, explaining the story of the title character to him.\nThe song forms a trilogy with \"Human Behaviour\" of Debut (1993) and \"Bachelorette\" of Homogenic (1997). Bj\u00f6rk explained: \"In 'Human Behaviour', she's a little girl. In 'Isobel', she moves to the big city and big lights. [...] In 'Bachelorette' she takes over and trees grow over the city\". Their respective music videos, directed by Michel Gondry, represent this story. In a 2008 interview with Stereogum, she also included \"Oceania\" of Med\u00falla (2004) and \"Wanderlust\" of Volta (2007) in this narrative cycle.\n\"Isobel\" is a string-laden, orchestral trip hop song written by Bj\u00f6rk, Nellee Hooper, Marius de Vries and Sj\u00f3n. According to pianist Steve Boudreau, the main chord progression is a variant of the Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart staple \"My Funny Valentine\", with both songs relying on a minor chord with all the harmonic motion in the upper voice. In \"My Funny Valentine\" it descends chromatically from the root, while in \"Isobel\" it forms more of a circle. Various critics have discussed the song's distinctive pace, with Pulse!'s Tom Lanham"

Released following a highly publicized campaign by G-Unit, to release Tony Yayo from prison prior to the song's release, \"So Seductive\" is an uptempo \"club banger\" containing elements of string instruments and a repetitive bassline in its instrumentation. The song received little promotion from Tony Yayo at the time of its release, as he was still under house arrest following the end of his prison sentence, although he has since performed the song during various live performances.\n\"So Seductive\" became Tony Yayo's most commercially successful song, peaking at number 48 on the Billboard Hot 100; it also remains Tony Yayo's only song to chart outside the United States, peaking in the top 30 of the Irish and United Kingdom singles charts. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its energy and 50 Cent's performance in the chorus, although some wrote negatively towards Yayo's rapping and also noted a lack of originality in the song's production. \"So Seductive\" was nominated for best \"Club Banger\" at the 2005 Vibe Awards, but lost to \"1 Thing\" by Amerie.\nOn December 31, 2002, G-Unit rappers Tony Yayo and 50 Cent were arrested for illegal weapon possession. Following a further background check, it was discovered that Yayo had an outstanding warrant for a previous such charge: as a result, he was sentenced for bail jumping, and spent the entirety of 2003 in prison at Lakeview Shock Incarceration Correctional Facility. During this time, G-Unit rose to mainstream prominence following the commercial success of 50 Cent's album Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003), which sold 872,000 copies in its 1st week on sale in the United States and contained the Billboard number 1 singles \"In Da Club\" and \"21 Questions\". The group also released their debut album, Beg for Mercy, in 2003, which featured the US top-15 singles \"Stunt 101\" and \"Wanna Get to Know You\". Yayo appeared on the song \"Like My Style\", which appears on Get Rich or Die Tryin', and on the songs \"Groupie Love\" and \"I Smell Pussy\", which are included on Beg for Mercy.\nDuring Tony Yayo's incarceration, G-Unit began a campaign called \"Free Yayo\", which involved wearing \"Free Yayo\" shirts advertising his situation; due to the mainstream prominence of the group, Tony Yayo began to receive increased attention from the Hip Hop community, becoming known as the \"mythical 4th member of G-Unit\", although Yayo himself was unaware of the coverage he attracted. The campaign received widespread publicity, even in countries such as Brazil and Iraq. At the 46th Grammy Awards, 50 Cent and Eminem performed whilst wearing \"Free Yayo\" shirts. Yayo watched the performance on television in prison after receiving a call from the Shady offices advising him to do so; he had never seen the shirts before, and was inspired by them to work hard to improve his rapping before his release from prison. He was granted parole from his sentence on January 8, 2004, but was discovered to be in possession of a forged passport, following a check from his parole officer, and was sent back to prison until May 25, 2004.\nFollowing his release, Tony Yayo appeared on several mixtapes to increase his exposure amongst underground hip hop audiences, and began to record his debut album, titled Thoughts of a Predicate Felon (2005), almost immediately after leaving prison, although he was still detained under house arrest and required to wear an ankle bracelet, and thus could not personally promote any of the album's material. \"So Seductive\" was released as the album's 1st single via Interscope in the United States and Canada on May 17, 2005 via Music download, and was released to rhythmic and urban contemporary radio stations in the United States on May 24, 2005. The CD single was distributed via Polydor Records.\nThe song was featured in the 2005 Xbox video game 50 Cent Bulletproof. Tony Yayo appears in the video game providing his own voice and likeness and is a playable character in arcade mode.\n\"So Seductive\" was written by Tony Yayo, 50 Cent and Michael Harper, and was produced by the latter under his production name Punch, who was also responsible for the song's instruments.

It was released on June 1, 2010 by Young Money, Cash Money, and Universal Motown as the lead single of the album. The song was written by Minaj, Joseph Hughes, David Freeman, and Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel, and was produced by the latter. Minaj originally intended to release \"Massive Attack\" as the lead single from Pink Friday, though its release was scrapped after an underwhelming commercial performance.\nDescribed as a \"rap ballad\", the song is a change of tempo compared to Minaj's previous work, and according to Mariel Concepcion of Billboard, the song contains a \"new brand of hood majesty.\" The song samples Annie Lennox's 1995 cover version of the song \"No More I Love You's\" (1986) by The Lover Speaks, using its background vocals with additional bass, hip-hop backbeats and drum loops added. The song peaked at numbers 14 and four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts, respectively. As of June 2016 the song has sold 1.5 million digital downloads.\nThe first version of \"Your Love\" appeared on Nicki Minaj's unofficial mixtape Barbie World (2010), with different lyrics included in the pre-chorus along with a faster pace. Another version was later stolen and leaked online. The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying \"That was a leak and I was so upset they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago. Next thing you know, people started falling in love with it.\" Whilst on set on the music video for \"Your Love\", Minaj further explain about the song's theft and leak, saying, \n\"I was not planning on putting the song out at all. But then I heard it one day, somebody told me it was online. And I was like, 'No way, no way in the world that song is out.' I went and listened to it and was really upset. It wasn't mixed, it wasn't finished, it wasn't anything \u2014 I wasn't gonna use it at all. But then radio started playing it.\"\nRap-Up posted cover art featuring a close up of Minaj smirking to her right, however for unknown reasons the art work was changed. The new cover features a cartoon version of Minaj, made by illustrator Asia Kendrick-Horton who posted it for Minaj on Twitter.\n\"Your Love\" is a mid-tempo song with the heavy use of Auto-Tune in the chorus. It samples the instrumentals and background vocals of Annie Lennox's cover version of \"No More I Love You's\" by the Lover Speaks, with the addition of additional bass, drum-loops and hip-hop backbeats. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, \"Your Love\" is set in common time with a metronome of 94 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Minaj's vocal range spanning from the low-note of B\u2083 to the high-note of C\u266f\u2085.\nSara D. Anderson of AOL Radio Blog described the song as a \"rap/singing mash-up.\" Coined as a \"new brand of hood majesty,\" the song is accompanied by a simple beat, which includes finger snaps and \"xylophone clings.\" Lean Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented: \"Rap's spitfire explores her softer side, sampling Annie Lennox on her honey-tongued ode to a good man.\" Greenblatt went on to compare the song to Jay-Z's \"kindred\" \"Young Forever.\" Minaj makes several references in her lines to well known people, which includes Bruce Willis in Die Hard, as well as Adam and Eve. Minaj makes several connections to Superman including in the pre-chorus, \"'S' on my chest, let me get my cape on.\" The official remix featuring Cash Money labelmate Jay Sean was leaked via-internet on August 2, 2010, and later made available for purchase in Australia via iTunes. American rapper Flo Rida released an unofficial remix to the song, in which he adds a verse. Reggae recording artist Sean Paul also did a remix to the song where he ad-libs his verse throughout the original and later adds his own verse. Other remixes to the song include those done by American rapper Rick Ross and American R&B singer Chris Brown.\nRap-Up stated that Minaj \"slows down her rapid-fire verses on the sticky and sweet \"Your Love\" ... with a sprinkling of Auto-Tune to top it off. Young Money's First Lady even exercises her vocal chops. We demand another helping.\""

Taken from a yet to be titled EP, David Aud\u00e9 produced the single. \"I'm Still Hot\" peaked at No. 1 on both the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs and Hot Dance Airplay charts. As part of its social media campaign to build awareness about life settlements, The Lifeline Program released a second version of the song featuring comedian and actress Betty White on 22 September 2011.\nAfter Luciana moved to the U.S. in late 2010, she met producer Aud\u00e9, and went to the recording studio to lay down the vocals for the track which he later produced.\nIn 2011, Luciana collaborated with White to produce the vocals and music video for the second version of \"I'm Still Hot\". The Lifeline Program released the music video on its website and on YouTube on Oct. 12, 2011. Good Morning America broadcast the world premiere of the music video live, spawning a host of national media coverage encompassing local news stations, news websites, social media networks, blogs, video logs and national entertainment news television programs.\nThe version of the song featuring White remains available for purchase on iTunes, and a portion of the proceeds of its sales benefits the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association.\nThere are two different music videos for this song.\nThe original music video was filmed throughout Los Angeles. The video starts with Luciana waking up on a bed with some men and then she has some flashbacks from the party the night before. She then walks down the street with a stereo and a microphone and starts to sing and dance. The Burgoyne Brothers directed the video.\nThe music video with White begins with White standing outside of the Los Angeles Zoo saying what a nice day she has had. Then Luciana turns up outside of the zoo in a limousine and shouts \"Oi Betty! Come and check out my hot wheels!\" The video then goes to White and Luciana in a song, dance and rapping battle. Bodybuilders and a boa constrictor serve as White's entourage as White hand-feeds the bare-chested men slices of cheesecake, an appropriation to The Golden Girls\u2014the television sitcom perhaps most responsible for establishing Betty White as a household name. Joey Sergo (also known as Joey Swoll) stars as one of the bodybuilders.\nThe video has a duration of four minutes and 29 seconds, and is available for viewing on The Lifeline Program website and on YouTube.\n\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (Original Mix) \u2013 3:06\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (Original Extended) \u2013 4:51\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (R3hab Remix) \u2013 4:07\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (Dave Aud\u00e9 Remix) \u2013 6:03\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (SuperMal Remix) \u2013 4:45\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (Revolvr & Scotty Boy Remix) \u2013 5:19\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (Ecotek & James Egbert Remix) \u2013 5:29\n\"I'm Still Hot\" (featuring Betty White) \u2013 2:33\n\nThe song made its first appearance on US Dance Charts at 43 and after a 7-week climb it topped both US Club Songs and Airplay Charts.

(2012). The song was released as a promotional single to the iTunes Store as Single of the Week on October 22, 2012, and was later announced to be the second single from the album. On February 12, 2013, the song was released to Top 40 radio.\nThe song debuted and peaked at number one on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart.\n\"Hurricane\" exhibits elements of rap, gospel and pop. Built on a beat and multi-tracked harmonies, the song's instrumentation includes slow-bouncing keyboard tones, and drums. The song was written by Mendler and American songwriters Emanuel Kiriakou, Evan Kidd Bogart, and Andrew Goldstein, and produced by Kiriakou and Goldstein. Lyrically, the song gives ode to a disaster love, and reconciliation and perseverance in love. Mendler's vocals span from the low note of F\u2083 to the high note of F\u2085. In interview for Coup de Main Magazine, Mendler commented about recording a rap song for the first time. She said: \nI loved recording... you know the rap in 'Hurricane'? That was pretty fun. It was very experimental for me, I haven\u2019t done much rapping before. It was not a deliberate decision... we had written the song and I had come in to record it and then the guys were like: \"Why don\u2019t we just try rapping this part?\". So I did and then it kind of just worked and we decided to keep it. So not intentional, but sometimes things just happen in the moment.\nThe song received critical acclaim upon release. Tim Sendra of AllMusic said, \"[Hurricane] has clever fairy tale lyrics and an impassioned vocal (and a sassy rap section).\" Girls' Life magazine stated \"[Mendler] brings the beat in 'Hurricane', where she belts out some sweet raps about being in the middle of a stormy relationship.\" Kai of Embrace You magazine claimed that the track title was \"quite ironic when we\u2019re currently experiencing one of mother nature\u2019s conception of the said thing\" and later said that \"interestingly enough, I love this song. The acoustic opener caught me instantly and I\u2019m addicted to her 'oh, oh, oh\u2026' The singer\u2019s play on natural disasters as metaphors for the way she feels about her love interest once again showcases how witty she is as an artist.

It was released on April 12, 2013. Naomi Scott appears as Mendler's best friend in the video. They previously worked together in the 2011 Disney Channel film Lemonade Mouth.\nThe song was performed in all dates of her tour, Bridgit Mendler: Live in Concert. On October 20, 2012, Mendler performed the song on Radio Disney and Disney Channel webshow Total Access. The first television performance was on March 11, 2013 on Live! with Kelly and Michael.

Mendler performed \"Hurricane\" on Today and on Nova FM on August 30, 2013. During an exclusive interview with the Grammy Awards website, she performed \"Hurricane\" along with \"Ready or Not\".\nIn April 2013, Mendler recorded a series of four videos which were released to Vevo and YouTube entitled The Hurricane Sessions, and are acoustic performances of two songs from Hello My Name Is... and two covers. On May 8, 2013, the first video, \"Starry Eyed\", an Ellie Goulding cover, was released. It received positive reviews. Sam Lansky of Idolator commented, \"[Mendler's] husky voice works nicely with the song, especially toward the end, as it gets a little more emotive.\" On May 15, 2013, she released the second song, \"Locked Out of Heaven\", a Bruno Mars cover.

It was released on June 4, 2012, as the lead single from their debut self-titled studio album. The music video was released on March 11, 2012. \"Ho Hey\" reached number one for 18 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Rock Songs chart, as well as two weeks in the top spot on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and eight weeks in the top spot on the Adult Pop Songs chart, and reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming their first single to do so, as well as their first top 5 single. It also reached number 2 on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart, behind \"Locked Out of Heaven\" by Bruno Mars. It is also their first single to be certified in the US.\nThe song was originally created during Schultz and Fraites' time in New York as a kiss-off to disinterested concert-goers. \"That song was an effort to get under people's skin at shows in Brooklyn, where everyone is pretty indifferent,\" Schultz told American Songwriter. \"And I figured if we could punctuate it with shouts we might get someone's attention.\"\n\"Ho Hey\" is written in the key of C major. A McIntosh MC240 amplifier was used in the recording.\nThe song became a commercial success and was a breakthrough hit for the Lumineers. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 90 on the week of June 10, 2012. From there, it became a sleeper hit, slowly ascending the chart until it broke into the top ten in the week of November 10, 2012 at number eight and continued to climb until it reached its peak of number 3 in its 28th week on the chart. It also remained in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks, and topped Billboard's Rock Songs chart for 14 weeks. It has also sold over four million copies in the United States as of April 2013.\nThe song also became a crossover hit, topping the Adult Pop Songs, Rock Songs, Alternative Songs, and Triple A charts and reaching number two on the Pop Songs chart, topped only by Bruno Mars' \"Locked Out of Heaven\". It also charted on the Adult Contemporary and Country Airplay charts. This multi-format success allowed it to reach number two on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and stay on the Hot 100 for 62 weeks, one of the longest chart runs ever. On the Billboard Decade-End list on Hot 100 songs in the 2010s, released on November 15, 2019, it was the lowest-ranked song in the top 100 peaking at 100. It was behind number 99, which was \"Wrecking Ball\" by Miley Cyrus, followed by \"In My Feelings\" by Drake and \"Break Your Heart\" by Taio Cruz featuring Ludacris.\nThe song also had international success, reaching the top ten in the UK, Canada, Ireland, France, Israel, Italy, Slovakia, New Zealand, Australia, and Switzerland.\n\"Ho Hey\" has received positive reviews from critics. Anne Erickson of Audio Ink Radio gave the song a rating of 4 out of 5, favorably comparing Wesley Schultz's lead vocals on the song to Raine Maida. Erickson went on to say that \"it's darn refreshing to sit back and take in some genuine, straightforward music that comes from the heart\". Rolling Stone named the song the 26th-best song of 2012.\nThe music video for \"Ho Hey\" was released on March 11, 2012. The video was directed by Ben Fee. The video shows the band walking down a hall in the former Linda Vista Hospital while singing and dancing to the song.\nPrior to its release, \"Ho Hey\" was first featured on the December 5, 2011, episode of Hart of Dixie. Later on, the song was used in a television commercial for Bing on June 1, 2012.\nIn the UK, the song has been used in an advertisement for E.ON, in the final episode of sitcom Cuckoo as well as advertisements for the film Silver Linings Playbook.\nA purely instrumental version has been used in a commercial for Blue Moon beer.\nThe song appears as a playable track in the video game Guitar Hero Live.\n\"Ho Hey\" appears in the premiere episode of the eighth season of Bones, \"The Future in the Past\", which aired September 17, 2012.\nThe song appears in the fifth episode of the tenth season of The X-Files, \"Babylon\", which aired February 15, 2016.\nReferenced in the lyrics, Canal and Bowery are cross streets in lower Manhattan, New York City, NY where bus services arrive and depart from different parts of the U.S.\nThe song appeared in The Vampire Diaries season four episode three \"The Rager\", introducing the character Hayley Marshall.\nIn the sixteenth episode of the first season of Nashville, the characters Maddie and Daphne Conrad covered \"Ho Hey\". This version, credited to the actors' real names Lennon and Maisy Stella, debuted at number 58 on Country Airplay dated for the week of April 27, 2013, and peaked at 47. Blog"

It was later sent to contemporary hit radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists in the United States on 24 April 2012.\nMTV Buzzworthy wrote that the song's composition is a \"sugary sweet pop record [that] kind of reminds us a bit [of] Jessie J's 'Domino' and Katy Perry's 'Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)', but mixed with some dope\".\nThe song received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Djbooth.net wrote \"The Runners juxtaposing a pop-rock guitar with bass-booming reverb-drenched percussion as the singer/songwriter encourages listeners to let go of their cares and paint the town red. An eminently catchy ode to revelry and young love\". MTV Buzzworthy described the song as \"a power-pop punch of guitar strumming goodness\". Idolator gave the song a mixed review, writing that it is \"much less Rihanna-esque [than 'R.I.P.'], so there's hope. (\u2026) [but] she sounds a mix of Jessie J and Karmin here\".\n\"How We Do (Party)\" debuted on the New Zealand Singles Chart at number eight on 14 May 2012.

It's definitely [about embracing] anyone who wants to come to a party.\" The video premiered on Ora's official Vevo account on 17 April"

The song was produced by West, Jon Brion, and Devo Springsteen. The producers, with the exception of Brion, are credited as songwriters alongside John Barry and Don Black, who both received credit due to their composition being sampled. The song was initially centered around West's group of friends, though was later re-recorded once he learned about blood diamonds in Sierra Leone. West premiered the song for Hot 97 on April 20, 2005, before it was sent to US mainstream radio stations the following month as the album's lead single, through Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam.\nA hip hop song, \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\" features a sample of \"Diamonds Are Forever\", performed by Shirley Bassey. Lyrically, it sees West connect his material wealth to Sierra Leone's blood diamonds and the resulting civil war. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who mostly complimented West's lyricism. They often emphasized the rapper's focus on his status, while some critics praised the sampling of \"Diamonds Are Forever\". The song was awarded Best Rap Song at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards and won one of the Pop Awards at the 2006 BMI London Awards, before being named by Slant Magazine as among the best singles of the 2000s decade.\nIn the United States, the song peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 21 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in 2005. \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\" reached number eight in the United Kingdom, alongside attaining top 20 positions in Denmark, Finland, Ireland, and Norway. It has since been certified platinum and silver in the US and the UK by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI), respectively. An accompanying black and white music video was released on June 15, 2005. In the video, scenes of children experiencing rough diamond mining in Sierra Leone are displayed, being accompanied at points by a De Beers commercial and cuts of West wandering around Prague. It received a nomination for Outstanding Music Video at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards Japan. West performed the song at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Glastonbury Festival in 2006 and 2015, respectively.\nA remix of \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\", featuring Jay-Z, was sent to US radio stations by Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam on June 15, 2005. The remix also samples Bassey's \"Diamonds Are Forever\" and sees Jay-Z rapping in the second part. Lyrically, it includes references to deaths of civilians in blood diamond mines and tension around consumerism. The remix garnered mostly positive responses from critics; they commonly appreciated the subject matter and some commended Jay-Z's appearance. It was ranked amongst best-of lists by multiple publications, including Dagsavisen and Rockdelux in 2005. West and Jay-Z performed the remix at the 2005 Summer Jam.\nAmerican record producer and composer Jon Brion had achieved fame from his distinctive production work for artists and film scores for auteurs, though was lacking experience in hip hop. West became a fan of singer-songwriter Fiona Apple whom Brion had produced for; while watching 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, he appreciated Brion's score. The pair became connected via their mutual friend Rick Rubin; West quickly phoned Brion and they instantly formed chemistry with each other. West enlisted him to work on Late Registration, marking Brion's first involvement in a hip hop project; the decision created confused reactions across his fanbase. Brion imagined people commenting that West has \"gone off his rocker\" and envisioning him making \"an art record with some crazy, left-field music guy\", clarifying this not to be \"the case whatsoever\". The producer recalled West taking charge of production with his strong vision and mentioned the rapper's \"quick, intuitive decisions\". Filmmaker Michel Gondry worked on \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\" due to being in a studio where Brion had set up a drum kit one day.\nThe song's production was handled by West, Brion, and Devo Springsteen, all of whom co-wrote it apart from Brion.

The song contains additional vocals from Young Jeezy and Connie Mitchell. It was produced by West with DJ Toomp and West was responsible for 60 percent of the production, while the latter of the two contributed 40 percent. The song originated from Young Jeezy's \"I Got Money\", after West made changes to the track. On May 15, 2007, the song premiered via Hot 97 and was released by Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam that same day as the lead single from the album. A hip hop track, it was described by West as a theme song for the people. The lyrics see West reflecting on his fame while he expresses different types of feelings.\n\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" received universal acclaim from music critics, who mostly appreciated the lyrical content. Others praised the production, while some critics highlighted the song's inclusion on Graduation. It was listed amongst the best tracks of 2007 by several publications, including Consequence of Sound and Pitchfork. The song received a nomination for Best Rap Song at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, ultimately losing to \"Good Life\".

It sees West walking around El Mirage Lake unaccompanied, while his silhouette follows him. The video received positive reviews from critics, often being complemented for its camera work. The song's alternate music video was released on July 25, 2007, which features Zach Galifianakis and Will Oldham lip-syncing \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" at Galifianakis' farm. West performed the song live throughout 2007 and 2008, including at a Live Earth concert in the former year. He later performed it at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Glastonbury Festival in 2011 and 2015, respectively.\n\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" was used in the film The Hangover (2009), marking the first of three times that West's music was featured in the films from the series of the same name. In 2013, West named it his favourite song out of his entire discography. Francis and the Lights covered the song in 2009, and an acoustic cover version was later performed by Taking Back Sunday in 2011. The song's Young Jeezy-featuring remix was released in July 2007, which contains a verse from him.\nFollowing on from meeting West when working on rapper T.I.'s second studio album Trap Muzik (2003), record producer DJ Toomp went to New York and joined West in the studio for the creation of Graduation. West showed a high amount of respect for him and was using an Ensoniq ASR-10 keyboard in the studio, which DJ Toomp said \"is the same keyboard I've been using since day one.\" Speaking of the two of them collaborating for the album, he opined that \"it definitely felt like a team atmosphere\" and also \"felt like, 'we.'\" DJ Toomp admitted that he \"would say that sixty percent of 'Can't Tell Me Nothing' was Ye, and forty me,\" while he called West \"a mastermind.\" In an interview with Revolt, DJ Toomp explained that his 40 percent of the song's production was the beat and bassline, while the 60 percent contributed by West consisted of the strings and the \"oh-oh-ah-oh-ah-oh\" backing vocals. He revealed that the song was originally supposed to be a remix of West's Def Jam labelmate Young Jeezy's song \"I Got Money\", since West loved \"the whole cadence of how that beat was flowing\" and \"wanted the song to be a remix featuring him.\" However, Young Jeezy ultimately \"wasn't really feeling it\" according to DJ Toomp, which led to the song being passed on to West.\nYoung Jeezy also offered an explanation of how \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" came from \"I Got Money\" during an interview with HipHopDX, saying that it was supposed to be a collaboration between him and T.I. for the former's third studio album The Recession (2008).

The track was released as an A-side in the UK in 1976, as \"Benny and the Jets\".\nIt is ranked number 371 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\nThe song tells of \"Bennie and the Jets\", a fictional band of whom the song's narrator is a fan. In interviews, Taupin has said that the song's lyrics are a satire on the music industry of the 1970s. The greed and glitz of the early 1970s music scene is portrayed by Taupin's words:\nWe'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around,\nyou're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound.\nTaupin also goes on to describe the flashy wardrobe of \"Bennie\", the leader of the band:\nShe's got electric boots, a mohair suit\nYou know I read it in a magazine Ohh...\nProduced by Gus Dudgeon, the song was recorded during the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road sessions in France at Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville's Strawberry Studios, where John and Taupin had recorded their previous two albums, Honky Ch\u00e2teau and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player.\nJohn rarely plays the studio version of the song, and often makes subtle or even drastic changes. Live, the piano solo in the middle of the song has been played in all sorts of variations, from very close to the original to wildly improvised and extended versions, such as the elaborate version during a Central Park concert in 1980 and another memorable take on it during the \"Elton and his band\" part of the show recorded for what would become Live in Australia in December 1986. (It can be seen on various Laserdisc releases of the show.) He has also been known to end the song in a wide range of styles, including classical, swing, boogie-woogie and even using the signature five-note phrase from John Williams' score for Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\nDespite sounding as though recorded live, the song was actually recorded in studio, with live sound effects added in later. Producer Gus Dudgeon explained:\nFor some weird reason, Elton happened to have hit the opening piano chord of the song exactly one bar before the song actually started. So I was doing the mix and this chord kept coming on which you normally wouldn't expect to hear. I turned to engineer [David Hentschel] and I said, \u2018What does that remind you of? \u2026 It's the sort of thing that people do on stage just before they're going to start a song.\u2019 Just to kind of get everybody, \u2018Okay, here we go, ready?\u2019 For some reason that chord being there made me think, \u2018Maybe we should fake-live this.\u2019\nHe mixed in sounds from a 1972 performance of John in Royal Festival Hall and a 1970 Jimi Hendrix concert at the Isle of Wight. He also included a series of whistles from a live concert in Vancouver, and added hand claps and various shouts.\nThe song was the closing track on side one of the album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and John was set against releasing it as a single, believing it would fail. CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, began heavy airplay of the song and it became the #1 song in the Detroit market. This attention caused other American and Canadian Top 40 stations to add it to their playlists as well. As a result, the song peaked at #1 on the US singles chart in 1974. In the US, it was certified Gold on 8 April 1974 and Platinum on 13 September 1995 by the RIAA, and had sold 2.8 million copies by August 1976.\n\"Bennie and the Jets\" was also John's first Top 40 hit on what at the time was called the Billboard Hot Soul Singles chart, where it peaked at #15, the highest position out of the three of his singles which reached that chart. The acceptance of \"Bennie\" on R&B radio helped land John, a huge soul music fan, a guest appearance on the 17 May 1975 edition of Soul Train, where he played \"Bennie and the Jets\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom\". In Canada, it held the #1 spot on the RPM national singles chart for two weeks (13\u201320 April), becoming his"

Composed by Elton John, with lyrics by Tim Rice, the song was performed by Carmen Twillie (the deep female lead vocals) and Lebo M. (opening vocals in Zulu) as the film's opening song. In an interview, Rice said he was amazed at the speed with which John composed: \"I gave him the lyrics at the beginning of the session at about two in the afternoon. By half-past three, he'd finished writing and recording a stunning demo.\" Elton John sang a pop version (with alternative lyrics) of the song with the London Community Gospel Choir, which was included in the film's soundtrack and made into a music video.\n\"Circle of Life\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1994, along with two other songs from The Lion King: \"Hakuna Matata\" and \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\", the latter of which won the award. \"Circle of Life\" was also nominated for a Song of the Year Grammy. The song reached No. 11 in the UK and No. 18 in the US and is featured frequently in attractions based on The Lion King, such as Disney theme parks and parades. Michael Crawford sang it as part of a medley for The Disney Album in 2001.\nThe song was featured in Disney's 2019 photorealistic computer-animated remake of The Lion King and was used in the first trailer of the film, a near shot-for-shot remake of the opening of the original animated film. This new version of the song was performed by Brown Lindiwe Mkhize, the actress who performed as Rafiki in the stage adaptation of the movie in London from 2005 to 2018. However, the new version also retains the original Zulu opening vocals by Lebo M. from the 1994 film.\n\nIn the theatrical adaptation, the opening sequence is noticeably different from the opening of the film. For example, the song is sung by Rafiki instead of an off-screen female narrator.\nWith the sun rising over the Pride Lands, Rafiki commences the start of the production by singing the opening chant of the song and summoning the animals of the Pride Lands for the presentation of baby Simba. As the first two verses of the musical number end, a representation of Pride Rock appears on stage carrying its two reigning rulers, Sarabi cradling the small puppet representing her son in her arms with Mufasa alongside her. As the choir chants excitedly in the background, Rafiki accompanies the monarch and his consort to the top of Pride Rock to bless the cub before raising him high in the air, singing joyfully alongside the chorus as the gathered animals bow before their new prince.\nAt the end of Act II, Simba's friends and family acknowledge him as the rightful king after Scar's defeat. Rafiki crowns Simba with the mantle of kingship after his victory and Simba ascends Pride Rock. There he gives a mighty roar which echoes across the whole kingdom, and the animals come back to the Pride Lands to recognise and salute Simba as the rightful king. The musical ends as Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to all of the animals, followed by a blackout that finishes Act II and leads to the curtain call at the end of the performance.\nThe assembly of animals that appear are slightly different from the beginning of Act I. There are no wildebeests or adult elephant, only two zebras instead of three, nine gazelles instead of twelve, and half of the bird performers instead of four. Only the baby elephant, the rhino, the giraffes, three cranes, the cheetah, and the birds appear as poles on cranes as kites.\nThe song was re-recorded in 2003 by the Disney Channel Circle of Stars, a group of actors and actresses who have appeared in Disney Channel television series and original movies, for the album Disneymania 2.  The line-up was significantly different when their next rerecording, \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\", was released two years later.\nIn 2017 American boyband"

It was released alongside the official music video on September 18, 2020, as the lead single off Bieber's sixth studio album, Justice. The single marks the pair's fifth collaboration following \"Confident\" (2013), \"Juke Jam\" (2016) and featured appearances on \"I'm the One\" (2017) and \"No Brainer\" (2018). \"Holy\" is a pop song with elements of gospel. Billboard named it the 41st best song of 2020. The acoustic version was released on November 6, 2020.\nThe official video was released on September 18, 2020, and features Bieber as a laid-off oil worker and his partner being helped by a charitable soldier.\nBieber's fifth studio album Changes was released on Valentine's day, the 14th of February 2020. On September 15, 2020, Bieber tweeted that his new single \"Holy\" would be released in a few days to signify his next musical \"era\". Lyrically, the song is about Bieber's love for his wife Hailey Bieber and his love of God. \"Holy\" discusses themes of loyalty and faith, with The New York Times calling it \"devotional R&B\".\nBieber and Chance had previously worked on several songs together, with \"Holy\" marking their fifth collaboration. In terms of the lyrical content, both Bieber and Chance are Christians as well as songwriter Jon Bellion.\nJon Bellion earlier performed it at a VIP concert event saying that it will be released later in the year. Bellion's fans would begin to beg for it and eventually get it released by Bieber and Chance The Rapper, whom Jon would work with knowing they would reach a broader audience and more ears overall.\n\"Holy\" is a pop song, composed in G-flat major with a tempo of 88 beats per minute.\nBieber performed a live version of the song on Saturday Night Live on October 17, 2020. He performed the song again at the 2020 People's Choice Awards in November.\nThe acoustic version of the song was released on November 6.\nA charity version of the song was released on December 18. This version featured the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir, who had got to the top of the UK Christmas singles chart in 2015 with their charity release \"A Bridge over You\", a chart which saw Bieber at number two with \"Love Yourself\". \"Holy\" was an early contender for the 2020 UK Christmas number one in the UK. However, when the new version was released on 18 December 2020, it still had a credit for Chance the Rapper, like the original version which first entered the UK chart on 25 September 2020. As the new record was seen as just a remix, \"Holy\" ended up at Number 41 in the Christmas chart with 17,594 sales, after being classed as per the original release with a lower chart ratio.\nNME rated the song 3/5 stars, and drew similarities to Kanye West's gospel music. Stereogum criticized the song's bland lyrics and execution, writing, \"Being madly in love with your spouse is good; it\u2019s just that the Justin Bieber songs about being madly in love with your spouse are bad.\"\n\n\"Holy\" debuted at number one on the Canadian Hot 100 issued for October\u00a03, 2020. Music Canada certified the song 2\u00d7 Platinum. On the US Billboard Hot 100, it debuted and peaked at number three; it earned a Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which denotes one million units based on sales and track-equivalent on-demand streams. \"Holy\" reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart, and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it Gold. In Australia, the song charted at number four and went 2\u00d7 Platinum. It peaked at number two in New Zealand and received a Platinum certification. \"Holy\" reached the top 10 of national record charts, at number two in Ireland, number three in the Netherlands, Norway, number five in Singapore, Sweden, number six in the Czech Republic, Malaysia, number seven in Denmark, number eight in Poland, number nine in Scotland, and number 10 in Austria, Hungary, Switzerland. The song received a Gold certification in Belgium, Norway.\nThe music video for \"Holy\" was released the same day as the song, September 18, 2020. It was directed by Colin Tilley and stars Wilmer Valderrama and Ryan Destiny. The video follows Bieber, a recently laid off oil worker, and Destiny as a couple who meet a helpful soldier played by Valderrama. The video has been interpreted as a commentary on the Just Transition. As of January 14, 2021, the"

It was released on January 3, 2020, along with a lyric video through Def Jam Recordings, as the lead single from his fifth studio album, Changes. The song is Bieber's first single as a solo artist to be released in almost four years, following his March 2016 single, \"Company\", a song from his 2015 album Purpose. Bieber joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok on the day of the song's release.\n\"Yummy\" received mixed reviews from music critics, some of whom complimented on Bieber's vocal performance while others criticized the song's production, its songwriting, and Bieber's delivery. The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, while reaching the top five in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and various other countries, and hitting number one in New Zealand. The song's official music video was released on January 4, 2020.\nThe song was first teased by Bieber on October 27, 2019, when he took to Instagram to tease the title of the song by drawing it on a piece of paper. The song's genre which he dubbed \u201cR&BIEBER\u201d was also teased on the following day with another post uploaded onto his Instagram account.\nOn December 23, 2019, Bieber teased the release by posting a picture of himself in front of a piano accompanied by two posts with the caption \"tomorrow\". The following day, he announced the single via a trailer he uploaded to YouTube that shows him walking through an abandoned gas station. The trailer also serves as an announcement for his upcoming North American tour starting May 14, 2020, as well as a documentary covering \"all different stories\". About the upcoming music, Bieber stated that \"I believe that I am right where I\u2019m supposed to be and God has me right where he wants me\", and that he feels like \"this is different than the previous albums just because of where I'm at in my life\".\nOn the release day of \"Yummy\", Bieber joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok and posted a video of himself lip-syncing to the song, and encouraged his fans to do so, as well. Four days later, Bieber released autographed limited editions of \"Yummy\", including a cassette, a seven-inch picture disc, six unique CDs and five unique seven-inch vinyl discs, available for only 24 hours. Bieber released five additional music videos for the song, titled: \"Animated Version\", \"x drew house, Animated Version\", \"Beliebers React\", \"Fan Lip Sync\" and \"Food Fight\", and \"TikTok Compilation Video\" and launched an official \"Yummy\" online game.\n\"Yummy\" is a \"straightforward R&B number\" that moves along on pop-trap beats. Bieber's vocals span from F\u2084 to the high B\u266d\u2085. The song contains a \"crisp bass line and plinking keyboards\". Bieber rap-sings the pre-chorus, while he hits his \"signature falsetto\" in the bridge. Bryan Rolli of Forbes magazine called the chorus \"seductive\", albeit \"meaningless\". The song is considered an ode to Bieber's wife, Hailey Bieber.\n\"Yummy\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Rania Aniftos of Billboard magazine said \"Yummy\" brings back \"the flirtatious Bieber we've missed and been waiting for\", describing the chorus as \"catchy\". Bryan Rolli, writing for Forbes, said that Bieber \"sings his heart out\" on the song and noted although \"the lyrics may not invite scholarly analysis ... Bieber sure does sound good singing them\". Rolli concluded calling the song a \"win, an inevitable chart smash\" and opined that it is \"sure to sound even better when 50,000 fans scream it every night on his upcoming tour\". In a later review, Rolli called the song \"mediocre\" which \"lacks the components of a smash hit.\" Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times described the song as \"a lithe little R&B number that faintly recalls Ginuwine's mid-'90s classic 'Pony' and basically three-and-a-half minutes of PG-13 sex talk seemingly directed at Hailey Baldwin\". He stated that \"though it's very cute, 'Yummy' feels awfully lightweight for a single that has as much hanging on it as this one does\" and added that the song \"loses much of its flavor after only a few spins\". Brad Callas of Complex magazine listed \"Yummy\" amongst the best new music of the week and said Bieber's \"pivot back to R&B is refreshing for those who were fans of his slept-on 2013 project,\u00a0Journals\". Callas further remarked that the \"silky vocals\" is at times reminiscent of Bieber's 2016 collaboration with Post Malone, \"Deja Vu\". NME's Sam Moore complimented the song's R&B production, but dismissed the lyrics,"

It is the seventh track on the band's fourth studio album, Ixnay on the Hombre (1997), and was released as its second single. It also appears as the sixth track on Greatest Hits (2005). A piano version of the song features as the eleventh track on the group's tenth studio album Let The Bad Times Roll  (2021). \nThe song became the Offspring's first No. 1 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, while reaching No. 4 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. Through 2009, the band played \"Gone Away\" with Holland performing on piano throughout Europe and the United States. Two of the tracks from this single (\"D.U.I.\" and \"Hey Joe\") appear on the band's 2010 compilation album, Happy Hour!.\n\nAll tracks are written by Dexter Holland, except where noted.\n\n\nThe single reached Gold in Australia, selling 35,000 copies.\nThe footage for the music video, shot in grainy quality, shows the band playing in a dark, and apparently abandoned slaughterhouse. Dexter Holland, for most of the video, sings to a shining hanging light bulb. He is the only band member to interact with this bulb, though other lightbulbs are shown in each band member's respective rooms. Dexter also sings into a suspended microphone which is also used in the video; it swings back and forth as the video fades to black. It was directed by Nigel Dick.\nThe music video appears on the Complete Music Video Collection DVD, released in 2005. The DVD also contains a storyboard version of the video (with the storyboard playing over top the music video).\nThe song was made available as downloadable content in the Rock Band series on October 7, 2008. It appeared in the first Offspring pack along with \"Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)\" and \"Self Esteem\".\n\n\n\n\nFive Finger Death Punch covered the song on their 2017 compilation album, A Decade of Destruction, and on their 2018 studio album, And Justice for None. Their version peaked at No. 2 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Airplay chart in April 2018.\n\"79 Best Alternative Rock Songs of 1997\". Spin. April 25, 2017. p.\u00a02.

It was released on January 3, 2020, along with a lyric video through Def Jam Recordings, as the lead single from his fifth studio album, Changes. The song is Bieber's first single as a solo artist to be released in almost four years, following his March 2016 single, \"Company\", a song from his 2015 album Purpose. Bieber joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok on the day of the song's release.\n\"Yummy\" received mixed reviews from music critics, some of whom complimented on Bieber's vocal performance while others criticized the song's production, its songwriting, and Bieber's delivery. The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, while reaching the top five in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and various other countries, and hitting number one in New Zealand. The song's official music video was released on January 4, 2020.\nThe song was first teased by Bieber on October 27, 2019, when he took to Instagram to tease the title of the song by drawing it on a piece of paper. The song's genre which he dubbed \u201cR&BIEBER\u201d was also teased on the following day with another post uploaded onto his Instagram account.\nOn December 23, 2019, Bieber teased the release by posting a picture of himself in front of a piano accompanied by two posts with the caption \"tomorrow\". The following day, he announced the single via a trailer he uploaded to YouTube that shows him walking through an abandoned gas station. The trailer also serves as an announcement for his upcoming North American tour starting May 14, 2020, as well as a documentary covering \"all different stories\". About the upcoming music, Bieber stated that \"I believe that I am right where I\u2019m supposed to be and God has me right where he wants me\", and that he feels like \"this is different than the previous albums just because of where I'm at in my life\".\nOn the release day of \"Yummy\", Bieber joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok and posted a video of himself lip-syncing to the song, and encouraged his fans to do so, as well. Four days later, Bieber released autographed limited editions of \"Yummy\", including a cassette, a seven-inch picture disc, six unique CDs and five unique seven-inch vinyl discs, available for only 24 hours. Bieber released five additional music videos for the song, titled: \"Animated Version\", \"x drew house, Animated Version\", \"Beliebers React\", \"Fan Lip Sync\" and \"Food Fight\", and \"TikTok Compilation Video\" and launched an official \"Yummy\" online game.\n\"Yummy\" is a \"straightforward R&B number\" that moves along on pop-trap beats. Bieber's vocals span from F\u2084 to the high B\u266d\u2085. The song contains a \"crisp bass line and plinking keyboards\". Bieber rap-sings the pre-chorus, while he hits his \"signature falsetto\" in the bridge. Bryan Rolli of Forbes magazine called the chorus \"seductive\", albeit \"meaningless\". The song is considered an ode to Bieber's wife, Hailey Bieber.\n\"Yummy\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Rania Aniftos of Billboard magazine said \"Yummy\" brings back \"the flirtatious Bieber we've missed and been waiting for\", describing the chorus as \"catchy\". Bryan Rolli, writing for Forbes, said that Bieber \"sings his heart out\" on the song and noted although \"the lyrics may not invite scholarly analysis ... Bieber sure does sound good singing them\". Rolli concluded calling the song a \"win, an inevitable chart smash\" and opined that it is \"sure to sound even better when 50,000 fans scream it every night on his upcoming tour\". In a later review, Rolli called the song \"mediocre\" which \"lacks the components of a smash hit.\" Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times described the song as \"a lithe little R&B number that faintly recalls Ginuwine's mid-'90s classic 'Pony' and basically three-and-a-half minutes of PG-13 sex talk seemingly directed at Hailey Baldwin\". He stated that \"though it's very cute, 'Yummy' feels awfully lightweight for a single that has as much hanging on it as this one does\" and added that the song \"loses much of its flavor after only a few spins\". Brad Callas of Complex magazine listed \"Yummy\" amongst the best new music of the week and said Bieber's \"pivot back to R&B is refreshing for those who were fans of his slept-on 2013 project,\u00a0Journals\". Callas further remarked that the \"silky vocals\" is at times reminiscent of Bieber's 2016 collaboration with Post Malone, \"Deja Vu\". NME's Sam Moore complimented the song's R&B production, but dismissed the lyrics,"

It was released as the first single from her debut solo album, Deadline for My Memories. Written by Martin and David Harrow, it is known to be one of her most notable singles. It was produced by English electronic dance group the Grid and was originally released on 31 October 1994. The track found greater chart success in 1995, when it peaked at number one in Italy and on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs and number 6 on the UK Singles Chart. On the Eurochart Hot 100, \"Your Loving Arms\" reached number 21. There were made two different music videos for the song. In 1996, Mixmag ranked it at number 47 in its 100 Greatest Dance Singles Of All Time list.\n\"Your Loving Arms\" received favorable reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor John Bush described it as a \"magical\" electro-pop track. On the 1994 release, Larry Flick from Billboard called it \"a spirited foray into trancecarpeted hi-NRG territory. Her distinctively creamy voice has seldom sounded so strong and worldly, giving the song's romantic prose a decidedly dark and anxious edge.\" In 1995, he added it as \"an NRGetic dance number that makes excellent use of her milky soprano range. Her torchy style makes an intriguing contrast with the Grid's cool and rigid groove production.\" He also called it \"deliciously dramatic\". Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report said that \"there's something in Billie Ray's voice that is simply magnetic. This one-time member of London's Electribe 101 releases a lot of electricity on her own as proven by one super hot dance track.\" Ross Jones from The Guardian complimented the singer as the \"owner of this era's most haunting voice\". He wrote, \"At first, this high-octane disco spinner doesn't seem like the best place for her Marlene-meets-Aretha tones, but listen closely and try imagining anyone else caressing it so lovingly, with such unassailable cool.\" On the re-release, he called it a \"glowing piece of dancefloor TNT\". \nJohn Hamilton from Idolator described it as \"fiery\" and \"a predestined club classic, a pulsating techno torch song in which Martin sasses, vamps, and pleads over ominous rising chords and a frantic tambourine-inflected beat.\" Howard Cohen from Knight Ridder said that \"an instantly memorable hook, retro-disco beat and warm, inviting vocals make this the most musical dance offering 1995 has offered so far.\" Music writer James Masterton commented, \"Her first solo hit is more of what she has become known for, a haunting, slinky piece of dance music that is so good as to be utterly uncommercial.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote, \"Is there such a thing as adult-orientated pop dance? If there isn't yet, then it is debuting right here thanks to a lady who looks like Marianne Faithfull's twin sister with the voice of Carly Simon.\" James Hamilton from Music Week's RM Dance Update deemed it \"mournful\" and \"husky\". Barry Walters from Spin stated that it \"was the pop song with underground credibility, one that everyone could agree had something special. Martin's lyrics speak of profound joy and pain, the melody soars through consciousness like a caress, and the vocal sets itself apart from the wailing of generic gut-busting divas.\"\n\"Your Loving Arms\" was a major hit in Europe and remains Ray Martin's most successful song to date. It went to number-one in Italy and was a Top 10 hit in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 6 in its second week on the UK Singles Chart, on May 21, 1995. But on the UK Dance Chart, the single reached number 2. On the Eurochart Hot 100, \"Your Loving Arms\" peaked at number 21 on June 3, 1995. Outside Europe, it hit number-one on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs, number 5 in Israel and number 85 in Australia in November 1995. Additionally, the single also went to number 46 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 30 on the US Cash Box singles chart in 1996. It received a silver record in the United Kingdom with a sale of 200,000 singles.\nThere were made two different music videos for the song. The UK version is in black-and-white and features Ray Martin performing the song in a bedroom, sometimes lying on the bed or sitting in a chair. Other scenes features the singer walking in a garden or dancing with a man in a hallway. The second version is in colours. The UK version was uploaded to YouTube in 2014.\nBritish electronic and clubbing magazine Mixmag listed the song at number 47 in its"

It was written by Lavigne, Kroeger and David Hodges. The song was released on 15 October 2013, by Epic Records, as the third single of Avril Lavigne. It is Lavigne's first single to feature a guest performer.\nCritics gave the piano-driven power ballad mixed reviews, with some calling it \"a monster duet\", and others criticizing Kroeger's vocals and his involvement in the track.\nA music video was released on 15 October 2013, and it shows Lavigne roaming the halls of an abandoned mansion, with Kroeger's appearance being channeled through an elderly yardman, only to be seen as his true self through mirrored and tablet-assisted images. The song debuted at number 37 on the US Billboard Adult Pop Songs chart and at number 78 on Billboard Hot 100. It has also debuted and peaked at number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100, after charting in three airplay formats and debuting at number 7 on the Canadian Digital Songs chart. The music video has reached over 100 million views on Vevo as of October 2016.\n\"Let Me Go\" was released as the third single from Lavigne's self-titled fifth studio album on 15 October 2013, after the release of the first two singles, \"Here's to Never Growing Up\" and \"Rock N Roll\". Lavigne described it as a piano ballad and one of her favorite songs from Avril Lavigne. \"Let Me Go\" features vocals from Lavigne's husband, Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger, whom she married in July 2013. The song was first written in March 2013 and was originally going to be about letting go of someone, but after Lavigne's and Kroeger's relationship started growing, they rewrote the last chorus to reflect it.\nThe song premiered on 8 October 2013, 8:30 AM (PST) at KBIG 1043 MYfm and has been released on the iTunes Store a week later on 15 October 2013.\n\"Let Me Go\" was written by Avril Lavigne, Chad Kroeger and David Hodges, with production being handled by Kroeger, who also provided guest vocals, and Hodges. It is a \"piano-tinged\" pop rock ballad. Carl Williott of Idolator highlighting \"the most obnoxious aspects of Avril\u2019s snotty pop and Chad\u2019s rock-by-numbers mookery can breathe a sigh of relief.\" Its instrumentation features a piano, a string section, an acoustic drum kit, and electric guitars and bass. The song starts with Lavigne beginning in a relationship that's clearly past its prime, \"I'm breaking free from these memories/ Gotta let it go, just let it go/ I've said goodbye, set it all on fire,\". Chad's verse, \"You came back to find I was gone / And that place is empty, like the hole that was left in me\", brings a turn to the lyric's meanings. Now, the act of letting go of memories carries the promise of another beginning. \nThe song was written on the first day Lavigne started working with Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger on songwriting for her fifth album. They sat with writer and producer David Hodges (ex-Evanescence) and penned \"Let Me Go\". Ironically, the song started out as a breakup song. \"It was about letting go of someone and having them let go of you,\" Lavigne told Yahoo Music. After the song was finished, Kroeger and Lavigne did the very opposite of letting go: They continued to work together, and soon they discovered their chemistry was more than musical. After becoming a couple, the two continued to write and record together in the studio, with Kroeger co-writing 10 of 13 songs. But when the couple looked back at the first song they did together, \"Let Me Go,\" they decided the lyrical theme was no longer appropriate. \"After we were together we were both like, 'Okay, we're engaged and our duet together is a breakup song.'\" Lavigne said. \"It was kind of fucked up. So we changed it. We rewrote the last chorus to put a twist on it so we end up together. Therefore the message of the song is more the journey of love through one's life. Obviously I've been in other relationships. So it's like going from one stage in one love into finding the right one. It's kind of sweet.\"\nThe song has received mixed reviews. Critics overall praised the lyrics and Lavigne's performance, but criticized Kroeger's vocals and his seemingly \"unnecessary\" appearance. Cornelius Vernon-Boase of Soundscape Magazine wrote the song \"is a slower song and has a rock ballad feel with a powerful chorus,\""

It was released as the second single from Mauboy's second studio album, Get 'Em Girls, on 27 October 2010. The song was written by Angie Iron, Mauboy, Ludacris and Brian Kennedy, and was produced by Kennedy.\nMusically, \"Saturday Night\" is a dance-pop song that includes elements of electropop and techno in its instrumentation; it utilizes a synthesizer beat and heavy drums.

Mauboy also recorded a simlish version of the song titled, \"Surbiduh Nye\", for the video game, The Sims 3: Late Night.\n\"Saturday Night\" was written by Angie Iron, Brian Kennedy and Ludacris, with Kennedy also producing the track alongside Israel Cruz and Khaled Rohaim. The rap verse on the song was written by Ludacris. When Mauboy heard the original verse, she was not happy with it and had Ludacris re-write it again.\n\"Saturday Night\" is written using E minor, D, and C chords in its intro. It is a dance-pop tune which features instrumentation from both keyboard and drums, and uses a synthesized backing. Both Jessica Mauboy and Ludacris use auto-tune. Lyrically, the song is about Mauboy and her girlfriends getting ready to go to a party, and taking to the streets in their Aston Martin DB9. Ludacris's rap verse is somewhat more sexualized.\nMauboy also recorded a simlish version of the song re-titled, \"Surbiduh Nye\".

A second version of the video without a guest appearance from Ludacris, was released on 2 December 2010.\nThroughout the video, it shows tinted lighting and fast-paced graphics.

There are also intercut snippets of a DB9 driving swiftly along a highway with a license plate reading \"JP Logistics\", an anonymous dancer on a bar seat with curly hair, and city scenes including neon signage. Mauboy herself can be seen wearing a fox fur and dancing at a club with some girlfriends, while holding a glass of champagne, and a bottle of alcohol is also pictured. Ludacris makes a cameo appearance, raising his sunglasses to reveal himself in the beginning and illuminating the neon lighting with his hands in his rap solo.

It was written by American musician Prince using the pseudonym \"Christopher\" and was originally intended for the group Apollonia 6 in 1984. Lyrically, it describes a woman who is waking up to go to work on Monday, wishing it was still Sunday so she could continue relaxing.\nThe single, released by Columbia Records on Monday, January 27, 1986, received generally positive reviews from music critics and some comparisons with the Mamas & the Papas' \"Monday, Monday\". It became the Bangles' first hit, reaching No. 2 in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as in Austria, Canada, Germany, and Ireland, and peaked within the Top 5 in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland. It was later certified silver in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\nPrince wrote \"Manic Monday\" in 1984, and recorded it as a duet for the band Apollonia 6's self-titled album; however, he eventually pulled the song. Two years later, he offered the single to the Bangles under the pseudonym \"Christopher\", a character he played in the 1986 film Under the Cherry Moon. It was rumored by various writers that after Prince listened to the band's 1984 debut album All Over the Place, he gave the song to Bangles rhythm guitarist Susanna Hoffs, in hopes of winning her affection. Prince's original demo recording of the song would not be released until it appeared on the 2019 demo compilation Originals.\nIn an interview with MTV UK in 1989 Debbi Peterson explained why Prince gave them the song: \"[Prince] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher.\" Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: \"It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it.\"\nA pop song written in D major, \"Manic Monday\" moves at a tempo of 116 beats per minute and is set in common time. The song has a sequence of D\u2013A\u2087\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2087\u2013G as its chord progression. Lyrically, the song is about someone waking up from a romantic dream at six o'clock on Monday morning, and facing a hectic journey to work when she would prefer to still be enjoying relaxing on Sunday\u2014her \"I-don't-have-to-run day\". Actor Rudolph Valentino is referred in the first verse.\n\nSome critics compared the song with the single \"Monday, Monday\" by the band the Mamas & the Papas. In a review for AllMusic, Mark Deming said that the single \"was a far cry from anything the Bangles had recorded before\"; while Matthew Greenwald, also from the website, said\nIt's a clever and deceptively simple pop narrative, an infectious pop confection ... There is also an excellently written bridge that shows Prince/Christopher to be an excellent craftsman, and, to their credit, the Bangles carry it off with style and wit?\nRobert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times called the song \"a candidate for best single of the year\". The Guardian music critic Dorian Lynskey commented about the painful rhyming of \"Sunday\" with \"I-don't-have-to-run day.\"\nMark Moses from The Phoenix said \"the lack of lyrical substance is so glaring that Prince's lame 'Manic Monday' seems like a thematic highlight\". Greg Baker of The Miami News wrote in the album's review that \"the song should put the Bangles on the 'pop 'n' roll' map\". A writer in Toledo Blade noted that \"Manic Monday\" was \"infectious\" and,"

It was released in 1986 as the third single from the album Different Light.  It was the band's first number one single, being certified gold by the RIAA, and became Billboard's number-one song of 1987.\nLiam Sternberg, who wrote the song, had finished a demo version by January 1984 with singer Marti Jones. He offered it to Toni Basil, who turned it down. Lene Lovich recorded the first version of the song, but it went unreleased when she decided to take a break from music to raise her family. David Kahne from Peer Southern Publishing was the producer of Different Light; he received a copy of the demo and liked it, especially Jones's \"offhand quality\".\nKahne took the song to the Bangles, who agreed to record it. He had each member of the group sing the lyrics to determine who would sing each verse; Vicki Peterson, Michael Steele, and Susanna Hoffs sang lead vocals in the final version on the first, second, and third verses, respectively. Kahne particularly disliked Debbi Peterson's leads, so she was relegated to backing vocals. This angered her and caused tension within the group. The situation was exacerbated by the use of a drum machine in place of her drumming, further diminishing her role in the song. She can be seen playing the tambourine during their 1986 performance on The Old Grey Whistle Test. The whistling in the song was actually played by a machine.\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was released as the third single from Different Light. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1986. The song reached a peak of number three on the UK Singles Chart in November 1986 and reached number one in the US on December 20, staying at the top of the Hot 100 for four weeks, carrying it over into January 1987. The success of the song and \"Manic Monday\" propelled Different Light to number two on the Billboard 200 chart, making it the group's most successful album.\nThe music video for \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was nominated for Best Group Video at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards. It features both the Bangles performing the song at a concert and scenes of people dancing in  poses similar to those depicted in the Ancient Egyptian reliefs that inspired songwriter Liam Sternberg. Most of these people were filmed on the streets of New York City, although special effects were used to modify photos of Princess Diana, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and the Statue of Liberty. In a popular scene from the video, Hoffs was filmed in a close-up where her eyes moved from side to side, looking left and right. When asked about the scene in an interview, Hoffs explained that she was looking at individual audience members during the video shoot, which took place with a live audience. Looking directly at individual audience members was a technique she used to overcome stage fright, and she was unaware that the camera had a close-up on her while she was employing this technique, switching between one audience member on her left and one on her right.\nIn 1990, \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was re-issued as a single in the UK to promote the Bangles' Greatest Hits album. It featured new remixes for the song called Ozymandias Remix. It charted at number 73 in the UK.\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was one of the songs which were claimed to have been banned by Clear Channel following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Snopes in researching this found that the list was simply suggestions regarding songs to be sensitive about when deciding what to play.

It was written by American musician Prince using the pseudonym \"Christopher\" and was originally intended for the group Apollonia 6 in 1984. Lyrically, it describes a woman who is waking up to go to work on Monday, wishing it was still Sunday so she could continue relaxing.\nThe single, released by Columbia Records on Monday, January 27, 1986, received generally positive reviews from music critics and some comparisons with the Mamas & the Papas' \"Monday, Monday\". It became the Bangles' first hit, reaching No. 2 in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as in Austria, Canada, Germany, and Ireland, and peaked within the Top 5 in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland. It was later certified silver in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\nPrince wrote \"Manic Monday\" in 1984, and recorded it as a duet for the band Apollonia 6's self-titled album; however, he eventually pulled the song. Two years later, he offered the single to the Bangles under the pseudonym \"Christopher\", a character he played in the 1986 film Under the Cherry Moon. It was rumored by various writers that after Prince listened to the band's 1984 debut album All Over the Place, he gave the song to Bangles rhythm guitarist Susanna Hoffs, in hopes of winning her affection. Prince's original demo recording of the song would not be released until it appeared on the 2019 demo compilation Originals.\nIn an interview with MTV UK in 1989 Debbi Peterson explained why Prince gave them the song: \"[Prince] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher.\" Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: \"It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it.\"\nA pop song written in D major, \"Manic Monday\" moves at a tempo of 116 beats per minute and is set in common time. The song has a sequence of D\u2013A\u2087\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2087\u2013G as its chord progression. Lyrically, the song is about someone waking up from a romantic dream at six o'clock on Monday morning, and facing a hectic journey to work when she would prefer to still be enjoying relaxing on Sunday\u2014her \"I-don't-have-to-run day\". Actor Rudolph Valentino is referred in the first verse.\n\nSome critics compared the song with the single \"Monday, Monday\" by the band the Mamas & the Papas. In a review for AllMusic, Mark Deming said that the single \"was a far cry from anything the Bangles had recorded before\"; while Matthew Greenwald, also from the website, said\nIt's a clever and deceptively simple pop narrative, an infectious pop confection ... There is also an excellently written bridge that shows Prince/Christopher to be an excellent craftsman, and, to their credit, the Bangles carry it off with style and wit?\nRobert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times called the song \"a candidate for best single of the year\". The Guardian music critic Dorian Lynskey commented about the painful rhyming of \"Sunday\" with \"I-don't-have-to-run day.\"\nMark Moses from The Phoenix said \"the lack of lyrical substance is so glaring that Prince's lame 'Manic Monday' seems like a thematic highlight\". Greg Baker of The Miami News wrote in the album's review that \"the song should put the Bangles on the 'pop 'n' roll' map\". A writer in Toledo Blade noted that \"Manic Monday\" was \"infectious\" and,"

The song was written by Kara DioGuardi, John Shanks and Lohan, and produced by the former two. \"Over\" was released as the second single from Speak on December 13, 2004, in the United States, by Casablanca Records. Lyrically, \"Over\" is about how her boyfriend will not commit and that their relationship feels \"on again, off again\".\nCritically, \"Over\" received positive reviews from music critics, who called the song \"catchy\" and praised Lohan's vocal performance. Commercially, \"Over\" achieved moderate success, reaching top 30 positions in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the single peaked at number one on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart for three weeks.\nJake Nava directed the accompanying music video for \"Over\", which depicts Lohan and her love interest, played by Drew Fuller, being distanced by his parents. Lohan performed \"Over\" in TV programs such as Good Morning America and The Ellen DeGeneres Show, in addition to online performances.\n\"Over\" was written by Kara DioGuardi, John Shanks and Lohan, and produced by DioGuardi and Shanks, with Shanks playing the bass, guitar, keyboards and doing the mixing, while DioGuardi provided backing vocals. Jeff Rothschild was responsible for Lohan's vocal recording, which occurred at the Henson Recording Studios in Hollywood. He also handled the song's mixing, programming and engineering. Other engineers involved were Dave Aud\u00e9 and Mark Valentine. \"Over\" is written in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C minor with Lohan's voice spanning from C\u2074 to C\u2075. According to Spence D. of IGN, \"Over\" begins like a song by the Cure, complete with a \"mournful acoustic guitar\" and a \"haunting piano-tuned synth\". He wrote that since the song was not penned by Robert Smith, \"it quickly turns into a slow rocker in which Lohan returns to her 'can't live without you' love torn subject matter\". In an 2014 interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Lohan told DeGeneres the song was about her break-up with Wilmer Valderrama.\n\"Over\" received positive reviews from critics. While responding negatively to a majority of Speak, John Murphy of MusicOMH cited \"Over\" as being \"actually rather good\" and noted similarities between the song and the works of Michelle Branch. Nicholas Fonseca from Entertainment Weekly considered the track a \"tween-slumber-party-friendly\" which \"is perfect for singing into your curling iron in front of the mirror\".\n\"Over\" achieved moderate chart success around the globe. In the United States, the single reached number one on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart for three weeks and reached number 39 on the Mainstream Top 40 component chart. In the United Kingdom, the single reached a peak of number 27 on the UK Singles Chart. In Australia, \"Over\" debuted at its peak of number 27 on the ARIA Charts, falling out of the chart seven weeks later. \"Over\" also attained the top 30 in Ireland, peaking at number 19. On the European Hot 100 Singles, \"Over\" managed to reach number 79.\nThe accompanying music video for \"Over\" was directed by Jake Nava in Los Angeles, who also directed the music video for Lohan's previous single \"Rumors\". The music video was inspired by the 1999 film American Beauty.\nIn the music video, Lohan is walking home when she sees her love interest, played by Drew Fuller, looking out of a window in his house as his mother sets the table behind him. Then his father comes up to him and they begin to argue. The curtains close and Lohan continues on to her house, next door to her boyfriend's, and runs up to her bedroom. Looking out her window, she sees that he is looking back at her. As noted inside Lohan's bedroom, she is starting to experiment with rebellious adolescence. There are Teletubbies and stuffed pandas, but also posters of bands such as L7, the Dead Kennedys and CBGB. These imagery are intercut with shots of Lohan and her band playing in a garage, a pool party and also her love interest destroying his father's car in the family garage.\nThe music video received positive reviews from critics. IGN's Spence D. commented that \"you've got a somewhat clich\u00e9d, but nonetheless hit-worthy video montage\". Justin Moran, while ranking Lohan's best music videos in Paper magazine, stated,\n\"In the video for angry rock-pop track \"Over,\" Lindsay stares at a neighbor boy from her bedroom window, wears too"

It was composed by drummer Peter Criss, his friend Stan Penridge and producer Bob Ezrin. Casablanca Records released it as a single in August 1976, after it was released as the B-side of \"Detroit Rock City\". \"Beth\" is Kiss's biggest commercial hit in the United States; it reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100, received a Gold Record certification from the RIAA, and won the 1977 People's Choice Award for \"Favorite Song\". In 2003, \"Beth\" ranked #3 in VH1's 25 Greatest Power Ballads.\nThe song, originally titled \"Beck\", was composed by Criss and Penridge during their time with the band Chelsea. During the recording of Destroyer, Criss showed it to Ezrin, who made several changes to it and recommended changing its title to \"Beth\". \"Beth\" has appeared on several compilations and live albums, including Kiss Unplugged (1996), where the group performed it acoustically.\nBy 1975, Kiss had released three studio albums, in which the compositional contributions of drummer Peter Criss were minimal; the only track on which he appeared credited was the instrumental track \"Love Theme from Kiss\", written by the four members of the band and included in their debut album. Criss assumed the role of vocalist in other songs created by his bandmates; however, for Destroyer, Criss set himself the goal of adding one of his own compositions. During a limousine ride, Criss sang a fast-paced version of \"Beck\" for bassist Gene Simmons and guitarist Paul Stanley, assuming they would not be interested in including a sentimental ballad on the album. Simmons and Stanley suggested that he sing it to producer Bob Ezrin, who agreed to record it and assured him that it would be a success.\nDuring Criss's time in Chelsea, he and the group's guitarist Stan Penridge decided to write a mocking song about the wife of their bandmate Mike Brand, Becky. According to Criss, she regularly called the group during rehearsals to ask when her husband would come home, and this gave them the idea of composing the first verse of the song: \"Beck, I hear you callin', but I can't come home right now. Me and the boys are playin', and we just can't find the sound\". Criss later admitted that he composed the song for his first wife, Lydia.\nCriss sang the song to Bob Ezrin, who decided to include it in Destroyer because Kiss' other songs were primarily about sex, and \"Beck\" was a love song that \"everyone would relate to\". Ezrin made several arrangements of the song's melody and wrote part of the lyrics. Gene Simmons suggested changing the name to \"Beth\" because it would be easier to sing and to avoid confusion with Jeff Beck. However, Lydia Criss later claimed credit for proposing the change for the same reason, and because the original Becky had a twin sister named Beth.\nIn his autobiography, Simmons recounted that \"I have never seen [Criss] compose a single song. Peter might have contributed a line or two of the lyrics, but after listening to Penridge's original demo, it's clear who made the original song\". In 2014, during an interview for Rolling Stone, Paul Stanley agreed with Simmons's assessment that Penridge was the main author, and he commented that Criss had nothing to do with the composition of \"Beth\", adding that \"if you write one hit, you should be able to write two\". Criss, in his defense, mentioned that Stanley was jealous because \"he is the main vocalist of a group in which he did not write the greatest success. That's his problem. They hate the fact that I was the songwriter of a hit and won the People's Choice\".\nFor the song's recording, Ezrin brought the New York Philharmonic orchestra and musician Dick Wagner into the A&R studio as a substitute for Ace Frehley. According to Criss and Simmons, Frehley did not participate in the recording because he was engaged in playing cards with friends. Once the orchestra arrived at the studio, Ezrin suggested that all 25 members wear fake tuxedos and that Criss appear in the studio in his trademark makeup so he could take some pictures. For his part, Ezrin put on a top hat and played the grand piano. Finally, Criss recorded the vocals at the Record Plant studio.\nStructurally, \"Beth\" lacks a solo; instead, the mid-octave section repeats the intro along with the chorus in an orchestral interlude. The sound of the violin and viola, led by the cello, change the key from C major to A minor and then the trumpets, tubas, trombones and French horns enter, accentuating the hook.\nThe song was a last-minute addition to"

The song was released as the fourth single from the album in April 2007. It was co-written and co-produced by Timberlake, along with Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley and Nate \"Danja\" Hills. The song was produced following Timberlake's two-year hiatus from the music industry; when he felt \"burnt out\" after the release of his debut solo album Justified in 2002. \"Summer Love\" is a dance-pop and pop song about \"wanting to fall in love with the lusty seasonal lover\". Its instrumentation consists of keyboards, drums, guitars, pianos and handclaps.\n\"Summer Love\" received generally positive acclaim from music critics; with some comparing it to his work with his former group 'N Sync. Despite not being officially released in the United States, \"Summer Love\" reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Pop Songs chart. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling over one million units. The song also peaked at the top 10 in Belgium and Canada. \"Summer Love\" was included in the set list of Timberlake's second world tour FutureSex/LoveShow in 2007.\nWhen composing songs for his second studio album FutureSex/LoveSounds, Timberlake went to former Justified collaborator Timbaland's studio in Virginia Beach, Virginia, to begin sessions for his second album. However, not one of them had an idea of what the album would be\u2013no plan for it and even a title. \"Summer Love/Set the Mood (Prelude)\" was written and produced by Timo \"Timbaland\" Mosley, Nate \"Danja\" Hills and Timberlake himself. The song was recorded by Jimmy Douglas, while its mixing was done by Douglas together with Timbaland. The keyboards were provided by Timberlake, Timbaland and Danja; the latter also played the drums in the single.\n\"Summer Love\" was released as the sixth and final single from FutureSex/LoveSounds. The song was remixed with additional vocals by hip-hop rapper Stat Quo. A reviewer of DJ Booth commented that the collaboration will \"burn up the dance floors\". He also explained that \"the collaboration is chalked full of infectious production work from none other than Timbo [Timbaland].\"\n\"Summer Love\" is an uptempo pop song, with a length of 4 minutes and 13 seconds. According to digital sheet music published at Musinotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, \"Summer Love\" was written in the key of D minor, in common time with a moderately slow 96 beat-per-minute tempo. Timberlake's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of D4 to the high note of A5. Its instrumentation consists of keyboards, drums, guitar, piano and handclaps.  Barry Schwartz of Stylus Magazine praised the song and commented that \"with its good foot hesitation boom-clap and cascading chorus synthline\" 'Summer Love' shows Timberlake's best vocals on FutureSex/LoveSounds.\" Schwartz further said that \"the beat drops out while he sings in perfect harmony, 'Tell me how they got that pretty little face on that pretty little frame girl'\".  Lyrically, the single is about \"wanting to fall in love with the lusty seasonal lover\".\nCritics reacted in a generally positive manner to \"Summer Love\". Barry Schwartz of Stylus Magazine gave \"Summer Love\" a positive review and additionally praised \"its good foot hesitation boom-clap and cascading chorus\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated, \"a dreary central-casting pop ballad called 'Summer Love' is enlivened only by another of Timberlake's peculiar announcements: 'I'm sick and tired of trying to save the world.' Shaheem Reid and Jayson Rodriguez off MTV News stated that \"Summer Love\" alongside Timberlake's 2007 singles \"My Love\" and \"LoveStoned\", rocked every iPod, stereo player and stadium during his tour. North by Northwestern's Dagny Salas called \"Summer Love/Set the Mood (Interlude)\" a stand-out track on FutureSex/LoveSounds. According to him the song \"oozes sun, sex, and a sultry affair\". A reviewer of IGN commented that \"the bulk of the album is focused on funk lite, but with 'Summer Love/Set The Mood (Prelude)' Timberlake and Timbaland slip into darkness.\" An editor of Billboard criticized Timbaland's production: \"[W]hile the track offers cunning instrumentation, Timbaland's heavy production hand is so overwhelming that the singer is pushed to the back of the track\".\nThe song debuted at number 74 on the US"

It was released on July 7, 2003 by Jive Records as the fourth single from the album. He co-wrote the track with its producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo of The Neptunes. According to Timberlake, the song was influenced by Stevie Wonder. Musically, \"Se\u00f1orita\" is an R&B, pop, and jazz up-tempo ballad, featuring an electric piano strut, cowbell in beat of the song, and a rhythm section. The song has been described as a Spanish \"number\" with a \"Latin flavored\" cut beat. In the track, Timberlake sings about a woman, whose attention he is trying to capture. \"Se\u00f1orita\" received positive reviews from music critics, who commented on the track's general sound and lyrics.\nCommercially, the song peaked within the top ten in Australia and New Zealand, the top twenty in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, and the top thirty in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. Its music video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the category for Best Male Video in 2004.\n\"Se\u00f1orita\" was co-written by Justin Timberlake, and The Neptunes' Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo. Before the release of Timberlake's solo album, Justified, Timberlake and the album's producers, Williams and Hugo, gave MTV News a preview of the record in August 2002. While in discussion of \"Se\u00f1orita\", Hugo said that he expected the song to make the track listing of Justified. In another interview, Timberlake revealed that the song was influenced by singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder. Timberlake said that the song had \"that groove that really fits into the summer\". While in development, Timberlake said he was \"beatboxing the notes\". He wrote the song imagining a \"dark-skinned, voluptuous lady whose attention he is trying to capture.\"\n\"Se\u00f1orita\" is a \"Spanish number\" infused with an R&B, up-tempo ballad. The song has been described as a fast \"hot mid-tempo\" and dance song. The song is composed in the key of E\u266d minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 96 beats per minute. The music begins with an electric piano strut, that provides the main chordal accompaniment. A cowbell chimes, in beat of the song, in the background. Timberlake sings in a \"reasonable falsetto vamping\".

It was written by Halliwell, Andy Watkins and Paul Wilson, whilst produced by the latter two, who are known collectively as Absolute. \"Mi Chico Latino\" was released as the album's second single on 16 August 1999 by EMI Records. It is a Latin pop song which is centred on a lost love theme. The song was written by Halliwell in order to pay homage to her mother, who has Spanish background, whilst it also has a number of Spanish lyrics.\n\"Mi Chico Latino\" received mixed reviews from music critics, who noted it was a contribution to the Latin pop phenom at the time, while others criticized Halliwell's Spanish pronunciation. The song was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, debuting at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Halliwell's first number-one solo single in the country. The song also attracted some moderate success worldwide. \"Mi Chico Latino\"'s accompanying music video was directed by Doug Nichol and filmed on the island of Sardinia. It depicts the singer wearing a black bikini and dancing with semi-nude male dancers on a boat. In order to promote the single, Halliwell performed the song on Top of the Pops and Party in the Park in 1999.\n\"Mi Chico Latino\" was written by Halliwell, Andy Watkins and Paul Wilson in the autumn of 1998. The singer wanted to make a song with Spanish influences, in order to pay homage for her Spanish mother. During a day in the studio, they came up with a melody but did not have any words. Then she called her mother for help. Halliwell recalled asking her, \"Mum, what do you say to a bloke in Spanish if you fancy him and are being romantic?\" Her mother then said she did not remember that. So she asked her look at her library of Spanish language romances, and she read the titles out to Halliwell. Eventually she came out with \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el hombre con fuego en la sangre?\" (\"Where is the man with fire in his blood?\" in English), and she liked the way it sounded, and included the line at the beginning of the song. After \"Look at Me\" peaked only at number two, her record company wanted her to release \"Lift Me Up\", while the Absolute team wanted \"Bag It Up\", but she chose to release \"Mi Chico Latino\" after receiving good reception from children. She also thought,\n\"First and foremost I thought it was a good record. It was poppy and catchy and perfect for the summer. I think my core audience is young teenage girls and gay guys. Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The other thing that 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So it was a strange example of synchronicity that I should be ready to go with a Latin track which I had written almost a year before\".\n\"Mi Chico Latino\" is a Latin pop song which moves at a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute. At the beginning of the song, Halliwell chants the spoken word line \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el hombre con fuego en la sangre?\" (which translates to Where is the man with fire in the blood?). The lyrics to the song are centred on a lost love theme, with castanets in the background. During the song, the singer also sings in Italian on its chorus, when everything else is Spanish. According to biographer David Sinclair in his book Spice Girls Revisited: How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop, Halliwell continued to explore the Riviera-pop theme of her former group's song, \"Viva Forever\", whilst \"murmuring sweet nothings in a peculiar brand of estuary Spanish while castanets and timbales clattered alongside a cod-flamenco guitar\".\nIn 1999 Ishtar, the Israeli lead singer of Alabina, said \"Mi Chico Latino\" was plagiarized from her song \"Alabina (De La Noche A La Manana)\", released the year before. A spokesman for Alabina's French record label Atal said that they were \"anxiously contacting\" Halliwell's record label about the songs' similarities. However, no legal actions were made.\n\"Mi Chico Latino\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Jon Perks, whilst reviewing Schizophonic for Sunday Mercury, gave a positive review, stating, \"Okay, so it sounds like a hybrid of La Vida Loca and Madonna's La Isla Bonita,"

It was written and produced by Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley, and Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon, with additional writing from James Fauntleroy. It was released as the third single from the album on February 24, 2014. The song is a mid-tempo pop ballad, that makes use of an acoustic guitar throughout, with its lyrics centering on the semantic field of love.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" received positive reviews from several contemporary music critics. The song's music video premiered on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on March 20, 2014. It is a mini documentary, that follows two documentary filmmakers searching for a couple that got engaged on January 12, 2014, while heading to New York City on the Long Island Rail Road train, with the man proposing to his girlfriend to \"Not a Bad Thing\". The video concludes with the filmmakers being led to several false leads, with a second part of the video to follow. Timberlake performed the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and during The 20/20 Experience World Tour. The song reached number 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Mainstream Top 40.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" was written by Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley, Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon, and James Fauntleroy. The song was produced by Timbaland, Timberlake, and Harmon. Timberlake arranged and produced his vocals, which were recorded at Larabee Studios in North Hollywood, California. Harmon provided keyboards for the song, while Elliot Ives and Timberlake played the guitar. The track was engineered by Chris Godbey, and mixed by Jimmy Douglass, Godbey and Timberlake, with assistance from Alejandro Baima, at Larabee Studios.\nRCA executives reportedly believed that \"Not a Bad Thing\" could be The 20/20 Experience \u2013 2 of 2's largest commercial success. However, they instead opted to release \"Take Back the Night\" and \"TKO\" first, to represent the album's R&B sound and distinguish \"Not a Bad Thing\" from the sonically similar \"Mirrors\". A radio edit of the song was digitally released on February 24, 2014 in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The next day, it impacted the contemporary hit radio in the United States. On March 31 was sent to US adult contemporary radio and on May 27 to its UK equivalent. \"Not a Bad Thing\" was released as a CD single in Austria, Germany and Switzerland; apart of the radio edit of the song it also featured the \"TKO (Black Friday Remix)\". \"Not a Bad Thing\" impacted the mainstream radio in Italy on June 4.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" is a mid-tempo pop ballad, with a running duration of 11 minutes and 28 seconds; the album version has an included hidden track entitled \"Pair of Wings\". Critics noted the song's resemblance to songs by former boy band NSYNC, which Timberlake had previously been a member of. and the song's focus on the theme of love. PopMatters' Brice Ezell saw \"Not a Bad Thing\" to share the same characteristics as NSYNC's 1999 \"(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You\", using the same \"emotional earnestness\" which made the latter song the \"heart-melter\" it was during its release. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times described the song as a \"dewy, blue-eyed soul number\" that was realized when Timberlake was discovering the \"emotional possibilities of his singing\" during his time with the boy band. Holly Gleason of Paste interpreted the lyrics as endorsing love, with the song contrasting the previous tracks on The 20/20 Experience\u00a0\u2013 2 of 2, celebrating the \"happily ever after trope for all its worth\".\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" received general acclaim from critics. Jeremy Thomas of 411mania.com selected \"Not a Bad Thing\" as one of the stand-out tracks from The 20/20 Experience\u00a0\u2013 2 of 2, using it as an example of a song from the album that \"has a gentle side that can be appreciated,\" noting it as a \"lovely close\" to the album. Similarly selecting the track as a stand-out, Chris Bosman of Consequence of Sound saw the song serving as the \"pitch perfect\" nostalgic track, pointing out its 'NSYNC influence. As well as depicting the latter influence, Melinda Newman of HitFix awarded the track an A grade, labeling it as a \"lovely, lilting straight-up pop tune.\" David Meller of musicOMH described the track as"

Can I leave with you?\" and the women to sing, \"I don't know what I'm thinking bout / really leavin wit you.\"\nMusic critic David Browne of Entertainment Weekly, in review of the album, wrote: \"In the latter category, he's more engaging\u2014the stud on the loose, making promises of romance and more in slurpy cuts like 'Senorita' and 'Rock Your Body'.\" Denise Boyd of the BBC wrote: \"The introduction [of] 'Senorita' immediately grabs your attention.\" Tyler Martin of Stylus said that the song's rhythm section was \"brilliant, a simple, yet distinctive beat that could only come from the Neptunes. The song allows for much amusement in the last minute and a half with a sing-along that is more wonderful and surprising than most artists have offered us this year.\" Jonathan Takiff of the Philadelphia Daily"

It was the second single released from his 1984 album Born in the U.S.A.. Springsteen wrote the song for Donna Summer. However, his manager, Jon Landau, decided the song had hit potential, and so he kept it for the upcoming Springsteen album. It has been certified Gold in the US.\nThe song was recorded on January 25, 1982 at The Hit Factory, during the first wave of the Born in the U.S.A. sessions. At the time, the song was originally suggested for Donna Summer, but rejected by Jon Landau in favor of \"Protection\" (another song written by Springsteen). An unreleased \"outtake\" of the song, titled \"Drop On Down and Cover Me\", has long been considered a precursor to the officially released \"Cover Me\", but was actually recorded in June 1983.\nThe song peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts in October 1984. It was the second of a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles to be released from Born in the U.S.A.\nNo music video was made for the song.\n\n\n\n\nContinuing the club play goal started with \"Dancing in the Dark\", Arthur Baker created the 12-inch \"Undercover Mix\" of \"Cover Me\". This was a large-scale transformation: a new bass line was cut, an unused backing vocal by industry legend Jocelyn Brown was restored, and reggae and dub elements were introduced. It was released on October 15, 1984.\nAs with the previous effort, the result displeased some of Springsteen's more strait-laced fans, but did gain actual club play: the remix went to number 11 on Billboard's Hot Dance/Disco chart.\n\nCover Me \u2013 3:26\nJersey Girl \u2013 6:15 with an edited spoken introduction, or at 6:10 without a spoken introduction.\nThe B-side of the single, \"Jersey Girl\", was a live performance of a Tom Waits song, recorded on July 9, 1981 at Meadowlands Arena.  Springsteen had introduced the song earlier in that special River Tour homecoming stand that opened the arena, slightly rewriting it to replace a Waits line about \"whores on Eighth Avenue\" and adding a verse that included \"that little brat of yours and drop[ping] her off at your mom's.\" \"Jersey Girl\" would become a Springsteen fan favorite, although played rarely as time went on. This same recording would later be released as the closing track of Live 1975-85.\nDiffering pressings of the single had different lengths of \"Jersey Girl\", sometimes dropping most of a spoken introduction of 0:31 seconds in length. The UK 12-inch single contains the full-length version with the complete spoken introduction at 6:36. Both the sleeve and label erroneously state a playing time of 5:50.\n\"Cover Me\" (Undercover Mix) \u2013 6:09\n\"Cover Me\" (Dub 1) \u2013 4:02\n\"Cover Me\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 3:46\n\"Cover Me\" (Dub 2) \u2013 4:15\n\"Cover Me\" \u2013 3:26\n\"Pink Cadillac\" \u2013 3:33\nSpringsteen was unsure of how to play \"Cover Me\" in concert, and initially it appeared irregularly in the 1984\u20131985 Born in the U.S.A. Tour.  Then, inspired by Arthur Baker's remix, he rearranged it to open and close with a quiet, ominous, extended, echoing segment as new E Street backup singer Patti Scialfa wailed a snippet of Martha & the Vandellas' \"Nowhere to Run\" (in her one spotlight role of the show) while her future husband reverbed \"Cuh ... vuh ... me-ee-ee\", after which the song ramped up into showcase guitar work for Springsteen and Nils Lofgren.  \"Cover Me\" thus became a featured song on the tour, often opening the second set; such a performance was included on the 1986 Live/1975-85.\n\"Cover Me\" continued as a regular selection on the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express and Human Rights Now! Tours, and the 1992 leg of the \"Other Band\" Tour (now without Scialfa's part).  After December 1992 it was dropped until Springsteen's first concert in Oslo on July 7, 2008 and most recently in Philadelphia on October 20, 2009.  The song has been performed 300 times through 2008. The song has turned up as a semi-regular on the Working On A Dream Tour, especially after Springsteen and the E Street Band began playing the entire Born in the U.S.A. album in New York and Philadelphia.\nBorn in the U.S.A.

It is the second track on their tenth studio album, All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), and was released as the album's second single on 29 January 2001. The band's lead vocalist Bono has said the song was inspired by a fictional conversation with his friend Michael Hutchence about suicide. The song peaked at number 52 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, their native Ireland and Italy, while reaching the top 10 in Australia, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Spain and the United Kingdom. In 2002, the song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" originated from a gospel-influenced chord progression that guitarist the Edge composed on a piano in a Japanese hotel room. He said: \"I suppose I was consciously looking for something in that [gospel] tradition. Having been through that whole experimentation period during Pop\u2014with techno and dance ideas and dance aesthetics\u2014it seemed like I wanted to get back to something a bit more earthy.\" During the recording sessions for All That You Can't Leave Behind, the Edge played the piano piece in a music sequencer, after which co-producer Brian Eno removed every first and second note, leaving every third note. Eno then set it into a different keyboard with extensive treatments, resulting in what the Edge called an \"otherworldly effect\" on top of his \"traditional gospel piano sequence\". Co-producer Daniel Lanois said the recorded version of the song was essentially a live take performed by the band with him and Eno. On guitar, Lanois played \"the harmony to The Edge's part\". The Edge achieved a clean guitar tone by plugging his 1950s Fender Stratocaster guitar directly into a Fender Bassman amplifier. The song ends with a \"choral chant\" written by the Edge; Lanois said they had always wanted to compose such a part before. The group tried several variations of it before settling on the version that appears on record. The vocals were sung by the Edge, Lanois, and Eno; Lanois said it was easy to imagine hiring a choir to sing the part but \"if you want it to sound like a U2 record, then you use the team\". Mick Jagger and his daughter Elizabeth recorded backing vocals for the song, although these did not make the final mix.\nU2's lead singer Bono wrote the lyrics about the suicide of his close friend Michael Hutchence, lead singer of the band INXS. The song is written in the form of an argument about suicide in which Bono tries to convince Hutchence of the act's foolishness. Bono characterised the song as a fight between friends, which he felt guilty for never having with Hutchence. As Bono said in 2005, \"It's a row between mates. You're kinda trying to wake them up out of an idea. In my case it's a row I didn't have while he was alive. I feel the biggest respect I could pay to him was not to write some stupid soppy song, so I wrote a really tough, nasty little number, slapping him around the head. And I'm sorry, but that's how it came out of me.\"\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" was released in the UK on 29 January 2001, in Australia on 12 February 2001, in the United States on 6 August 2001, and in Canada on 30 October 2001.\nThe song was performed at every show on the Elevation Tour in 2001. The song was not played again until the third leg on the Vertigo Tour in 2005 in an acoustic form by Bono and The Edge. The full band electric version was revived for the sixth leg of the Vertigo Tour in 2006. The song was performed on the U2 360\u00b0 Tour, again in an acoustic form by Bono and The Edge. The song was played five times on the Innocence + Experience Tour. These performances were by the full band and featured The Edge on the piano. The song was not performed on the Experience + Innocence Tour in 2018, but was played during many promotional shows for the Songs of Experience album. It made two appearances on The Joshua Tree Tour 2019. Both performances were in Sydney and were dedicated to Michael Hutchence.\nThree official music videos were filmed for the song. The first video (known as the US version) is directed by Joseph Kahn, features an American football game between the \"Flys\" [sic] and the \"Lemons\" filmed at the Houston Astrodome, and"

It is the fifth track on their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), and was released as the album's fourth single on 6 June 2005. It was produced by Flood, with additional production by Chris Thomas and Jacknife Lee. The song reached number one in Spain, and peaked in the top ten in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and several other countries. The music video was shot at the General Motors Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\nThe earliest incarnation of the song was developed during sessions for the band's 1997 album, Pop. The lyrics were written by the band's lead vocalist Bono, taking partial inspiration from his recollection of his first trip to London, and from the band's experience playing in New York City in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks during their Elevation Tour in 2001. Other lyrics refer to Bono's relationship with his wife Ali. The song's underlying theme reflects lost innocence and was inspired by an image Bono saw of himself from the early 1980s. The sound has been compared to the tone of U2's 1984 album, The Unforgettable Fire and their 1987 single \"Where the Streets Have No Name\".\n\"City of Blinding Lights\" was well received by critics and won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song at the 2006 ceremony. The song made its live debut on the group's 2005\u20132006 Vertigo Tour, when it was commonly played as the opening song. It has been performed at nearly every show from a U2 concert tour since. The track has been used in episodes of The Simpsons and Entourage, and in the film The Devil Wears Prada. Former U.S. President Barack Obama used the song at his campaign events during the 2008 and 2012 U.S. presidential elections, and listed it as one of his favourite songs; U2 performed it at his 2009 inaugural celebration at the Lincoln Memorial.\nU2 developed \"City of Blinding Lights\" from a song called \"Scott Walker\", an outtake from the band's 1997 album Pop. This incarnation, written as an homage to the singer of the same name, was only an outline when the recording sessions for Pop concluded. The group reworked it in preparation for their 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind, but the song was still unfinished when that album was released. They rewrote the song for their 2004 album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Bassist Adam Clayton said, \"There was a melody and a groove that ultimately didn't go anywhere and we kind of threw out everything, found chords that worked with that melody and built it back up, new drum parts, new bass parts, new guitars.\"\nA photographic exhibition in the Netherlands by longtime band photographer Anton Corbijn served as a thematic inspiration for the song. Lead vocalist Bono saw an image of himself boarding a helicopter, taken in 1982 during filming of the music video for \"New Year's Day.\" A journalist asked him what he would say to his younger self if given the chance; Bono replied, \"I'd tell him he's absolutely right and stop second guessing himself.\" He explained his comments later, saying, \"I realized how much I'd lost\u00a0... that way of looking at the world. There was such a clarity to it, but it was so defiant in a way.\"\nThe chorus was inspired by U2's first concert in New York City following the September 11 attacks during their 2001 Elevation Tour. When the lights illuminated the audience during a performance of \"Where the Streets Have No Name,\" the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans. Upon seeing this raw release of emotion, Bono shouted, \"Oh you look so beautiful tonight\"; later, the band integrated the line into the chorus. The fans' passion, along with the resolve of the city following the attack, were the primary inspirations for many of the song's other lyrics.\n\"City of Blinding Lights\" is played in common time at a tempo of 139 beats per minute in two keys: A\u266d major in the verses, and E\u266d major in the chorus.\nThe album version of the song runs for 5:47. It begins with a low note played on an electric guitar with heavy delay and"

It is the fourth track on their tenth studio album, All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000). The song was first released in Canada on 20 February 2001, then was given a UK release in November of the same year; it was the album's second single in Canada and the fourth internationally. The song was written about Burmese academic Aung San Suu Kyi, who was the chairperson of the National League for Democracy and was placed under house arrest from 1989 until 2010 for her pro-democracy activities, which led to the song being banned in Burma. In 2002, the song won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, marking the first time an artist had won the award for songs from the same album in consecutive years.\nIn the United States, the song peaked at number 21 on the Adult Top 40, number 19 on the Mainstream Rock chart, and number 10 on the Alternative Songs chart. It also topped the charts in Canada and Portugal, and reached the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nIn March 2000, U2 were awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin at a ceremony where Burmese academic Aung San Suu Kyi was honoured but absent. The band had never heard of Suu Kyi prior to that but learned that her activism and fighting for freedom in Burma led to her being under house arrest since 1989 (a sentence that was later ended in 2010). Her story inspired U2 lead vocalist Bono for the lyrics to \"Walk On\".\nAt first, Bono tried writing from the perspective of Suu Kyi's husband and son, imagining them living with the pain of not knowing how she was. Feeling that it seemed presumptuous, Bono changed the lyrics to be more abstract and to be \"a love song about somebody having to leave a relationship for all the right reasons\". He said the song was about \"nobility and personal sacrifice, about doing what's right, even if your heart is telling you otherwise.\" In explaining the lyrics, he recalled a Biblical passage in Corinthians that used the image of a house fire to impart the lesson that only eternal things can survive. To Bono, these things were family and friendships, rather than anything that someone could concretely make. Accordingly, \"Walk On\" concludes with lyrics describing a \"litany of ambitions and achievements\" that are expendable, with lines such as \"You've got to leave it behind / All that you fashion / All that you make / All that you build / All that you break\". Bono described this section as: \"a mantra, really, a bonfire of vanities, and you can throw anything you want on the fire. Whatever you want more than love, it has to go.\" The album's title was derived from the song's lyrics \"The only baggage you can bring is all that you can't leave behind.\" Suu Kyi would later declare to Bono that she liked the song, saying \"it's very close to how I feel\".\nAs U2 worked on \"Walk On\" during the recording sessions, they decided to split it into two separate songs: \"Walk On\" and \"Home\". The album's producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois advised the group that the mix of \"Walk On\" \"was not one to chase\", but Bono insisted they continue working on it. Towards the end of the album's recording sessions, the band's long-time producer Steve Lillywhite was hired to make some final touches to the songs. After he completed \"Beautiful Day\", the band played him \"Walk On\" and \"Home\". Lillywhite told them that \"Walk On\" had a \"fantastic chorus\" and \"Home\" a \"great verse\"; the band subsequently informed him that they used to be the same song. Ultimately, under Lillywhite's guidance, the separate songs were fused back together. Bassist Adam Clayton concurred with the decision, saying that each had great chord progressions but were not great individual songs. Lanois preferred a different version of the song with a more low-key beginning, saying: \"When it gets to that stage of making a record, people are looking for songs that the record company can proudly go to radio with. And the ultimate version comes along with a bang, you know. The Edge sounds amazing and it holds so much promise in its first 30 seconds that it's hard to say no to. But the version that I preferred did not have such a slam-bam beginning. So that one got welded and bolted together.\"\nMost of the guitar tone on \"Walk On\" was achieved by guitarist the Edge playing his white Gibson Les Paul"

It is the second track on their tenth studio album, All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), and was released as the album's second single on 29 January 2001. The band's lead vocalist Bono has said the song was inspired by a fictional conversation with his friend Michael Hutchence about suicide. The song peaked at number 52 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, their native Ireland and Italy, while reaching the top 10 in Australia, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Spain and the United Kingdom. In 2002, the song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" originated from a gospel-influenced chord progression that guitarist the Edge composed on a piano in a Japanese hotel room. He said: \"I suppose I was consciously looking for something in that [gospel] tradition. Having been through that whole experimentation period during Pop\u2014with techno and dance ideas and dance aesthetics\u2014it seemed like I wanted to get back to something a bit more earthy.\" During the recording sessions for All That You Can't Leave Behind, the Edge played the piano piece in a music sequencer, after which co-producer Brian Eno removed every first and second note, leaving every third note. Eno then set it into a different keyboard with extensive treatments, resulting in what the Edge called an \"otherworldly effect\" on top of his \"traditional gospel piano sequence\". Co-producer Daniel Lanois said the recorded version of the song was essentially a live take performed by the band with him and Eno. On guitar, Lanois played \"the harmony to The Edge's part\". The Edge achieved a clean guitar tone by plugging his 1950s Fender Stratocaster guitar directly into a Fender Bassman amplifier. The song ends with a \"choral chant\" written by the Edge; Lanois said they had always wanted to compose such a part before. The group tried several variations of it before settling on the version that appears on record. The vocals were sung by the Edge, Lanois, and Eno; Lanois said it was easy to imagine hiring a choir to sing the part but \"if you want it to sound like a U2 record, then you use the team\". Mick Jagger and his daughter Elizabeth recorded backing vocals for the song, although these did not make the final mix.\nU2's lead singer Bono wrote the lyrics about the suicide of his close friend Michael Hutchence, lead singer of the band INXS. The song is written in the form of an argument about suicide in which Bono tries to convince Hutchence of the act's foolishness. Bono characterised the song as a fight between friends, which he felt guilty for never having with Hutchence. As Bono said in 2005, \"It's a row between mates. You're kinda trying to wake them up out of an idea. In my case it's a row I didn't have while he was alive. I feel the biggest respect I could pay to him was not to write some stupid soppy song, so I wrote a really tough, nasty little number, slapping him around the head. And I'm sorry, but that's how it came out of me.\"\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" was released in the UK on 29 January 2001, in Australia on 12 February 2001, in the United States on 6 August 2001, and in Canada on 30 October 2001.\nThe song was performed at every show on the Elevation Tour in 2001.

It is the first track on their tenth studio album, All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), and was released as the album's lead single on 9 October 2000. The song was a commercial success, helping launch the album to multi-platinum status, and is one of U2's biggest hits to date.\nLike many tracks from All That You Can't Leave Behind, \"Beautiful Day\" harkens back to the group's past sound. The tone of the Edge's guitar was a subject of debate amongst the band members, as they disagreed on whether he should use a sound similar to that from their early career in the 1980s. The band's lead vocalist Bono explained that the upbeat track is about losing everything but still finding joy in what one has.\nThe song received positive reviews, and it became the band's 14th number-one single in their native Ireland, fourth number-one in the United Kingdom, and their first number-one in the Netherlands. It also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Finland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Scotland and Spain and reached the top 10 in Austria, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. The song peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, the band's highest position since \"Discoth\u00e8que\" in 1997.\nIn 2001, the song won three Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. The group has played \"Beautiful Day\" at every one of their concerts since the song's live debut on the Elevation Tour in 2001.\n\"Beautiful Day\" originated from recording sessions held by U2 in a small room at Hanover Quay Studio in Dublin in the winter of 1999. In its earliest permutation, \"Beautiful Day\" was a different song called \"Always\", which was later released as a B-side. The song's genesis came from a chord sequence that lead vocalist Bono composed and that guitarist the Edge subsequently adapted. The group worked on the song for several days in the studio, but were unable to make much progress with it. The Edge said, \"As a straight rock song, it was pretty ho-hum.\" Co-producer Daniel Lanois said: \"the sound of it was a bit stuck in the barroom, and as usual our expectations were high. We wanted to feel the future and not just the past.\"\nCo-producer Brian Eno was frustrated with the lack of progress on the song, and early one morning, he and Lanois arrived in the studio before U2 to prepare some musical ideas. Eno created a rhythm on a drum machine, over which he added a piano part and synthesised strings. Lanois played a guitar part on a Fender Telecaster that was a third above the root of the Edge's guitar sequence, providing what he described as a \"choral quality, like harmony singing\". The producers' ideas proved to be musically inspiring to the band when they arrived and resumed work on the song. Lanois described the Edge's resulting guitar playing as \"sounding like shattered, splintered metal coming at you like a meteor storm\". Near the end of a 20-minute jam of the song, Bono sang, \"It's a beautiful day, don't let it get away\". After taking a lunch break, the producers thought that Bono's improptu vocal from the outro could be made into the song's chorus. They quickly edited the vocal part into earlier sections of the jam, turning it into what would be the chorus of \"Beautiful Day\".\nBefore leaving the studio one day, the Edge listened to the chorus vocals, and thinking they sounded bare, he picked up a microphone and improvised a backing vocal, singing a high fifth. At the same time, Lanois harmonised a lower doo-wop style vocal that he described as similar to those in \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\". Their voices were then doubled and processed by Eno. The Edge called the backing vocals a \"beautiful counterpoint\" to Bono's singing and \"the final key element that the song needed\".\nDuring the recording process for the All That You Can't Leave Behind album, the band decided to distance themselves from their 1990s experimentation with electronic dance music in favour of a \"return to the traditional U2 sound\". At the same time, the band was looking for a more forward looking sound. This led to debate amongst the band when the Edge was playing the song on his Gibson Explorer guitar with a tone used in much of their early material up to their 1983 album War. Bono was particularly resistant to the guitar"

The song was released on 18 January 2013 as the lead single from her fourth studio album Girl Who Got Away (2013). The song was written and produced by Dido Armstrong and Rick Nowels, while Rollo Armstrong co-produced it. \"No Freedom\" is an acoustic ballad, with folk pop influences.\nLyrically, the song reflects on the necessity of allowing people to have freedom within the confines of a relationship. \"No Freedom\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the smooth, simple, but gorgeous sound. The song has peaked to number 51 on the UK Singles Chart, the song has also charted in Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland.\n\"No Freedom\" was written and produced by Dido and Rick Nowels, who has previously worked with her on the hit 'White Flag', while Rollo Armstrong co-produced it. The song was written when Dido was pregnant at the time with her first son, Stanley, and recorded her vocals right up until the day he was born. She recorded the song in Los Angeles, United States at Rick Nowels studio and finished the song at home with her brother Rollo Armstrong.\nPrior to the release of the single, snippets from the DJ COBRA Remix were leaked into the Internet. The melody is substantially different from the original. Later on, Dido explained on her official Twitter account that DJ Cobra - Peter Agyagos - was mistakenly sent an old demo to remix instead the final cut of the song.\nLyrically, \"No Freedom\" talks about a painful story of heartbreak. According to Dido, it is more about love in general, in all its forms. The refrain, \"No freedom without love\", has been adopted by rebel groups in Syria. Dido told BBC News that after its release, she was getting many \"letters from people who are in the middle of a war.\" The song is a folky, acoustic guitar-based, reggae tinged, midtempo song, featuring Dido's sleepy vocals.\nCritical reception was largely positive. Bernard Perusse of Montreal Gazette called it \"simple, but gorgeous.\" Elliot Robinson of So So Gay wrote that the song represents the album as a whole, calling it \"pleasingly catchy and enjoyably smooth.\" Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian was more negative, writing that \"Guitars strum gently, the tempo is mid, and Dido has never sounded more listless as she wanly informs her man that their relationship can't flourish unless she's free to wander.\" \nChuck Campbell of Knoxville.com praised \"Dido\u2019s knack for gorgeous melody,\" writing that the song is a \"simple, acoustic-driven opening track, that rolls out under her deliberate restraint as she sings.\" Nick Levine of BBC Music called it \"an odd soporific song.\" Tim Ferrar of Recording Connection called it \"one of the most subdued tracks on the record.\"\nOn 3 March 2013 the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 69 and climbed 18 places to number 51 the following week. On 10 March 2013 the song entered the Swiss Singles Chart at number 47, climbing to number 28 in its second week. On 16 March 2013 the song entered the French Singles Chart at number 64. The song entered the German Singles Chart at number 64, climbing to number 59 the following week. On 9 March 2013 the song entered the Dutch Singles Chart at number 98, dropping to number 100 the following week. The song has also charted in Belgium.\n\nA music video to accompany the release of \"No Freedom\" was first released onto YouTube on 4 March 2013 at a total length of three minutes and fifteen seconds. The music video was directed by Ethan Lader and filmed in downtown Los Angeles on 9 December 2012. She is wearing a turquoise leather coat.\nThe video shows Dido standing on an empty city street surrounded by confetti. The video also features montage of old-fashioned footage from the United States and Dido sitting in the back of a vintage Chevrolet Bel Air convertible.\nIn February 2013 she performed the song live on American late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where she also performed \"White Flag\". On 1 March 2013 she performed the song live on Norwegian-Swedish television talk show Skavlan. On 7 March 2013 she performed the song live on British daytime television programme This Morning.\nOn 3 October 2017 Miley Cyrus and Adam Sandler performed the song live on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon as a tribute for the 2017 Las Vegas shooting victims.\n\nWritten by Dido Armstrong and Rick Nowels\nProduced by Rollo, Dido and Rick Nowels\nMixed by"

It was released on 22 January 2016 by XL Recordings as the second single from her third studio album, 25 (2015). Adele co-wrote the song with Tobias Jesso Jr., while production of the track was provided by Ariel Rechtshaid. \"When We Were Young\" is a soul ballad, with lyrics that talk about reminiscing memories with a loved one.  The song received universal acclaim, with critics praising its lyrics, understated production and Adele's vocal performance.\nFollowing the release of 25, \"When We Were Young\" had already sold 150,000 digital copies in the United States as an album track. The song reached top 10 in Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The song never received an official music video, although a version of the song filmed at The Church Studios was released via Vevo. Adele promoted the song with live performances on Adele at the BBC, Saturday Night Live, Adele Live in New York City and The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\nWhile in the middle of the writing process of 25, Adele struggled with writer's block and to feel confident about the material she had, her manager was also unsure about it and asked Rick Rubin, who produced many songs on her sophomore studio album 21, to give his input on it. Rubin claimed he didn't believe in the songs she had and she admitted that she felt the material was a little rushed. Therefore, in early 2015, Adele flew to Los Angeles to work with different songwriters and producers for two months, and later she expressed interest in working with Canadian musician Tobias Jesso Jr., after discovering him after hearing his song \"Hollywood\". She later tweeted a link to Jesso's video for his single, \"How Could You Babe\". After their managers talked about the collaboration, they met and spent almost three days talking and writing. They ended up writing two songs, \"When We Were Young\" and \"Lay Me Down\", with the first being written in a Los Angeles house, in Brentwood, at Philip Glass' piano that Tobias had inherited. They started the song from scratch, as Jesso \"would play chords while Adele improvised melodies and lyrics.\" As Jesso recounted, \"There was no studio, just a piano and us, and we wrote a lot. I mean a lot lot.\"\nLater, American record producer Ariel Rechtshaid, who previously worked with Jesso, heard rumours that Adele and Jesso wanted to work with him, and he flew over to London, where he produced two songs for her. Rechtshaid claimed that Adele told him that she loved the track, but that she had a lot of ballads on the record and asked him to do whatever he wanted with that information. He later went back to Los Angeles, where he started \"chipping away at a rhythm track for it,\" as he recalled: \"It was difficult\u2014with a piano ballad, it's hard to put together a rhythm track that isn't over-the-top dramatic, kind of epic.\" Rechtshaid added that \"the song has an old soul vibe to it, but I wanted to keep it a little bit more modern. The song kind of feels like a lot of different vignettes, reflecting on different times in your life and different people, so all these instruments\u2014bass, drums, piano\u2014felt like other characters.\" According to the producer, Adele felt emotionally connected to the song and \"there was definitely a little bit of tearing up.\" He also told The Fader that it only took two takes to record the song, and during the song's middle eight, he pushed her beyond her means, since he \"felt that it needed to have a little bit more cry to it.\"\nOn 16 November 2015, a preview of \"When We Were Young\" was exhibited by Australian TV program 60 Minutes. A day later, a video of the song's performance at London's Church Studios was uploaded on her YouTube channel. On 26 November 2015, Billboard wrote an article wondering what would be 25's next single, indicating either \"When We Were Young\" or \"Send My Love (To Your New Lover)\". On 12 December 2015, Billboard confirmed \"When We Were Young\" as the album's second single, through a Columbia Records source. It was released early in Italian radio stations on 22 January 2016, and officially released worldwide on 5 February 2016. Along with the digital and streaming release, the single's cover art was revealed, featuring \"a throwback picture of her younger self.\" Carl Williott of Idolator and Lindsay Sullivan of Billboard called it \"adorable,\" while Lewis Corner of"

It features Olivia and was written by 50 Cent.\n\"Candy Shop\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming 50 Cent's third number one single and fifth top-ten single. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some calling it a retread of 50 Cent's collaboration with Lil' Kim on \"Magic Stick\" (2003). At the 2006 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Best Rap Song, and at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the music video was nominated for Best Male Video.\nIn an interview with XXL magazine, rapper Fat Joe claimed that he helped produce the track while working with producer Scott Storch. He stated: \"I'm pretty sure the world don't know we actually produced Candy Shop together. I produced it with him (Storch) ... Scott called me like 50 times, 100 times: 'Yo, you sure you don't want to use it? 50 Cent called me. 50 Cent want it.' I never had a problem with this dude. I was like, 'Go ahead.'\" When writing the song, 50 Cent stated: \"I attempted to be as sexual as possible, from a male perspective, without being vulgar or obscene.\"\n\"Candy Shop\" is a mid-tempo dancefloor track. The song was produced by Scott Storch, who took influence from Middle Eastern music. The track samples The Salsoul Orchestra's \"Love Break\". The production was described by IGN as having a \"Middle Eastern tinge\" with synthesized strings that \"unleash a darkly atonal whirl that sounds too much like something either Timbaland or The Neptunes or Mannie Fresh have concocted\". The Guardian wrote that the production contains \"wan-sounding imitations of the Neptunes' sparse, breathy funk\". PopMatters described the bridge as being \"relaxed yet faintly ominous\" with 50 Cent and Olivia crooning: \"Girl what we do (what we do) / And where we do (and where we do) / The things we do (things we do) / Are just between me and you (oh yeah).\" Rolling Stone noted the chorus for 50 Cent's \"amateur-sounding tenor croon\".\nThe song received mixed reviews from critics. PopMatters described it as \"dripping with sexual energy and cool\" and is \"sexy as hell, but contains a pretty unmistakable edge of hostility, macho swagger, and thunderous chest thumping.\" Entertainment Weekly wrote that it was an \"appealing throwaway single\" and lyrics such as \"after you work up a sweat, you can play with the stick\" are not seductions; \"they're orders\". MusicOMH wrote that the chemistry between 50 Cent and Olivia \"is almost as explicit as the lyrics ... the bass line is made for grinding to\". Author Ethan Brown, in a review of The Massacre, called the track \"uninspiring\" and \"nearly identical\" to his previous collaboration with Lil' Kim on \"Magic Stick\". He stated that 50 Cent seemed too content with his \"hypersexual image\" among other things and \"not inspired enough to work beyond the same old attention-getting schemes.\" Pitchfork Media listed \"Candy Shop\" as a reprise of \"Magic Stick\" both \"in beats and in timbre\", and Stylus magazine said it was \"more of the same\" as his previous collaboration. Billboard wrote that 50 Cent \"shows little growth lyrically\" with the song being \"typical playa-friendly fodder\". The song was nominated at the 2006 Grammy Awards for Best Rap Song, but lost to Kanye West's \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\".\n\"Candy Shop\" performed well in the United States, becoming 50 Cent's third number one single, fifth solo top-ten single, and seventh overall top-ten single. The song was a fast climber on the Hot 100 debuting at #53 on the Billboard Hot 100. In its second week on the chart, the song jumped to #30. \"Candy Shop\" then jumped to #8 in its third week. In its fourth week, the song charted at #2. It peaked at #1 in its fifth week, where it remained for nine straight weeks. It remained on the chart for 23 weeks. The track reached number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Hot Rap Tracks, and Rhythmic Top 40 charts. The song also did well on pop-oriented charts, reaching #2 on the Pop 100 and #5 on the Top 40 Mainstream. \"Candy Shop\" was helped on the Hot 100 and Pop 100 by its strong digital downloads, peaking at #1 on the Hot Digital Songs. The RIAA certified the track Platinum in 2006. Across Europe, the song reached number one in Austria, Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland, and the top five in Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In Australia, the track peaked at number three, was certified"

Released following a highly publicized campaign by G-Unit, to release Tony Yayo from prison prior to the song's release, \"So Seductive\" is an uptempo \"club banger\" containing elements of string instruments and a repetitive bassline in its instrumentation. The song received little promotion from Tony Yayo at the time of its release, as he was still under house arrest following the end of his prison sentence, although he has since performed the song during various live performances.\n\"So Seductive\" became Tony Yayo's most commercially successful song, peaking at number 48 on the Billboard Hot 100; it also remains Tony Yayo's only song to chart outside the United States, peaking in the top 30 of the Irish and United Kingdom singles charts. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its energy and 50 Cent's performance in the chorus, although some wrote negatively towards Yayo's rapping and also noted a lack of originality in the song's production. \"So Seductive\" was nominated for best \"Club Banger\" at the 2005 Vibe Awards, but lost to \"1 Thing\" by Amerie.\nOn December 31, 2002, G-Unit rappers Tony Yayo and 50 Cent were arrested for illegal weapon possession. Following a further background check, it was discovered that Yayo had an outstanding warrant for a previous such charge: as a result, he was sentenced for bail jumping, and spent the entirety of 2003 in prison at Lakeview Shock Incarceration Correctional Facility. During this time, G-Unit rose to mainstream prominence following the commercial success of 50 Cent's album Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003), which sold 872,000 copies in its 1st week on sale in the United States and contained the Billboard number 1 singles \"In Da Club\" and \"21 Questions\". The group also released their debut album, Beg for Mercy, in 2003, which featured the US top-15 singles \"Stunt 101\" and \"Wanna Get to Know You\". Yayo appeared on the song \"Like My Style\", which appears on Get Rich or Die Tryin', and on the songs \"Groupie Love\" and \"I Smell Pussy\", which are included on Beg for Mercy.\nDuring Tony Yayo's incarceration, G-Unit began a campaign called \"Free Yayo\", which involved wearing \"Free Yayo\" shirts advertising his situation; due to the mainstream prominence of the group, Tony Yayo began to receive increased attention from the Hip Hop community, becoming known as the \"mythical 4th member of G-Unit\", although Yayo himself was unaware of the coverage he attracted. The campaign received widespread publicity, even in countries such as Brazil and Iraq. At the 46th Grammy Awards, 50 Cent and Eminem performed whilst wearing \"Free Yayo\" shirts. Yayo watched the performance on television in prison after receiving a call from the Shady offices advising him to do so; he had never seen the shirts before, and was inspired by them to work hard to improve his rapping before his release from prison. He was granted parole from his sentence on January 8, 2004, but was discovered to be in possession of a forged passport, following a check from his parole officer, and was sent back to prison until May 25, 2004.\nFollowing his release, Tony Yayo appeared on several mixtapes to increase his exposure amongst underground hip hop audiences, and began to record his debut album, titled Thoughts of a Predicate Felon (2005), almost immediately after leaving prison, although he was still detained under house arrest and required to wear an ankle bracelet, and thus could not personally promote any of the album's material. \"So Seductive\" was released as the album's 1st single via Interscope in the United States and Canada on May 17, 2005 via Music download, and was released to rhythmic and urban contemporary radio stations in the United States on May 24, 2005. The CD single was distributed via Polydor Records.\nThe song was featured in the 2005 Xbox video game 50 Cent Bulletproof. Tony Yayo appears in the video game providing his own voice and likeness and is a playable character in arcade mode.\n\"So Seductive\" was written by Tony Yayo, 50 Cent and Michael Harper, and was produced by the latter under his production name Punch, who was also responsible for the song's instruments.

Swift wrote the song with Liz Rose, and Nathan Chapman produced it. Big Machine Records released \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" on February 19, 2007, as the album's second single in the United States. The song was later included on the non-US editions of Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008), and released in the United Kingdom in 2009.\nSwift wrote the lyrics inspired by her unrequited love for a high school classmate. Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar. Critics have queried the song's classification as country music, with those in agreement (such as Grady Smith of Rolling Stone) citing the themes and narrative style as country-influenced and those opposed (such as Roger Holland of PopMatters) indicating the pop music production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements. Critics reacted positively to the track, complimenting Swift's vocal delivery and songwriting style. \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was Swift's first pop radio crossover single on the Mainstream Top 40. The single was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nIts music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy and features Swift as she sees her love interest develop a relationship with another female. The video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, but lost to Tokio Hotel's music video for \"Ready, Set, Go!\". The song was promoted through multiple live performances, some while supporting as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. She also performed \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour (2009\u201310).\nSwift was inspired to write \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for. Hardwick later went on to join the United States Navy. During their freshman year at Hendersonville High School in Hendersonville, Tennessee, Swift and Hardwick sat beside each other in class everyday. The two became friends, although Swift secretly desired for them to become a couple. Because of Hardwick's unawareness, he would frequently speak to Swift about another girl he had feelings for, something Swift pretended to be endeared by, commenting, \"How beautiful she was, how nice and smart and perfect she was. And I sat there and listened, never meaning it any of the times I said 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.'\" Hardwick and his crush eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years. Swift never confessed her feelings to him. By the release of Taylor Swift, he remained unaware of Swift's intentions or of the song and continued his relationship with the same female. Upon \"Teardrops on My Guitar\"'s release as a single, Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls, which Swift did not respond to; he then left voicemails, but Swift felt too awkward to call back.\nTwo years after the album's release, as she was leaving her house to attend a Nashville Predators hockey game with Kellie Pickler and Carrie Underwood, Hardwick appeared at her driveway. A car parked and, out of it, exited Hardwick and a friend of his. After two and a half years of not speaking, the two conversed: \"He was like, 'Hey, how's it going?' And I'm like, 'Wow, you're late. Good to see you.' But we were civilized.\" Swift conjectured multiple theories as to why Hardwick appeared at her house. One of them was that he was attempting to prove to his friend that he was indeed the subject of \"Teardrops on My Guitar\". Other possibilities was that he wanted to rebuild their friendship or believed Swift was still pining away from him. Swift said it would have been poetic if he approached her upon the album's release and she would have accepted, but that she had already moved on. Swift cited \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" as an example of how she expresses her sentiments in songs and sometimes in no other manner. She was not afraid of using Hardwick's first name on the track and, therefore, believed it was very honest and susceptible, something she adored.\n\"Teardrops on My Guitar\" is a country pop song with a length of three minutes and 35 seconds. It is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute.  It is written in the key of B\u266d major and Swift's vocals span one"

It was written by Swift and Liz Rose, and produced by Nathan Chapman, and was released on June 19, 2006 by Big Machine Records as the lead single from Swift's self-titled debut album. She wrote \"Tim McGraw\" during her freshman year of high school, knowing that she and her senior boyfriend would break up at the end of the year when he left for college. The song was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together once he departed, such as the songs by Tim McGraw, one of Swift's favorite county artists. \"Tim McGraw\" blends traditional and modern country music.\n\"Tim McGraw\" performed well commercially. The track spent various weeks on both the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs; it peaked at number 40 on the former and number six on the latter. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold more than one million copies since its release. The accompanying music video for \"Tim McGraw\", directed by Trey Fanjoy, comprises flashbacks by Swift's love interest, among cut scenes that feature Swift lying on a lake bed. \"Tim McGraw\" was promoted by Swift on a radio tour and performances in numerous venues. Swift performed it while serving as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. She also performed it as part of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour (2009\u201310). The single was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), indicating more than 2 million units sold in the US.\nTaylor Swift and Liz Rose wrote \"Tim McGraw\" during Swift's freshman year at Hendersonville High School. She conceived the idea in the midst of her mathematics class: \"I was just sitting there, and I started humming this melody.\" She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment. Swift knew that she and her senior boyfriend would break up at the end of the year when he left for college. In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music, \"with the idea and the melody, knowing exactly what she wanted.\" She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone. It was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. \"To her surprise, the first thing that came to mind was [her] love of Tim McGraw's music.\" Several personal details were listed for the song. McGraw's mentioning was a reference to Swift's favorite song, \"Can't Tell Me Nothin\" from his 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying, rather than McGraw as a person. The writing process, as with \"Our Song\", took place in approximately twenty minutes, and was executed with the use of a piano.\nSoon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to his newly formed label. Early into the album production, in a meeting where Borchetta and Swift discussed potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed \"Tim McGraw\" for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, \"That's your first single.\" She responded, \"Well. That's how that works then.\" Prior to that event, Swift did not believe that the song was single material. However, she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct. Swift placed \"Tim McGraw\" as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her. The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19, 2006. In retrospect, Swift has said that the song \"is reminiscent, and it is thinking about a relationship you had and then lost. I think one of the most powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn't... That was a really good song to start out on, because a lot of people can relate to wanting something you can't have.\" When the song's subject discovered it, he thought it was \"cool\" and kept friendship with Swift despite their breakup.\n\"Tim McGraw\" is a country song with a length of three minutes and 52 seconds. The song mingles traditional and modern country music features, primarily through its usage of a twelve-string guitar. It is categorized as a ballad with a mid-paced nature. Written in the key of C major, the song makes heavy use of the"

Swift wrote the song with Liz Rose, and Nathan Chapman produced it. Big Machine Records released \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" on February 19, 2007, as the album's second single in the United States. The song was later included on the non-US editions of Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008), and released in the United Kingdom in 2009.\nSwift wrote the lyrics inspired by her unrequited love for a high school classmate. Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar. Critics have queried the song's classification as country music, with those in agreement (such as Grady Smith of Rolling Stone) citing the themes and narrative style as country-influenced and those opposed (such as Roger Holland of PopMatters) indicating the pop music production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements. Critics reacted positively to the track, complimenting Swift's vocal delivery and songwriting style. \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was Swift's first pop radio crossover single on the Mainstream Top 40. The single was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nIts music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy and features Swift as she sees her love interest develop a relationship with another female. The video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, but lost to Tokio Hotel's music video for \"Ready, Set, Go!\".

It was released on February 18, 2017, by Polydor Records and Interscope Records, as the lead single from her fifth studio album, Lust for Life (2017). The song was written and produced by Del Rey, Benny Blanco, Emile Haynie and Rick Nowels, with additional production by Kieron Menzies. Its release was first teased with promotional posters hung in Los Angeles on February 17, after which the release date was pushed up due to leaked versions of the song surfacing online the same day.\nThe song received acclaim from critics. Eve Barlow of Pitchfork wrote that \"'Love' is an ode to allowing yourself to feel\" and that it \"reassures the listener that the feeling can still lift, that love can still conquer.\" Barlow also gave the song the Best New Track designation. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone called the song \"anthemic\" and Frank Guan of Vulture called \"Love\" \"marvellously good\".\nPitchfork listed \"Love\" as the 28th-best song of 2017 in their annual ranking.\n\"Love\" debuted at No. 44 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it her highest-charting song on the chart since Ultraviolence's lead single, \"West Coast\". It also debuted at No. 2 on Hot Rock Songs, exceeding the No. 3 peak of \"Young and Beautiful\" in 2013. \"Love\" also launched as her first No. 1 on Rock Digital Song Sales (46,000 downloads sold, according to Nielsen Music) and at No. 5 on Rock Streaming Songs (6.6 million domestic streams). The song also peaked at No. 9 on the Digital Songs chart.\nThe music video was in production in June 2016, as reported by BreatheHeavy.com. Del Rey's hairstylist, Anna Cofone, also shared photos of her makeup kit on set on Instagram, which she later deleted.\nOn February 20, 2017, Del Rey announced the music video on an Instagram livestream. Shortly after the livestream it was made available on YouTube. The music video garnered over 19 million views within a week.\nThe music video begins in black and white, showing Del Rey singing on stage in front of a small audience, intercut with young adult couples getting ready for a day at the beach. As Del Rey sings the chorus, the video fades into color, and scenes of the couples floating through the solar system in their cars and alone. Towards the end of the video, Del Rey is also seen performing with her band on the surface of the moon, with the camera turning to the sky, where a symbolic black hole can be seen. It was directed by Rich Lee.\nDaniel Kreps of Rolling Stone called the video \"dreamy\", while writing that the clip \"alternates between black-and-white and washed-out color, Del Rey sings \"Love\" juxtaposed with footage of people \"young and in love.\" Kelsey J. Waite of A.V Club wrote that \"'Love' sends you tumbling through space\", calling it a \"stunning sci-fi video\". Luke Morgan Britton of NME wrote that \"The video sees Del Rey dramatically performing in Space\", while Ben Kaye of Consequence of Sound called the clip \"romantic\".\nDel Rey first performed \"Love\" at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas on March 17, 2017.\nThe song can be heard in the pilot episode of the television show Siesta Key. Los Angeles music producers DJDS and Empress Of also released a collaborative synth-pop cover of the song on December 1, 2017, via Loma Vista Recordings\n\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nManagement\nPublished by Heavy Crate Publishing (ASCAP) / Universal Music Publishing Group\nPublished by Sony/ATV Music Publishing\nPublished by Please Don't Forget to Pay Me Music.\nAll rights administered by EMI April Music Inc. and Universal Music Publishing Group\nPersonnel\nLana Del Rey\u00a0\u2013 vocals, production\nBenny Blanco\u00a0\u2013 production, keyboard, drums, mixing\nMike Bozzi\u00a0\u2013 mastering\nEmile Haynie\u00a0\u2013 production, mixing, synthesizer\nKieron Menzies\u00a0\u2013 production, engineering, mixing\nRick Nowels\u00a0\u2013 production, keyboard, bass guitar, drums, mellotron, vibraphone\nDean Reid\u00a0\u2013 engineering, electric guitar\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung, Kevin (22 February 2017). \"TODAY'S SONG: LANA DEL REY IS NOT ENOUGH, BUT YOUNG AND IN \"LOVE\"\".

It is the third single from Underwood's second studio album, Carnival Ride. It was released in the United States on April 7, 2008, by which point the song had already charted. At the 51st Grammy Awards, the song won Underwood her third consecutive Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. It has sold 1,300,000 copies to date.\nThe song is one of four tracks on the album co-written by Underwood, and the third consecutive one to be released as a single from the album.\nThe song is a moderate up-tempo describing a woman meeting a man at a club and later eloping with him in Las Vegas after having had too much to drink that night. She wakes up the next morning, \"thinkin' 'bout Elvis somewhere in Vegas\", to discover that she does not even know her last name (i.e., she married the man while she was intoxicated), and worries that her \"mama would be so ashamed.\" The music video portrays the song as a prequel to her \"Before He Cheats\" song, even going so far as to hire the same actor to play the man in question.\nThe single was generally met with mixed reviews.\nAllmusic picked the song as a \"track pick\", calling the song \"Miranda Lambert filtered through Shania Twain\", and dubbed it a \"one night stand anthem.\" Rolling Stone picked the track as their favorite, saying \"the most fun is \"Last Name,\" where she gets wasted and runs off to Vegas with a guy she doesn't know.\" Blender awarded the song four out of five stars, describing the song as the \"most irresponsible (and fun) moment on the new album involves one wild night, one too many shots of Cuervo and one unexpected ring.\" Billboard gave a positive review of the track, praising the lyrics: \"It's a cleverly penned lyric that hilariously celebrates drunken debauchery\" as well as summing it up as \"a performance that combines soulful vocals, edgy intensity and sassy attitude into a delicious cocktail.\"\nHowever, it also received some negative reviews: Engine 145 gave the song a 'thumbs down', describing the song as a \"straight-laced performance\" that just \"places the focus on the vocal\". Slant Magazine labelled the single as a \"bald-faced attempt at recreating the 'Before He Cheats' phenomenon\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwood performed the song live for the first time on television during the 43rd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards on May 18, 2008. She performed the song live at the seventh season finale of American Idol on May 21, 2008. She performed the song at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009.\nThe song is described in the video as what happened before the \"Before He Cheats\" video.\nThe video starts with some segments from \"Before He Cheats\" and then goes into a scene three months earlier (\"before he cheated\", it says) with her in the club drinking with her friends. The same man from the \"Before He Cheats\" spots her and asks her for a dance. From this point on, while the guy is with Underwood, he is flirting with every other woman he sees. After the dance, Underwood leaves with the guy in his car with fuzzy dice in the rear view mirror. They make it out to Las Vegas where they participate in a couple of gambling activities such as roulette and a Wheel of Fortune game where they win a new truck. Later they get married in a chapel with an Elvis impersonator officiating. They run off in his new pickup truck (the one used in \"Before He Cheats\") and the video ends with a spark from the chapel sign lights.\nThe song debuted at number 46 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, nearly a month before the single's official release. For the week of June 21, 2008 it rose from number five to number one, to become her fifth straight number one on the Billboard chart, her seventh straight number one country single, and her eighth number one Billboard single overall. This marked Underwood as the first solo female artist to have five consecutive number one's on the country survey in almost 20 years, since Rosanne Cash had a string of six number one titles between 1987 and 1989. It is the third country number one from Carnival Ride and reached the top of the chart faster than the first two singles, taking only 13 weeks. \"Last Name\" has sold 1,300,000 downloads as of November 2015.\nOn the Hot 100 the song reached number 19, making it Underwood's fifth top 20 Hot 100 hit, and the second from Carnival Ride.\n\n\n\nKristin Chenoweth performed a cover of the song"

The song was written in 1999 by frontman Fran Healy while produced by Nigel Godrich and recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles. It was released as the album's lead single in the United States on 23 April 2001. Healy originally titled \"the melody \"Swing\" but eventually changed the title for the song to \"Sing\", making it about working past the troubles of a relationship by not being afraid to let oneself go and sing in front of a loved one. The song is noted for its prominent use of the banjo, played by lead guitarist Andy Dunlop, and contains a string arrangement performed by Millennia Strings.\n\"Sing\" received acclaim from contemporary music critics, who often praised its writing and production. The song became the band's highest-charting single in their home country, peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart. It was a worldwide success as well, reaching the top 10 in several other European countries, including France, peaking at number two, and New Zealand. In the US, the song reached the top 40 of the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs and Modern Rock Tracks charts.\nA music video for the song was released on 20 April 2001\u2014it was directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. Filmed in Pasadena, California over three days, it features Travis attending a dinner party that eventually turns into a massive food fight. When Travis appeared on British music programme Top of the Pops, the band members threw pies at each other and the audience while the track played in the background. The video was nominated for Best British Video at the 2002 Brit Awards.\nFran Healy explained on the band's official website that he wrote the song in 1999 the day before he planned to go to the studio to record the B-sides for their 1999 single\" \"Turn\". He came up with the song as he watched a swingbeat video on MTV, leading him to compose a basic melody called \"Swing\" on his guitar. Healy liked the results and said that he appreciated the free chorus and verse melody. \"It really felt like it took to the air\", he said on the band's official website. The following day, after recording the B-side \"We Are Monkeys\", Healy began to play the song's chords while the track was rewinding, and the rest of his bandmates soon joined him. Healy then asked for the production of \"We Are Monkeys\" to be put on hold so they could record a demo of the new composition. As he performed with the rest of Travis, he changed the word \"swing\" to \"sing\" on the chorus. Since lead guitarist Andy Dunlop had brought his banjo into the studio for \"We Are Monkeys\", the instrument was overdubbed into the recording.\nThe night after recording the demo, Healy decided to change all instances of \"swing\" to \"sing\" and modify the lyrics so that the song described the healing powers of singing. The track was recorded between October 2000 and March 2001 at Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, California, and was included on The Invisible Band as the opening track. Along with \"Flowers in the Window\", Healy dedicated the song to his wife Nora Kryst in the album booklet. In the United States, record label Independiente added \"Sing\" to triple A radio on 23 April 2001 and to alternative radio the following day, while in the United Kingdom, the label serviced the song to radio during the same month and issued it as a physical single on 28 May 2001. The song was released on CD in Australia on the same day.\nMusically, \"Sing\" is a pop song with folk elements, which includes a banjo played by Dunlop. Robert Wilonsky of the Dallas Observer described the song as \"front-porch blues, if your front porch opens onto central London\". Set in common time, it is written in the key of F\u266f minor and has a tempo of 80 beats per minute. Healy sings lead vocals and plays guitar while Dougie Payne plays bass and Neil Primrose plays the drums. Dunlop additionally plays piano on the song. The song begins with a synth chord that leads into a rhythm consisting of strumming guitars and the banjo. Additional strings"

The song was written by Zach Crowell, Brett James, and Hillary Lindsey, with production from Mark Bright, and was released as the third single from the album in the United States, being shipped to radio on April 3, 2016, and had an official impact date of April 11, 2016.\n\"Church Bells\" topped the Billboard Country Airplay chart, becoming Underwood's 15th leader on that chart and thereby extending her record as the female artist with most number-ones in history of that chart. It is her second number one from Storyteller on the Country Airplay chart. Underwood became the first woman in 2016 to have two number-ones on the chart. The song was certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA on July 23, 2020.\nThe song was nominated for Best Country Solo Performance at the 59th Grammy Awards.\nChurch Bells tells the story of Jenny, a poor girl who marries a rich oilman. However, she soon discovers her new husband is an abusive alcoholic. Jenny slips an untraceable poison into his drink and kills him.\nUnderwood said of the song, \"It's...like Fancy's little sister\", referencing Bobbie Gentry's hit song \"Fancy\", made famous by Reba McEntire. \u201cShe\u2019s young, she\u2019s pretty, she\u2019s poor, doing what she can to survive,\u201d Underwood explains, describing her \u201cChurch Bells\u201d heroine. \u201c(She) meets a man that has a lot of wealth and is supposed to take care of her.\u201d\nThe song received generally positive reviews. In their review of the album, Billboard said of the song, \"The first half holds a pair of Southern-gothic blockbusters that are the closest she has come to channeling McEntire\u2019s down-home storytelling: \u201cChoctaw County Affair,\u201d a tale of lovers silencing their would-be blackmailer, and \u201cChurch Bells,\u201d a rags-to-riches murder ballad in which a woman quietly offs her abusive husband.\" Rolling Stone called it \"the most epic domestic-violence-revenge-murder ballad in years\" and that it \"split the difference between Martina McBride's \"Independence Day\" and the Dixie Chicks \"Goodbye Earl\", but without the latter's safety-valve of humor.\"\nIn a mixed review, website Taste of Country said, \"on \u201cChurch Bells\u201d Underwood injects new drama into an oft-told tale. The Dixie Chicks \u201cGoodbye Earl\u201d relies on the same plot points, with Earl's fate being the same as the oil baron in this song\". The review was concluded by saying \"expect the song to perform well on country radio, even if it\u2019s not one that pushes her artistry forward as much as others on her most recent studio album\".\n\"Church Bells\" first charted at number 49 on the Hot Country Songs chart, selling 2,300 copies following the release of the parent album. It fell off the chart in the following week. After its release as the third official single and following Underwood's performance at the 51st Annual Academy of Country Music Awards, the song re-entered the Hot Country Songs chart at number 34 and peaked at number two, spending three consecutive weeks at that spot. It debuted at number 50 on the US Country Airplay chart and peaked at number one, becoming Underwood's 15th number one on that chart and extending her record for most number ones among women on that chart. Underwood became the first female artist of 2016 to have two number one hits on the Country Airplay chart, with \"Heartbeat\" and \"Church Bells\".\nFor the week ending May 28, 2016, it debuted at number 90 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and peaked at number 43.\nIn Canada, the song debuted at number 37 on the Canada Country chart and peaked at number two and debuted at number 100 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart and peaked at number 64.\nThe song has been certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA on July 23, 2020. As of January 2017, it has sold 456,000 copies in the United States.\nThe music video for the single was filmed  during the Storyteller Tour in Lincoln, Nebraska. The music video was released on May 10, 2016, and premiered on Good Morning America.\nUnderwood first performed the song live on the first stop of the Storyteller Tour in Jacksonville, Florida. She has since performed the song numerous times during the tour. Underwood's first televised performance of the song was at the 51st Annual Academy of Country Music Awards. She again performed the song live at the 2016 American Country Countdown Awards.\nUnderwood performed the song at the 2016 CMT Music Awards on June 8, 2016.

It is the third single from Underwood's second studio album, Carnival Ride. It was released in the United States on April 7, 2008, by which point the song had already charted. At the 51st Grammy Awards, the song won Underwood her third consecutive Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. It has sold 1,300,000 copies to date.\nThe song is one of four tracks on the album co-written by Underwood, and the third consecutive one to be released as a single from the album.\nThe song is a moderate up-tempo describing a woman meeting a man at a club and later eloping with him in Las Vegas after having had too much to drink that night. She wakes up the next morning, \"thinkin' 'bout Elvis somewhere in Vegas\", to discover that she does not even know her last name (i.e., she married the man while she was intoxicated), and worries that her \"mama would be so ashamed.\" The music video portrays the song as a prequel to her \"Before He Cheats\" song, even going so far as to hire the same actor to play the man in question.\nThe single was generally met with mixed reviews.\nAllmusic picked the song as a \"track pick\", calling the song \"Miranda Lambert filtered through Shania Twain\", and dubbed it a \"one night stand anthem.\" Rolling Stone picked the track as their favorite, saying \"the most fun is \"Last Name,\" where she gets wasted and runs off to Vegas with a guy she doesn't know.\" Blender awarded the song four out of five stars, describing the song as the \"most irresponsible (and fun) moment on the new album involves one wild night, one too many shots of Cuervo and one unexpected ring.\" Billboard gave a positive review of the track, praising the lyrics: \"It's a cleverly penned lyric that hilariously celebrates drunken debauchery\" as well as summing it up as \"a performance that combines soulful vocals, edgy intensity and sassy attitude into a delicious cocktail.\"\nHowever, it also received some negative reviews: Engine 145 gave the song a 'thumbs down', describing the song as a \"straight-laced performance\" that just \"places the focus on the vocal\". Slant Magazine labelled the single as a \"bald-faced attempt at recreating the 'Before He Cheats' phenomenon\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwood performed the song live for the first time on television during the 43rd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards on May 18, 2008. She performed the song live at the seventh season finale of American Idol on May 21, 2008. She performed the song at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009.\nThe song is described in the video as what happened before the \"Before He Cheats\" video.\nThe video starts with some segments from \"Before He Cheats\" and then goes into a scene three months earlier (\"before he cheated\", it says) with her in the club drinking with her friends. The same man from the \"Before He Cheats\" spots her and asks her for a dance. From this point on, while the guy is with Underwood, he is flirting with every other woman he sees. After the dance, Underwood leaves with the guy in his car with fuzzy dice in the rear view mirror. They make it out to Las Vegas where they participate in a couple of gambling activities such as roulette and a Wheel of Fortune game where they win a new truck. Later they get married in a chapel with an Elvis impersonator officiating. They run off in his new pickup truck (the one used in \"Before He Cheats\") and the video ends with a spark from the chapel sign lights.\nThe song debuted at number 46 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, nearly a month before the single's official release. For the week of June 21, 2008 it rose from number five to number one, to become her fifth straight number one on the Billboard chart, her seventh straight number one country single, and her eighth number one Billboard single overall. This marked Underwood as the first solo female artist to have five consecutive number one's on the country survey in almost 20 years, since Rosanne Cash had a string of six number one titles between 1987 and 1989.

Grady Smith of UK's The Guardian acclaimed it, by stating \"among all the great music we've been treated to this summer, no song has carried more significance than Carrie Underwood\u2019s excellent new single 'Smoke Break'. Here we have an A-list star releasing an unabashed country rock song that isn't trying to chase any sonic trends\". He also added that Underwood \"has emerged as the leader of country music\". Denise Quan of Rolling Stone praised the song, saying that the singer \"pays homage to hard working people in need of a breather\" and adding that Underwood puts \"a bit more twang in her vocals than usual \u2014 a welcome dose of laid-back country cool after a string of glossy, high-octane arena rockers and soaring ballads\". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard awarded it 3.5 starts out of a possible five, noting Underwood's departure from previous material and stating that \"the normally overpolished American Idol winner wears the song's blue-collar country-rock vibe well\". Hugh McIntyre of Forbes praised it, saying its lines evokes \"some pretty sentimental themes that likely connect with a lot of people\" and the song \"has the makings of another runaway hit on radio\".\nDee Lockett of Vulture praised it, pointing out that \"just as songs about getting trashed will remain a rite of passage in country music, its superstars like Carrie Underwood will continue to find ways to keep them meaningful\". Kevin John of Country Universe praised Underwood's songwriting by saying that \"she has the finest singing voice of her generation, but her greatest gift is her ability to express empathy for others through song\". Taste of Country praised the song as well, stating that \"it's a song everyone can relate to\" and \"is easy to wear, and adaptable to life's changing circumstances\", and praised Underwood's delivery, saying \"she starts soft before soaring into the chorus\". Robert Christgau deemed it as Storyteller's most impressive song, \"cross-regional, cross-gender, class-conscious ... in which neither the mother of four working three jobs nor the farm family's first college man can do without the occasional drag or drink, sincere Christians though they be\".\nWSM-FM and WKDF Nashville Program Director Charlie Cook praised the song as well, saying \"the lyrics\naddress the hectic lives everyone now lives, and the production stands out as a testament that she is willing to take chances, yet play within what her fans expect\". iHeartMedia Senior VP of Programming Gator Harrison said the song is \u201can anthem for the overwhelmed, something we can all relate to, and amen. It's a smash\".\n\"Smoke Break\" garnered some controversy upon its release, after some listeners accused the song of \"trying to promote smoking\". Journalists for vehicles such as Vulture and USA Today went on to defend the song. Dee Lockett of"

It is the third single from Underwood's second studio album, Carnival Ride. It was released in the United States on April 7, 2008, by which point the song had already charted. At the 51st Grammy Awards, the song won Underwood her third consecutive Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. It has sold 1,300,000 copies to date.\nThe song is one of four tracks on the album co-written by Underwood, and the third consecutive one to be released as a single from the album.\nThe song is a moderate up-tempo describing a woman meeting a man at a club and later eloping with him in Las Vegas after having had too much to drink that night. She wakes up the next morning, \"thinkin' 'bout Elvis somewhere in Vegas\", to discover that she does not even know her last name (i.e., she married the man while she was intoxicated), and worries that her \"mama would be so ashamed.\" The music video portrays the song as a prequel to her \"Before He Cheats\" song, even going so far as to hire the same actor to play the man in question.\nThe single was generally met with mixed reviews.\nAllmusic picked the song as a \"track pick\", calling the song \"Miranda Lambert filtered through Shania Twain\", and dubbed it a \"one night stand anthem.\" Rolling Stone picked the track as their favorite, saying \"the most fun is \"Last Name,\" where she gets wasted and runs off to Vegas with a guy she doesn't know.\" Blender awarded the song four out of five stars, describing the song as the \"most irresponsible (and fun) moment on the new album involves one wild night, one too many shots of Cuervo and one unexpected ring.\" Billboard gave a positive review of the track, praising the lyrics: \"It's a cleverly penned lyric that hilariously celebrates drunken debauchery\" as well as summing it up as \"a performance that combines soulful vocals, edgy intensity and sassy attitude into a delicious cocktail.\"\nHowever, it also received some negative reviews: Engine 145 gave the song a 'thumbs down', describing the song as a \"straight-laced performance\" that just \"places the focus on the vocal\". Slant Magazine labelled the single as a \"bald-faced attempt at recreating the 'Before He Cheats' phenomenon\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwood performed the song live for the first time on television during the 43rd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards on May 18, 2008. She performed the song live at the seventh season finale of American Idol on May 21, 2008. She performed the song at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009.\nThe song is described in the video as what happened before the \"Before He Cheats\" video.\nThe video starts with some segments from \"Before He Cheats\" and then goes into a scene three months earlier (\"before he cheated\", it says) with her in the club drinking with her friends. The same man from the \"Before He Cheats\" spots her and asks her for a dance. From this point on, while the guy is with Underwood, he is flirting with every other woman he sees. After the dance, Underwood leaves with the guy in his car with fuzzy dice in the rear view mirror. They make it out to Las Vegas where they participate in a couple of gambling activities such as roulette and a Wheel of Fortune game where they win a new truck. Later they get married in a chapel with an Elvis impersonator officiating. They run off in his new pickup truck (the one used in \"Before He Cheats\") and the video ends with a spark from the chapel sign lights.\nThe song debuted at number 46 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, nearly a month before the single's official release. For the week of June 21, 2008 it rose from number five to number one, to become her fifth straight number one on the Billboard chart, her seventh straight number one country single, and her eighth number one Billboard single overall. This marked Underwood as the first solo female artist to have five consecutive number one's on the country survey in almost 20 years, since Rosanne Cash had a string of six number one titles between 1987 and 1989. It is the third country number one from Carnival Ride and reached the top of the chart faster than the first two singles, taking only 13 weeks. \"Last Name\" has sold 1,300,000 downloads as of November 2015.\nOn the Hot 100 the song reached number 19, making it Underwood's fifth top 20 Hot 100 hit, and the second from Carnival Ride.\n\n\n\nKristin Chenoweth performed a cover of the song"

The song was released through RCA Records on February 14, 2018, as the second single from the film's soundtrack. It was written by Khalid, Normani, Jamil Chammas, Ryan Vojtesak and Tayla Parx, with production handled by Charlie Handsome and Digi. The song marked Normani's first single release outside of Fifth Harmony.\n\"Love Lies\" debuted at 43 on the US Billboard Hot 100, breaking the record for the highest first-week position for a debut single by a girl group member; before eventually peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on US pop radio, while also reaching the top ten in six additional countries. The song was certified 5x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over five million units. It was also certified diamond in Brazil, 5x platinum in Australia, and platinum or higher in five additional countries.\nIt was also the most Shazammed R&B song of 2018. \"Love Lies\" spent a record-tying 45 weeks on Billboard's Mainstream Top 40 radio airplay chart. In 2019, Billboard named it the seventh biggest song of the 2010s decade on the Mainstream Top 40 chart. In 2021, the song was revealed to be the fifth most thumbed up duet on Pandora.\nNormani first hinted at a possible collaboration between her and Khalid via an Instagram post in July 2017. Khalid also opened up about the collaboration during an interview with MTV News the next month. Later, Normani confirmed to Billboard that they were working together on collaboration ideas, calling him \"an important artist and a great friend\". She divulged to Kode in an interview in October 2017, when asked to share information on the collaboration: \nKhalid and I have been wanting to work together for some time. We actually got into the studio and were excited about a record we wrote together along with Taylor Parks. It was all one huge vibe session. We wanted to create something that our peers would fall in love with. I remember him telling me \"I want this to be my favorite record, if I were listening, I want it to be something I vibe with that's just dope,\" which is something I relate to because I listen to our song every day. Issa vibe. But the greatest part of it all is that were genuinely two friends that created something special that were so proud of. We're in two different countries on tour but we still text each other sometimes like, \"but that record though...\"\nThe duet was officially announced on January 16, 2018. On February 12, 2018, Normani posted a photograph of her and Khalid, captioning the photo: \"2/14\". Similarly, Khalid posted the single artwork with the same caption. The two artists also teased a few lyrics from the song, with Khalid replying Normani's announcement with \"tell me where your love lies\", to which Normani replied: \"waste the day and spend the night\". Normani spoke to Zane Lowe on his Beats 1 radio show about the song, saying that recording it was a \"growing process\" for her. \"I feel like people are actually getting like a sense of who I actually am,\" she said. \"Being in the studio and partnering with Khalid, it actually tells me more about myself that I didn't necessarily know was even there. This is definitely [a] growing process and I can't wait. I'm so excited for the journey.\"\nNina Braca of Billboard wrote a positive review of the song, saying: \"The romantically curious lyrics perfectly compliment Normani's smooth vocals over a simple guitar riff and slow pop beat.\" Hugh McIntyre of Fuse deemed the song \"a laid-back R&B affair so mature it's difficult to believe the artists behind it are so young and still just getting started in their respective careers\". He called the production \"a natural progression\" for Khalid and something \"not far from Normani's comfort zone\", and displaying herself as a   \u201dsex symbol\u201d. He also praised the guitar loop, calling it \"a nice touch on a beat that is fairly sparse, and at times, nonexistent\", writing that \"it helps this song stand out among the hundreds of other similar tracks\". Sam Damshenas of Gay Times described it as \"incredibly catchy and addictive\". Mike Wass of Idolator opined that \"the dreamy mid-tempo anthem showcases her voice and hints at the R&B/pop direction of her side-project\". Billboard's critics' list placed it second on \"Every Fifth Harmony Solo Single, Ranked\" in March 2018, while \"Love Lies\" topped Billboard's"

They performed the song again at the CMT Music Awards on June 4, 2014.\nThe song received generally favorable response from the critics.  Matt Bjorke of Roughstock thought the song playful, fun, and \"sure to be a fast-selling hit.\" Jason Scott of AXS called it \"a fun, beat-driven summer anthem\" and rated it four stars out of five. Taste of Country said that the song's \"ready-for-anything lyrics and the way that Lambert and Underwood belt them out with such power, make \u2018Somethin\u2019 Bad\u2019 a catchy girl-power anthem.\"\n\"Somethin' Bad\" debuted at No. 39 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart following its release for sales on May 19, 2014 (chart dated June 7, 2014).

Carrie tweeted a pic of her on the bike.

It was released in November 20, 2000 as the third single from Eminem's third album, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000). It reached number one in 12 countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, and Australia.\nThe 45 King-produced track also uses a slightly modified break from \"Thank You\" as its base sample; both songs were released as singles in late 2000. \"Stan\" has been called one of Eminem's best songs and is considered one of his signature songs. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Stan\" 296th on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, upping their ranking to 223rd in a 2021 updated list. The song was also listed 15th on VH1's list of the greatest hiphop songs of all time and named in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\nThe song was nominated for multiple awards, including Best Song at the MTV Europe Music Awards, Video of the Year, Best Rap Video, Best Direction, and Best Cinematography at the MTV Video Music Awards. It won Best International Artist Video at the MuchMusic Video Awards. In April 2011, Complex magazine put together a list of the 100 greatest Eminem songs and ranked \"Stan\" second. The eponymous character's name gave rise to a slang term that refers to overzealous, maniacal, overly obsessed, entitled fans of a celebrity or personality; the term has since been included in the Oxford English Dictionary.\nThe song tells the story of a person named Stanley \"Stan\" Mitchell (voiced by Eminem) who claims to be Eminem's biggest fan. He writes Eminem several letters; over three verses, he becomes more obsessive, and when there is no reply he becomes angrier. He finally creates a voice recording of himself while driving his car on the highway, having consumed large quantities of depressants and alcohol; this verse includes a call-back to Eminem's \"My Name Is\" with the lyrics \"I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?\" He reveals that his pregnant girlfriend is tied up in the trunk as he approaches a bridge, and realizes just before driving off it that he has no way to send the tape to Eminem.\nThe fourth verse features Eminem as himself, writing back to Stan and attempting to reason with him. He warns Stan that he should get help, telling him about a story he heard on the news about a man who had driven his car off a bridge in a drunken stupor, killing himself and his pregnant girlfriend. Eminem then comes to the realization that this man was actually Stan.\nDirected by Dr. Dre and Philip Atwell, the video is a literal interpretation of the story. The video features Devon Sawa as Stan and Dido as his pregnant girlfriend. A prologue involves Stan dyeing his hair blonde and reacting angrily to being called \"Stanley\" by his girlfriend. Later, he sits in a basement full of Eminem's posters, writing letters that express his devotion as \"your [Eminem's] biggest fan\". He is aware of every development in Eminem's personal life.\nStan wants Eminem to contact him through a personal letter or a phone call; but, due to unfortunate circumstances, the letters fail to reach Eminem in a timely manner. Believing he has been ignored, Stan uses a tape recorder to record himself driving along a rain-soaked highway while his girlfriend is locked up in the trunk; which he does with the intention of driving off a bridge. In the process, Stan references both \"My Name Is\" (\"I drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?\") and an urban legend about Phil Collins's \"In the Air Tonight\" before realizing that there is no way of transmitting this final tape to Eminem. The car then breaks through the bridge barrier, sealing both occupants' fates.\nStan's mother and his little brother Matthew visit his grave. When Matthew opens his hoodie, he has dyed his hair blonde like Stan. Eminem finally gets around to responding to Stan. He apologizes for being late, thanks him for being a fan, and expresses interest in Stan's personal life. Eminem worries about Stan's mental state and says he does not want Stan to end up like a story he had seen on the news recently\u2014a man who had driven drunk off a bridge with his girlfriend in the trunk, about whom he then realizes, \"It was you. Damn.\" Unbeknownst to Eminem, flashes of lightning shine on his window, revealing the ghost of Stan silently glaring. The video ends with Matthew staring at"

It was released by Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records as the second single from the album on April 6, 2018, along with its music video. The song was produced by Murda Beatz, Noah \"40\" Shebib and Corey Litwin with co-production handled by Blaqnmild. It features additional vocals by Big Freedia and 5th Ward Weebie. It contains a sample from \"Ex-Factor\", written and performed by Lauryn Hill, which itself samples \"Can It Be All So Simple\", written and performed by Wu-Tang Clan. The latter song also samples \"The Way We Were\". Therefore, Hill, the eight members of Wu-Tang Clan, and Marvin Hamlisch, Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman are credited among the composers.\nIt debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, replacing Drake's own \"God's Plan\" and becoming his fifth US number one. It also topped the UK Singles Chart and ARIA Singles Chart, becoming his second number-one song of 2018 in the two countries after \"God's Plan\". Rolling Stone ranked it 54th on their list of the '100 Best  Songs of the 2010s'. In 2021, The Guardian ranked it number-one on their list of 'Drake's 30 Greatest songs'. The song was awarded two ASCAP Awards, including Top Rap Song, and was nominated for Best Rap Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\nOn March 14, 2018, Lauryn Hill's son Joshua Omaru Marley posted a snippet of the song on Snapchat. Drake later confirmed an upcoming Murda Beatz-produced single during an Instagram Live session. On April 5, Drake made a surprise appearance during a Majid Jordan concert in Toronto. \"The reason I'm here tonight is because I'm back in the city finishing my album,\" he told the audience. \"I've got a new single dropping tomorrow night, too, just in case you got some free time.\"\n\"Nice for What\" is an upbeat bounce song which contains elements of early 2000s R&B, with a length of three minutes thirty seconds. It samples Lauryn Hill's song \"Ex-Factor\" (1998), \"Drag Rap\" by the Showboys (1986), \"Get Your Roll On\" by Big Tymers (2000), and also features clips from performances by Big Freedia. Lyrically, the hook of Drake's song samples Lauryn Hill singing about \"cutting loose in the midst of a relationship\".\nDirected by Karena Evans, the accompanying music video shows women carrying out various activities, including swimming, dancing, modeling, playing with children, horse-riding, and holding a business meeting. It features guest appearances from, in order of appearance, Olivia Wilde, Misty Copeland, Issa Rae, Rashida Jones, Jourdan Dunn, Tracee Ellis Ross, Tiffany Haddish, Yara Shahidi, Zoe Saldana, Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhj\u00e4rta, Letitia Wright, Bria Vinaite, Emma Roberts, Syd, Michelle Rodriguez and Drake himself. Evans called it an honour to work on the video, writing on Instagram that it was \"a privilege and a blessing to have told this story with every single one of you revolutionary women, both in front and behind the camera\".\n\"Nice for What\" received positive reviews from music critics, with many praising its promotion of female empowerment. Hugh McIntyre of Forbes regarded the \"perfectly-pitched\" song as \"another perfect delivery from the biggest artist in hip-hop\", writing that the \"vocal sample helps the track stand out from much of the rest of his discography\". Kevin Lozano of Pitchfork awarded the song \"Best New Track\", praising Drake for \"smoothly handling the impeccable production from Murda Beatz\", and lauding the song as \"a fantastic piece of hip-hop machinery\" and \"one of Drake's most complete releases in some time\".\nChris DeVille of Stereogum deemed the song \"a big, brash, almost obnoxiously loud New Orleans bounce-inspired production\", describing it as \"extremely poppy and sounds like a bid for continued commercial dominance\".\nBillboard named \"Nice for What\" the fifth-best song of 2018. Rolling Stone also named \"Nice for What\" the fifth-best song of 2018, and ranked it 54th on their list of the '100 Best  Songs of the 2010s'.\nIn the United States, Drake became the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace his former number-one debut (\"God's Plan\") at the top of the Hot 100. It debuted with 88,000 downloads sold and 60.4 million streams. \"Nice for What\" became the 30th song in Billboard history"

It is the seventh track on the band's fourth studio album, Ixnay on the Hombre (1997), and was released as its second single. It also appears as the sixth track on Greatest Hits (2005). A piano version of the song features as the eleventh track on the group's tenth studio album Let The Bad Times Roll  (2021). \nThe song became the Offspring's first No. 1 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, while reaching No. 4 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. Through 2009, the band played \"Gone Away\" with Holland performing on piano throughout Europe and the United States. Two of the tracks from this single (\"D.U.I.\" and \"Hey Joe\") appear on the band's 2010 compilation album, Happy Hour!.\n\nAll tracks are written by Dexter Holland, except where noted.\n\n\nThe single reached Gold in Australia, selling 35,000 copies.\nThe footage for the music video, shot in grainy quality, shows the band playing in a dark, and apparently abandoned slaughterhouse. Dexter Holland, for most of the video, sings to a shining hanging light bulb. He is the only band member to interact with this bulb, though other lightbulbs are shown in each band member's respective rooms. Dexter also sings into a suspended microphone which is also used in the video; it swings back and forth as the video fades to black. It was directed by Nigel Dick.\nThe music video appears on the Complete Music Video Collection DVD, released in 2005. The DVD also contains a storyboard version of the video (with the storyboard playing over top the music video).\nThe song was made available as downloadable content in the Rock Band series on October 7, 2008. It appeared in the first Offspring pack along with \"Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)\" and \"Self Esteem\".\n\n\n\n\nFive Finger Death Punch covered the song on their 2017 compilation album, A Decade of Destruction, and on their 2018 studio album, And Justice for None. Their version peaked at No. 2 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Airplay chart in April 2018.\n\"79 Best Alternative Rock Songs of 1997\". Spin. April 25, 2017. p.\u00a02.

It was the fourth single and second track on the first disc from their third album, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, and was released in May 1996 in Europe. \"Tonight, Tonight\" was critically acclaimed and commercially well-received upon its release, reaching number one in Iceland, number two in New Zealand, number seven in the United Kingdom and number 36 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The music video accompanying the song was also successful and won several awards.\nA shorter acoustic version of the song, \"Tonite Reprise\", was included as a B-side to the single and on the triple LP version of Mellon Collie. This single also later appeared in an extended form on the box set The Aeroplane Flies High. Additionally, the song appears on the band's greatest hits release, Rotten Apples.\nBilly Corgan began writing for the follow-up to Siamese Dream after the tour in support of that album; however, the recording of \"Tonight, Tonight\" first began while the Pumpkins were still on the Siamese Dream tour when Corgan booked the band into a local Chicago studio to record all of their song ideas on tape.\nOn The Howard Stern Show, Corgan has said that the song pays homage to Cheap Trick, with its black humoresque lyrics and theme, and that the song is addressed to himself, who escaped from an abusive childhood against all odds, so as to keep him believing in himself.\n\"Tonight, Tonight\" is written in the key of G, performed on instruments tuned down a half-step so the actual pitch is G\u266d/F #. In the original recording sessions, \"Tonight, Tonight\" was initially written in the key of C instead of G. However, since Corgan was unable to sing the song in C, he wrote a version during the Mellon Collie recording sessions to suit his range. The strings for the song were arranged by Billy Corgan and Audrey Riley, and recorded with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Corgan said that recording with a 30-piece string-section for the song \"was probably one of the most exciting recording experiences I have ever had.\"\nLyrically, \"Tonight, Tonight\" hangs together with the rest of the Mellon Collie. The lyrics of the song have been compared to Robert Herrick's poem \"To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time\".\n\"Tonight, Tonight\" was met with critical acclaim. Allmusic reviewer Amy Hanson stated that the song \"packs an emotional punch\". Jim Alexander of NME regarded the song as \"swirling [and] grand\". Music Week rated it four out of five, adding, \"A powerful vocals-led single with ferocious driving guitars. Their most commercial release to date which should gain a high chart placing.\" Time's reviewer Christopher John Farley called the song \"an expansive rock anthem, complete with soaring guitars and a 30-piece string section.\" Entertainment Weekly's reviewer David Browne praised the use of strings in the song, saying that it was \"whipped into a frenzy by hurricane-like strings\". On Mellon Collie's entry in Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, \"Tonight, Tonight\" was praised as \"the Pumpkins at their finest\".\nWhile \"Tonight, Tonight\" never approached the chart success of \"1979\", it was among the most successful singles from Mellon Collie. Its highest position on any national chart was a number two peak on the New Zealand Singles Chart. Its highest position in the United States was at number four on Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks. It also achieved number five on the Modern Rock Tracks and number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at number 21 on the Australian Singles Chart on June 9, 1996. It placed at 50th in a list of best rock songs of all time broadcast by Kerrang! TV.\nThe music video was directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and starred Tom Kenny and Jill Talley, a married couple who were, at the time, cast members on the sketch comedy program Mr. Show with Bob and David and would later gain international fame for their voicework on SpongeBob SquarePants. The original idea for the music video was for a Busby Berkeley-style video, complete with \"people diving into champagne glasses\". The band was set to begin production on the video when they discovered that the Red Hot Chili Peppers had done a similarly styled video for their song \"Aeroplane\", which was almost identical to what they had wanted to do.

The single reached the top 30 in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nA demo version of \"Dog Days Are Over\" is featured on disc two of the deluxe edition of Lungs. A six-minute, forty-second-long Optimo remix of \"Dog Days Are Over\" has also been made available. An acoustic version of the song was performed live on BBC's Radio 1 Big Weekend. The track has been performed at a great number of high-profile festivals through 2008 and 2009, including the Reading and Leeds festivals. The band also performed the song on the Mercury Prize 2009 awards show and BBC Introducing.\n\"Dog Days Are Over\" was recorded with no instruments in a studio the \"size of a loo\". The song was inspired by a giant text installment titled \"Dog Days Are Over\" by artist Ugo Rondinone, which lead singer Florence Welch used to see every day, riding her bike over Waterloo Bridge. The song was produced and mixed by James Ford of Simian Mobile Disco and The Last Shadow Puppets, who is also famous for producing for the likes of Bloc Party and the Arctic Monkeys. He is also credited as playing piano and guitar on the record.\nWelch co-wrote the song with Isabella Summers, who is also credited as the song's co-producer, and played piano on the record. Welch and Summers also teamed up for the percussion on the track, together with Charlie Hugall. \"Dog Days Are Over\" also features musicians Tom \"Moth\" Monger (harp), Bruce White (viola), Everton Nelson (violin), Christopher Lloyd Hayden (drums) and Rob Ackroyd (guitar).\nJimmy Robertson, extensively involved in the recording of the band's debut record Lungs, recorded and mixed \"Dog Days\" as well.\nThe song was re-released into the UK market on 11 April 2010, accompanied with a new video.\n\"Dog Days Are Over\" has been widely praised by music critics, with Welch's vocals being lauded. According to MusicOMH.com, \"'Dog Days Are Over' only seems likely to add to her already burgeoning reputation. While not as immediately catchy as \"Kiss with a Fist,\" it's an urgent, pounding, almost bluesy anthem which shows off Florence's voice to its very best advantage\". Further, the track's B-side, a cover of \"You've Got the Love\", was praised. \"Following with her tradition of some finely chosen cover versions, there's even an excellent rendition of The Source's \"You Got the Love\".\nContactmusic.com rated the song 9/10. The website remarked that \"It's brilliant. It's a masterful yet primal tour-de-force of folk/pop/rock that reveals a beguiling talent that should surely be regarded as one of the finds of the musical year. \"Dog Days Are Over\" succeeds in capturing a powerfully 'live' studio sound that sinks, swells and explodes in a series of unconventional verse/choruses that, accentuated by Welch's snarling\". In October 2011, NME placed it at number 33 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\nOn 6 December 2008, \"Dog Days Are Over\" debuted at number 89 on the UK Singles Chart. The following week it dropped one place to number 90 before dropping out of the top 100. It then re-entered the chart a month later on 17 January 2009 at number 93 before dropping out of the chart again. Approximately four months later the single made another re-entry on 23 May 2009, this time at number 91.\nFollowing performances on Top of the Pops, Jools Holland and uses in television advertisement for Slumdog Millionaire and Eat, Pray, Love, \"Dog Days Are Over\" began to receive increasing amounts of digital downloads, despite not having been re-released. On 10 January 2010, \"Dog Days Are Over\" re-entered the UK Singles Chart at number 23, marking its highest peak to date. However, the following week, on 17 January 2010, the single fell one place to number 24. Following the single's official re-release in March 2010, it"

It was the fourth single and second track on the first disc from their third album, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, and was released in May 1996 in Europe. \"Tonight, Tonight\" was critically acclaimed and commercially well-received upon its release, reaching number one in Iceland, number two in New Zealand, number seven in the United Kingdom and number 36 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The music video accompanying the song was also successful and won several awards.\nA shorter acoustic version of the song, \"Tonite Reprise\", was included as a B-side to the single and on the triple LP version of Mellon Collie. This single also later appeared in an extended form on the box set The Aeroplane Flies High. Additionally, the song appears on the band's greatest hits release, Rotten Apples.\nBilly Corgan began writing for the follow-up to Siamese Dream after the tour in support of that album; however, the recording of \"Tonight, Tonight\" first began while the Pumpkins were still on the Siamese Dream tour when Corgan booked the band into a local Chicago studio to record all of their song ideas on tape.\nOn The Howard Stern Show, Corgan has said that the song pays homage to Cheap Trick, with its black humoresque lyrics and theme, and that the song is addressed to himself, who escaped from an abusive childhood against all odds, so as to keep him believing in himself.\n\"Tonight, Tonight\" is written in the key of G, performed on instruments tuned down a half-step so the actual pitch is G\u266d/F #. In the original recording sessions, \"Tonight, Tonight\" was initially written in the key of C instead of G. However, since Corgan was unable to sing the song in C, he wrote a version during the Mellon Collie recording sessions to suit his range. The strings for the song were arranged by Billy Corgan and Audrey Riley, and recorded with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Corgan said that recording with a 30-piece string-section for the song \"was probably one of the most exciting recording experiences I have ever had.\"\nLyrically, \"Tonight, Tonight\" hangs together with the rest of the Mellon Collie. The lyrics of the song have been compared to Robert Herrick's poem \"To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time\".\n\"Tonight, Tonight\" was met with critical acclaim. Allmusic reviewer Amy Hanson stated that the song \"packs an emotional punch\". Jim Alexander of NME regarded the song as \"swirling [and] grand\". Music Week rated it four out of five, adding, \"A powerful vocals-led single with ferocious driving guitars. Their most commercial release to date which should gain a high chart placing.\" Time's reviewer Christopher John Farley called the song \"an expansive rock anthem, complete with soaring guitars and a 30-piece string section.\" Entertainment Weekly's reviewer David Browne praised the use of strings in the song, saying that it was \"whipped into a frenzy by hurricane-like strings\". On Mellon Collie's entry in Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, \"Tonight, Tonight\" was praised as \"the Pumpkins at their finest\".\nWhile \"Tonight, Tonight\" never approached the chart success of \"1979\", it was among the most successful singles from Mellon Collie. Its highest position on any national chart was a number two peak on the New Zealand Singles Chart. Its highest position in the United States was at number four on Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks. It also achieved number five on the Modern Rock Tracks and number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at number 21 on the Australian Singles Chart on June 9, 1996. It placed at 50th in a list of best rock songs of all time broadcast by Kerrang! TV.\nThe music video was directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and starred Tom Kenny and Jill Talley, a married couple who were, at the time, cast members on the sketch comedy program Mr. Show with Bob and David and would later gain international fame for their voicework on SpongeBob SquarePants. The original idea for the music video was for a Busby Berkeley-style video, complete with \"people diving into champagne glasses\". The band was set to begin production on the video when they discovered that the Red Hot Chili Peppers had done a similarly styled video for their song \"Aeroplane\", which was almost identical to what they had wanted to do.

It became a popular club hit and live track in Underworld's sets, despite the fact it could not be found on an album. However, it did appear on many compilations, b-sides, and even appeared on a bonus disc for Second Toughest in the Infants (1996). The first promo release of the single was pressed onto pink vinyl, and is highly collectible as it has another non-album track, \"Why, Why, Why\".  Due to this track's obscurity there are many bootlegs of it. The more common release has \"Cowgirl\" on it.

It was recorded for the soundtrack of the film Stardust (2007), and then included on the deluxe edition of their fourth studio album Beautiful World (2006). It was released in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2007 via digital download and as a CD single the following day. The single peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart and went on to become the group's second best selling single, shifting over 1.2 million units and being certified as 2x Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\nThe music video, featuring the band and an orchestra, was filmed at Abbey Road Studios, and is interspersed with excerpts shown from the film Stardust. Take That performed the song at the London 2012 Olympic Games closing ceremony whilst the Olympic Flame was extinguished. The song was submitted for consideration at the 80th Academy Awards for Best Original Song but was not nominated.\n\"Rule the World\" is the first song written by Take That specifically for a film. Matthew Vaughn, the director of Stardust, contacted Take That in the hope of getting them to write a song for the film. After seeing the film the band members agreed to write and perform a song. The band wrote the chorus of the song while they were in Spain. They played the song for Matthew Vaughn who included it in the end credits of the film. Gary Barlow performs lead vocals. The song is not included on the soundtrack for Stardust, nor on the original release of the album Beautiful World.\nIt was released internationally exclusively as a single in October 2007, and was premiered live by the band at the inaugural National Movie Awards on 28 September 2007 to rave reviews and critical acclaim. It ended 2007 as the year's 5th biggest-selling single in the UK, despite being released just two months from the end of the year. The song was also the 44th best selling single in the UK of 2008, the following year, and the 16th best selling single in Ireland in 2007.\nThe full-length version appears exclusively on the Tour Souvenir Edition of the album Beautiful World.\nCrossover singer Camilla Kerslake, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Gary Barlow, has recorded the song on her eponymous debut album as \"Il Mondo \u00e8 Nostro\" (\"The World Is Ours\").\nIn October 2007, \"Rule the World\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number 46 and peaked at number 2, being held off the top spot by Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\". The song became the 5th biggest selling single of 2007 and remained in the Top 100 until 12 April 2009, 1 year, 5 months and 21 days after the single's release. On 21 September 2008, the song managed to climb back up to number 34 on the UK Singles Chart following a performance by contestants on BBC One's Last Choir Standing and on 30 November 2008 it managed to climb up the chart once again to number 27 following its appearance on The X Factor, sung by Rachel Hylton.\nThe song spent twelve weeks inside the UK top ten, the longest of any Take That song. It re-entered the chart again in November 2009 following another X Factor performance, this time by Stacey Solomon, and again in November 2010, and has spent 75 weeks on the official UK Top 75 chart, making it the 5th longest runner of all time, and 100 weeks on the Top 100. It was the 30th biggest-selling single of the 2000s in the UK. As of March 2017 it has sold 1.06 million copies in the UK, making it the group's second best selling single in the country, behind \"Back For Good\".\nDigital Spy praised the song, stating it is \"a big, proper, important-sounding ballad \u2013 the piano chords tremor with passion, the strings sweep impressively and every strum of the guitar seems to quiver with emotion \u2013 it offers copious proof that Gary Barlow's flair for melody is still very much intact.\"\nThe music video was directed by Barney Clay and filmed at Abbey Road Studios. It shows the band and the orchestra at the studios performing the song. Another version of the video features excerpts shown from the movie Stardust. It premiered on ITV on 22 September 2007.\nThe song was the finale to The Circus Tour in 2009. This song was also performed on 19 November 2009 for Children in Need on \"Children in Need Rocks the Royal Albert Hall\", where Gary Barlow dedicated it to his father, who had died 5 weeks earlier. Take That performed the song at the London 2012 Olympic Games Closing Ceremony whilst the Olympic Flame was extinguished. The band's performance of the song during the closing ceremony was lauded as inspirational, in light of the loss of Barlow's"

The film producers chose Cornell because they wanted a strong male singer. Cornell and Arnold tried to make the song a replacement theme for the character instead of the \"James Bond theme\" reflecting the agent's inexperience in Casino Royale, as well as an introduction to Daniel Craig's grittier and more emotional portrayal of Bond.\nThe track was leaked onto the Internet on September 20, 2006, and later released as an official single on November 13, 2006 through Interscope Records. It charted in many countries, notably peaking at No. 7 on the UK singles chart. It sold 148,000 copies in 2006 in the UK, and has sold 323,000 digital copies and garnered 3.5 million streams in the U.S. as of 2017. Reviews of the song were positive; it won the Satellite Award and the World Soundtrack Award, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. It was not included in the Casino Royale soundtrack, but appeared on Cornell's second solo album, Carry On.\nLia Vollack, Sony Pictures's President of Music, called Chris Cornell inviting him to make a song for the new Bond movie, which would \"reflect the dramatic new direction of James Bond\", with a \"strong male singer\". Cornell thought it was a strange offer, considering that he was American, and assumed he would perform a secondary song instead of the main theme. Cornell declared he liked the Bond movies, particularly the ones with Sean Connery, but that he \"wasn't really a big fan of the last several movies\". But Daniel Craig's casting as James Bond intrigued him, and he decided to accept. He then went to Prague to visit the film's shooting location, and was impressed with its emotional content when he was shown a rough cut. In Prague he also met the film's composer, David Arnold, who suggested writing a song \"that echoed the film score\".\nThe composers started their writing separately, Cornell in his apartment in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell said, \"It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of wandered around for about a month not thinking about it too much, until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier.\" Later the two musicians met to share their ideas, and according to Arnold \"it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song.\" Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and \"having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape\".\nAfter a demo of the song was approved by the film's producers, both musicians recorded the full version in AIR Studios London. Cornell and Arnold recorded the guitar and bass parts themselves and hired a session musician for the drums. They were finished by the time Casino Royale wrapped its principal photography on July 21, 2006, and Arnold played it at the wrap party. Afterwards he mixed in the orchestral parts.\nSpeaking to the film music fan site Maintitles, Arnold said he wanted \"You Know My Name\" to be a substitute for the James Bond theme, to represent Bond's immaturity. The song's motif is heard throughout the film, and the classic theme plays only during the end credits to signal the end of his character arc. Arnold felt the song should tie closer to the score, and have the \"DNA of the James Bond music\". The musical arrangement tried to create \"the right blend of rock aggression and sophisticated instrumentation\", with Cornell describing it as \"more up-tempo and a little more aggressive than any other Bond theme has been, maybe since Paul McCartney's 'Live and Let Die'.\"\nCornell stated that the biggest two influences on \"You Know My Name\" were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed"

It was commissioned for the soundtrack of the 2013 film The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, where it was played over the closing credits. The Hobbit director, Peter Jackson, asked Sheeran to write a song for the movie after Jackson's daughter, Katie, suggested Sheeran. Sheeran saw the film, wrote the song, and recorded most of the track elements on the same day.\nThe song was released as a digital download on 5 November 2013. Its music video was released the same day. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 13 and reached number one in New Zealand on its sixth week, Sheeran's first number-one single there. \"I See Fire\" was nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Original Song.\n\"I See Fire\" plays over the first section of the closing credits of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, an epic fantasy adventure film directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson. Released on 13 December 2013, it is the second installment in the three-part film series based on the novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien. The Hobbit follows the quest of a home-loving hobbit, a fictional, diminutive humanoid, to win a share of the treasure guarded by the dragon, Smaug.\nSheeran has a lifelong devotion to the novel of Tolkien. His grandfather owns a first edition copy. It was the first book Sheeran's father read to him as a child, and the first book that he read himself. On 5 November 2013, Sheeran announced his involvement in the soundtrack in a series of online posts, which included his thanking Jackson for the opportunity. He is also a fan of Jackson's films.\nJackson was introduced to Sheeran's music by his daughter, Katie, who attended Sheeran's concert in Wellington, New Zealand, in March 2013. Jackson, having learned Sheeran's regard toward his films, met him over lunch the following day where they exchanged email addresses.\nIn late 2013, Jackson and Fran Walsh, who co-produced and co-wrote the film, were searching for an artist who would write and record the song. Following Katie's advice, they decided to tap Sheeran. Jackson sent a message to Sheeran, who was in the Mediterranean island of Ibiza attending a wedding ceremony, asking if he would be interested in the project, which Sheeran accepted. Departing from London, Sheeran and his manager, Stuart, arrived in Wellington within 48 hours.\nSheeran watched the film at an early screening in Park Road Post, a film post-production facility located in Wellington, New Zealand. Jackson advised Sheeran to focus on the film's ending: \"Focus on the last 10 minutes. That's what the song needs to reflect[. ...] Write a song that takes the audience by the hand and leads them from Middle-earth back into reality.\" Capturing his reaction to watching the film, Sheeran immediately began writing the lyrics \"from the perspective of being a dwarf\". Jackson required a folk song and Sheeran, who is \"known for songs that wouldn't fit in a Hobbit film\", attempted to follow in that direction.\nSheeran wrote and recorded, in only one day, most of the elements present in the released version. Further revisions were made in a course of three days that Sheeran stayed in the facility. Sheeran revealed he was given complete freedom in the creative process, while receiving ready inputs from Jackson and his co-filmmakers. In particular, Sheeran notes: \"[Jackson] knows the colors and templates of what the song should be rather than how the melody should go.\"\nSheeran also produced the song, playing all the instruments except for the cello. Despite having never played the violin, he chose to perform it himself through overdubbing. Flight of the Conchords' touring cellist Nigel Collins added cello parts as dictated by Sheeran. Pete Cobbin of Abbey Road Studios mixed \"I See Fire\"; Cobbin was at Park Road Post at the same time, responsible for mixing the musical score of The Desolation of Smaug.\n\"I See Fire\" is a folk ballad, characterized with gently strummed acoustic guitar. Sheeran revealed he took inspiration from the 1970s Irish folk band Planxty. According to Entertainment Weekly's Jodi Walker, the song is \"touch reminiscent\" of \"The Parting Glass\", an Irish traditional song that is a bonus track in Sheeran's debut album, +. The themes in The Hobbit are present in the song's lyrics, which refer to \"fire, mountains and brotherhood\".\n\"I See Fire\" was released on 5 November 2013 through iTunes, initially in the United States and then worldwide within the next 36 hours. It was later released on 10 December 2013 as part of"

The Coldplay single underscores the stature of recording artists we've assembled for this powerful soundtrack,\" added Tracy McKnight, Lionsgate's Head of Film Music.\nThe song was written by all band members and produced by Rik Simpson (with whom the band has previously worked on the Grammy Award-winning album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and Mylo Xyloto), Daniel Green (Mylo Xyloto) and Coldplay themselves.\nThe song is a down-tempo ballad, featuring a delicate piano refrain with a \"moody, haunting melody\", and showcasing Martin's lower-register vocals. According to some reviewers, it sounds \"less like more recent Coldplay tracks and more like a throwback to their sound on A Rush of Blood to the Head,\" and \"like a tossed-off remnant from the outfit's early days, before it began experimenting with deep rhythms and vivid textures.\" The piano builds to a bolder, \"anthemic-quality\" chorus with richly layered production, reminiscent of the band's fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto.\nCatching Fire's major themes informed the song lyrics, with multiple references to recurring elements of the story as well as to mythology and spirituality. According to Billboard magazine, \"the lyrics abstractly touch upon main characters Katniss and Peeta's mutual reliance.\"\nUpon release, \"Atlas\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Michael Nelson of Stereogum called the track \"a swooning, appropriately cinematic ballad.\" Erin Coulehan of Rolling Stone magazine wrote, \"The dreamy tune features a classic Coldplay presentation, with twinkling piano that builds as Chris Martin croons 'I'll carry your world'.\" \"The dreamy, piano-driven track was clearly written specifically for 'Catching Fire,\u2019 with lyrics like \"some bend the bow\" \u2014 about bow-and-arrow-wielding heroine Katniss, presumably \u2013 and \"caught in the fire\" (pretty self-explanatory),\" wrote Karen Lanza of PopCrush.\nUpon release of the soundtrack album, Consequence of Sound's Rob Hakimian called the song \"spirited\", and AllMusic's Heather Phares described it as \"typically sweeping and earnest\". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Coldplay is here too, but in a battle with Lorde's"

It was released on 22 January 2007 as the fifth and final single from the album. The song peaked at No. 23 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's first single to miss the top 20.\nA track titled \"The Night Sky\" was believed to be the obvious choice for a B-side as it was an unreleased track on Under the Iron Sea, mentioned several times and thought to have a relation with the song, but Keane instead included for the first time both cover songs (\"She Sells Sanctuary\" by The Cult and \"Enjoy the Silence\" by Depeche Mode) and a remix of the single by the noted hardcore artist Luna-C in the commercial release. \"The Night Sky\" was instead released as the next single.\nCatalogue number: 1723057\n\"A Bad Dream\"\n\"She Sells Sanctuary\"\n\"A Bad Dream\" (Luna-C Hardcore Remix)\n\"A Bad Dream\" live in Berlin (video)\nCatalogue: 1723058\n\"A Bad Dream\"\n\"She Sells Sanctuary\"\n\"A Bad Dream\"\n\"A Bad Dream\" (video)\n\"Enjoy the Silence\" (Depeche Mode cover)\n\"A Bad Dream\" (Luna-C Bangin' Remix)\nCompetition to see the band at Wembley\nIt was partially based on the \"An Irish Airman Foresees His Death\" poem by W.B. Yeats. Rice-Oxley explained on a podcast:\nWe wanted to get a balance between a kinda dream sequence. It starts very quietly, and I love the idea of being in a plane, like a Spitfire or something, being so high up in the sky that you can't hear the guns below you and so on. And it's almost got a serene silence which is what this Yeats poem seemed to really express. The song starts very quietly, but it gets huge and angry as it goes on... The big distorted washy piano sound in the middle is a pretty vast sound and it's I guess an attempt to express all that anger bursting out.\nIt was composed by Tim Rice-Oxley and Tom Chaplin. It was recorded at the Heliocentric Studios, Rye, East Sussex and at The Magic Shop, New York\n\nThis song is a cover of the Cult's original song. It's the first song released since June 2001 (\"She Has No Time\") that includes acoustic guitar on the recording.\nThe song includes a hardcore style instrumentation never heard on a Keane release before.\nThe music video for \"A Bad Dream\" was shot on 22 November 2006 and premiered a month later. The essentially simple promo features singer Tom Chaplin inside a totally black room. Then a white stripe of light can be seen getting bigger and bigger until the point of the room being completely white. Later on, a black stripe can be seen again getting bigger and bigger until the whole room is black again.\nAn alternate version released on Yahoo Launch UK features short clips of Tim Rice-Oxley and Richard Hughes intercut into the original, looking at Chaplin with melancholic faces.\n\n\"Nederlandse Top 40 \u2013 Keane\" (in Dutch).

It became their third consecutive top-10 hit on the UK Singles Chart, after \"Somewhere Only We Know\" and \"Everybody's Changing\", peaking at number 10. The song also reached the top 20 in Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\"Bedshaped\" was composed sometime in 2001 by Tim Rice-Oxley. It was originally released as a B-side on the Fierce Panda release of \"Everybody's Changing\" in May 2003. James Sanger is credited on this song as the fourth composer.\nRice-Oxley posted an explanation of the song on the official messageboard:\n[The song] is about feeling that you've been \"left behind\" by an old friend or lover, and about hoping that you'll be reunited one day so that you can live out the end of your lives together the way you started them (...) a hope that they'll eventually want to get away from the bright lights and come back home. it's a sad and angry song, but also full of hope.\nI think I'm right in saying that in hospital when someone is ill and has to spend a lot of time in bed they can become 'bedshaped'. It sounds a bit depressing (...) but in the context of the song I wanted to suggest old age and frailty(...)\nThe song is written in the key of E major, with a tempo of 76bpm. After a mysterious intro, a honky tonk-reminiscent piano completes the main riff, with an Emaj chord. The vocals are introduced 59 seconds in. After the second chorus, a small piano-riff gives place to the song's instrumental bridge which featured gothic voices, ending with an instrumental chorus with guitar alike sounds, produced by Rice-Oxley's Yamaha CX7 (these are sung by Chaplin during some live performances) to fade with Chaplin singing \"But what do I know?, what do I know? I know\".\nThe video for the song is available on the enhanced CD single version, as well as the Bonus DVD edition of Hopes and Fears and on Strangers.  The video is directed by Corin Hardy, and based on his 2003 stop-motion animated short film \"Butterfly\". The video shows a bedraggled, naked man amongst some refuse, drowning his sorrows in alcohol. He is lonely and sad, and crawls into a bathroom where he hides, and writes some of the song's lyrics such as 'don't laugh at me' and \"don't look away\" on the walls, like graffiti. A cat drags some ill-fitting clothes into the room for him, where he dresses and dares to venture outside. He exits and sees people gathered in a restaurant. He hallucinates and their faces turn into gremlin-like monsters, causing him to run back to the bathroom in fear, only for the walls to collapse and drown him in white light. The wizened man finds himself against a white background, where he witnesses animated versions of Keane's band members playing the titular song with the lyrics he wrote on the walls. Having seemingly found solace in this unusual scene, the man, along with Keane, fades into the light.\nThe band appear throughout as animation within the background of the main action, and as drawings towards the end of the video. To achieve this, Hardy's friend David Lupton was recruited to hand-draw 500 pictures of the band in the space of a week.\nThe music video was produced by Kit Hawkins and Adam Tudhope for White House Pictures.\nCD CID870\n\"Bedshaped\" \u2013 4:37\n\"Something in Me Was Dying\" \u2013 4:46\n\"Untitled 2\" \u2013 3:02\n\"Bedshaped\" (Video) \u2013 4:41\nUK, 7-inch vinyl IS849\n\"Bedshaped\"\n\"Something in Me Was Dying\"\n\nAll live tracks recorded at BNN\nCD1\n\nReleased 15 October 2004\n\"Bedshaped\" \u2013 4:37\n\"Something in Me Was Dying\" \u2013 4:47\n\"Everybody's Changing\" (live) \u2013 3:35\n\"Can't Stop Now\" (live) \u2013 3:41\nCD2\n\nReleased 19 October 2004\n\"Bedshaped\" \u2013 4:37\n\"Untitled 2\" \u2013 3:01\n\"Somewhere Only We Know\" (live) \u2013 3:32\n\"Bend and Break\" (live) \u2013 3:36\n\"Bedshaped\" (video) \u2013 4:41\nCD3\n\nReleased 12 November 2004\n\"Bedshaped\" \u2013 4:38\n\"This Is the Last Time\" (live) \u2013 3:27\n\"We Might as Well Be Strangers\" (live) \u2013 3:10\n\"Bedshaped\" (live) \u2013 4:08\n\"Bedshaped\" (live video) \u2013 4:47\nReleased 18 April 2005\nCD1\n\"Bedshaped\"\n\"This Is the Last Time\"\n\"Untitled 2\"\n\"Everybody's Changing\" (live) (Airwaves Festival, Reykjav\u00edk, 23 October 2004)\n\"Somewhere Only We Know\" (live) (Forum, London, 10 May 2004)\nCD2\n\"Bedshaped\"\n\"Something in Me Was Dying\"\n\"This Is the Last Time\" (live acoustic) (Mill St. Brewery, Toronto, 20 September 2004)\n\"Bedshaped\" (live) (Brixton Academy, London, 17 November 2004)\n\"We Might as Well Be Strangers\" (live) (Columbiafritz,"

The song was released on 21 August 2006 as the third single from the album. \"Crystal Ball\" peaked at number 20 on both the Dutch Singles Chart and the UK Singles Chart.\n\"Crystal Ball\" was composed by Tim Rice-Oxley in 2006. It was recorded at the Helioscentric Studios, East Sussex and at the Magic Shop, New York City. Guitar effects are created by a distorted Yamaha CP70.\nOur touring schedule over the last couple of years meant that we were on the road all the time, and were never kinda stopping to really appreciate what was going and just spend time having fun - just the three of us functioning as friends and as people, like you normally do. And I think we all started to recede slightly into this little world where we weren't really communicating or really expressing anything, and we weren't really feeling anything. And it kind of came to a head when we were in America in June last year and I remember sitting on the bus, and I was trying to write a song and I realized that I didn't have anything to say at all, and I didn't have any feelings about anything - good feelings or bad feelings. That was a really scary for me, because I've always had lots to say, and lots of opinions whether right or wrong. We then ended up having a massive row about something a couple of days later and it came out of that that we were all feeling this sense of numbness, this feeling of kinda fading away as people. And I just tried to write about that, and it ended up becoming Crystal Ball. - Tim Rice-Oxley at Keaneshaped\nSimilarly to other Keane songs such as \"Somewhere Only We Know\", the song follows a quaver-note driven sound. Several effects, like the aforementioned distortion piano and strings, are added through the song. \nThe fading-in intro is often referred as a continuation to \"The Iron Sea\", and represented as an immediate returning to surface of the \"Iron Sea\". Vocals are introduced at 19 seconds and continue until fading on 3:04. The demo version included on the bonus DVD of the album would reprise the intro riff before the finale.\n\nIt was recorded at the Magic Shop Studios in New York City. It was first known by a shot on the Under the Iron Sea DVD, as well as in the June issue of Q Magazine. It is rumoured amongst the band's fanbase that this song may have been composed by Chaplin as a response to Rice-Oxley's \"Hamburg Song\" and \"Broken Toy\". In May 2015, Chaplin tweeted that it was Rice-Oxley that wrote the song.\nThis version, recorded at The Magic Shop, New York City, features drums that were not present in the album version. The recording is also extended and features an immediate intro.\nThe music video for \"Crystal Ball\" was released by NME on 4 August 2006 and features the American actor Giovanni Ribisi. The director was Giuseppe Capotondi. It is about an estate agent losing his identity.\nA woman is helping her husband and young son get ready to leave the house. He then gets into his car and drives off with his son. The man gets to his office and warmly interacts with a secretary. He shows off a house to a couple, implying that he is a real estate agent, and working in the office.\nWhen the real estate agent returns to his house, he finds a red car parked outside. His keys do not work, so he knocks on the door and rings the bell. His wife partially opens the door and looks surprised. A man appears behind the wife and the agent speaks with a look of disbelief and the wife shuts the door. The agent looks in house and frightens the son.  The agent explains the situation to a police officer as the man and his wife talk to another officer. The agent is ushered away and drives away in his car.\nAfter making phone calls and wandering around, the man wakes up in his car in the parking lot of his office. He walks into the office and finds the man sitting at his desk. He begins to argue with him and stops when he sees that the photographs on his desk now show the other man with his family. When the man is thrown out of the building, someone runs toward his car. He runs to the car claiming that the car belongs to him, but the person drives the car away, leaving the man confused and defeated. The story is intercut with footage of the band playing together in a room.\nThe video was also recycled for the US release video for the single \"Nothing in My Way\", albeit with"

The song was later released as the B-side of the US single \"Nowhere Man\", and then as the tenth track on the North America-only album Yesterday and Today. It is the only song by the band credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney\u2013Starkey and the only song on Rubber Soul that features Ringo Starr on lead vocals. The song reached number 81 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1966.\nJohn Lennon wrote the song in early 1959, likely at 251 Menlove Avenue. The early version of the song is heavily inspired by Buddy Holly and differed substantially from the Rubber Soul version with only the chorus being the same.\nThe Beatles nearly recorded the song in March 1963, but ultimately did not record the song until November 1965 for Rubber Soul. According to Lennon, \"it was resurrected with a middle eight thrown in, probably with Paul [McCartney]'s help\". Barry Miles also claimed that McCartney and Starr combined for the middle eight. There is no formal middle eight in the song, though one chorus and one verse are extended; Musicologist and writer Ian MacDonald believes those longer sections were written by McCartney. Starr contributed to the lyrics, his first-ever composing credit on a Beatles song. When asked what his contribution was, Starr jokingly responded, \"[I wrote] about five words to 'What Goes On' and I haven't done a thing since.\" MacDonald and musicologist Walter Everett write that Starr's contribution was the lyric \"Waiting for the tides of time\". MacDonald calls these lines, \"pseudo-Dylanesque\". The first pressing of the single accidentally omitted \"Starkey\" in the songwriting credit.\n\nOn 5 March 1963, during a session for \"From Me To You\" and \"Thank You Girl\", the Beatles wanted to record \"What Goes On\" and \"One After 909\" (then titled \"The One After 909\"). With only enough time remaining to record one more song, they opted for \"The One After 909\". Lennon and Paul McCartney recorded a demo of this version in 1963, but the song was not used until 1965 as Ringo Starr's vocal piece for Rubber Soul.\nNeil Aspinall recalls that McCartney made a multitrack home demo of the song in 1965: \"When Paul wanted to show Ringo how 'What Goes On' sounded he made up a multi-track tape. Onto this went Paul singing, Paul playing lead guitar, Paul playing bass and Paul playing drums. Then Ringo listened to the finished tape and added his own ideas before the recording session.\"\nThe Rubber Soul version was recorded in one take, with overdubs, during a late-night session on 4 November 1965. George Martin produced, supported by engineers Norman Smith, Ken Scott and Graham Platt. Everett writes that Lennon's guitar part is in the style of Steve Cropper and his \"Memphis 'chick' rhythm part.\" He adds that George Harrison includes \"rockabilly string crossings, double-stops, and portamento neighbors.\" Starr likely recorded a guide vocal on the basic track, wiped over by his final vocal overdub. The original guide vocal can be heard through the drum mike during Starr's solo and during the coda. As well, during the verse before the lead break after Starr sings \"tell me why,\" Lennon says, \"We already told you why!\", in reference to the Beatles' \"Tell Me Why\" from A Hard Day's Night.\nMartin, assisted by Smith and Jerry Boys, mixed the song for mono and stereo on 9 November 1965.  Harrison's Gretsch Tennessean guitar is muted during the last two bars of the mono mix. Everett suggests this likely happened because the engineer meant to mute the vocal track but forgot that Harrison's guitar was on that track as well.\nThe Beatles released \"What Goes On\" in both mono and stereo in the U.K. on the 3 December 1965 release Rubber Soul. Capitol released the song as the B-side to the U.S. only single \"Nowhere Man\" on 21 February 1966. Despite being the B-side, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, reaching #81. Capitol pulled the track from the North American release of Rubber Soul and instead included it on the North American only album Yesterday and Today, released 20 June 1966. \nCritics have generally been unfavourable towards the song when comparing it with the others on Rubber Soul. Beatles writer Kenneth Womack asserts that the song is \"quite arguably the weakest and most incongruous track on the album.\" Professor of English and writer"

It became their third consecutive top-10 hit on the UK Singles Chart, after \"Somewhere Only We Know\" and \"Everybody's Changing\", peaking at number 10. The song also reached the top 20 in Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\"Bedshaped\" was composed sometime in 2001 by Tim Rice-Oxley. It was originally released as a B-side on the Fierce Panda release of \"Everybody's Changing\" in May 2003. James Sanger is credited on this song as the fourth composer.\nRice-Oxley posted an explanation of the song on the official messageboard:\n[The song] is about feeling that you've been \"left behind\" by an old friend or lover, and about hoping that you'll be reunited one day so that you can live out the end of your lives together the way you started them (...) a hope that they'll eventually want to get away from the bright lights and come back home. it's a sad and angry song, but also full of hope.\nI think I'm right in saying that in hospital when someone is ill and has to spend a lot of time in bed they can become 'bedshaped'. It sounds a bit depressing (...) but in the context of the song I wanted to suggest old age and frailty(...)\nThe song is written in the key of E major, with a tempo of 76bpm. After a mysterious intro, a honky tonk-reminiscent piano completes the main riff, with an Emaj chord. The vocals are introduced 59 seconds in. After the second chorus, a small piano-riff gives place to the song's instrumental bridge which featured gothic voices, ending with an instrumental chorus with guitar alike sounds, produced by Rice-Oxley's Yamaha CX7 (these are sung by Chaplin during some live performances) to fade with Chaplin singing \"But what do I know?, what do I know? I know\".\nThe video for the song is available on the enhanced CD single version, as well as the Bonus DVD edition of Hopes and Fears and on Strangers.  The video is directed by Corin Hardy, and based on his 2003 stop-motion animated short film \"Butterfly\". The video shows a bedraggled, naked man amongst some refuse, drowning his sorrows in alcohol. He is lonely and sad, and crawls into a bathroom where he hides, and writes some of the song's lyrics such as 'don't laugh at me' and \"don't look away\" on the walls, like graffiti. A cat drags some ill-fitting clothes into the room for him, where he dresses and dares to venture outside. He exits and sees people gathered in a restaurant. He hallucinates and their faces turn into gremlin-like monsters, causing him to run back to the bathroom in fear, only for the walls to collapse and drown him in white light. The wizened man finds himself against a white background, where he witnesses animated versions of Keane's band members playing the titular song with the lyrics he wrote on the walls. Having seemingly found solace in this unusual scene, the man, along with Keane, fades into the light.\nThe band appear throughout as animation within the background of the main action, and as drawings towards the end of the video. To achieve this, Hardy's friend David Lupton was recruited to hand-draw 500 pictures of the band in the space of a week.\nThe music video was produced by Kit Hawkins and Adam Tudhope for White House Pictures.\nCD CID870\n\"Bedshaped\" \u2013 4:37\n\"Something in Me Was Dying\" \u2013 4:46\n\"Untitled 2\" \u2013 3:02\n\"Bedshaped\" (Video) \u2013 4:41\nUK, 7-inch vinyl IS849\n\"Bedshaped\"\n\"Something in Me Was Dying\"\n\nAll live tracks recorded at BNN\nCD1\n\nReleased 15 October 2004\n\"Bedshaped\" \u2013 4:37\n\"Something in Me Was Dying\" \u2013 4:47\n\"Everybody's Changing\" (live) \u2013 3:35\n\"Can't Stop Now\" (live) \u2013 3:41\nCD2\n\nReleased 19 October 2004\n\"Bedshaped\" \u2013 4:37\n\"Untitled 2\" \u2013 3:01\n\"Somewhere Only We Know\" (live) \u2013 3:32\n\"Bend and Break\" (live) \u2013 3:36\n\"Bedshaped\" (video) \u2013 4:41\nCD3\n\nReleased 12 November 2004\n\"Bedshaped\" \u2013 4:38\n\"This Is the Last Time\" (live) \u2013 3:27\n\"We Might as Well Be Strangers\" (live) \u2013 3:10\n\"Bedshaped\" (live) \u2013 4:08\n\"Bedshaped\" (live video) \u2013 4:47\nReleased 18 April 2005\nCD1\n\"Bedshaped\"\n\"This Is the Last Time\"\n\"Untitled 2\"\n\"Everybody's Changing\" (live) (Airwaves Festival, Reykjav\u00edk, 23 October 2004)\n\"Somewhere Only We Know\" (live) (Forum, London, 10 May 2004)\nCD2\n\"Bedshaped\"\n\"Something in Me Was Dying\"\n\"This Is the Last Time\" (live acoustic) (Mill St. Brewery, Toronto, 20 September 2004)\n\"Bedshaped\" (live) (Brixton Academy, London, 17 November 2004)\n\"We Might as Well Be Strangers\" (live) (Columbiafritz,"

It was written and produced by The Matrix (a production team consisting of Lauren Christy, Scott Spock and Graham Edwards), with additional writing from Charlie Midnight. The song is influenced by pop rock music, and the lyrics chronicle the protagonist getting over a breakup with her boyfriend, declaring him as \"so yesterday\". The song received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, with some of them noting its close similarity to Avril Lavigne's works, while others named it one of Duff's best songs ever.\n\"So Yesterday\" premiered on AOL Music's \"First Listen\" on June 27, 2003. It was serviced to mainstream radio in the United States on July 14, 2003. The song became Duff's first single to chart in the US Billboard Hot 100 where it reached number forty-two. It was more successful outside the US, reaching the top forty in most countries it charted, peaking at number two in Canada, number eight in Australia and France, and number nine in the United Kingdom; in Australia the song was certified Platinum.\nThe song was accompanied by a music video, directed by Chris Applebaum, which showed Duff playing a prank on her ex-boyfriend. It was successful on various music video channels like MTV and MuchMusic. Duff performed the song on her Metamorphosis Tour and has since performed it on all her concert tours. The song is also featured on the compilations Most Wanted (2005), 4Ever Hilary (2006) and Best of Hilary Duff (2008), and the music video game Band Hero.\nAlthough Duff recorded songs like \"I Can't Wait\", \"Why Not\" and \"What Dreams Are Made Of\", which received substantial airplay on Radio Disney, executives at Buena Vista Music Group, Duff's record label, planned to help her reach a more mature audience. So, Andre Recke, an executive at Buena Vista, along with Duff and her mother, enlisted the songwriting and production team \"The Matrix\" (consisting of Lauren Christy, Scott Spock and Graham Edwards) to produce songs for Duff's debut album Metamorphosis (2003). \"So Yesterday\" became one of three songs produced by the team for the album, and was the last song recorded for the album. Duff herself has said that when she first heard the song, she did not really like it; however, her opinion changed after she listened to it more often. She then decided she would give the song a \"100 percent\" and not comment negatively of it. According to her, she \"ended up loving it\", stating, \"It was such a fun song, and it means a lot.\" Bob Cavallo, chairman of Buena Vista Records, said that the song was \"more mature than the past work that she's done.\"\n\"So Yesterday\" premiered on AOL Music's \"First Listen\" on June 27, 2003, and it drew over 500,000 streams in two days. It was released to mainstream radio in the United States on July 15, and was the \"most added\" song on the format in its first two weeks of release. The song is featured on all of Duff's compilations album, including Most Wanted (2005), 4ever (2006) and her greatest hits album, Best of Hilary Duff (2008). It is also featured on the music video game Band Hero as a bonus download.\nLyrically, the song talks about someone who has got over a broken relationship, declaring the partner as \"so yesterday\". According to Duff, the song's lyrics are very empowering towards breaking up with someone and getting over it. In a 2006 interview with Instinct, Duff said that people often told her that \"So Yesterday\" was \"the ultimate post-breakup anthem\". She said her mother instilled the notion of inner strength in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive. \"I don't think there's very much of that out there anymore.\", she said. She stressed the importance of strong songs that are not all about how \"a boy broke your heart and you're never going to get on your feet again\", saying it was good for girls to hear.\nMusically, \"So Yesterday\" is moderately paced, with influences of pop and rock music and moves at a tempo of 76 bpm. The song is set in the signature of common time, and is written in the key of C major. The song has the sequence of Am\u2013G\u2013Fmaj7 as its chord progression. Duff's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the note of A4.\nUpon its release, the song received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Stephen"

Its bridge has a beat comparable to English rock band Queen's single, \"We Will Rock You\". Lyrically, the song express a message of empowerment after the end of a relationship.\n\nJessica Sager from PopCrush gave the song 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising the group's vocals as having \"a hefty dose of soul that many of their Top 40 contemporaries, most of whom are a lot older than they are, lack.\" Christina Lee, from Idolator called the song \"explosive\". Lee also noted the equal distribution in vocals, saying the group \"exchanged the vocals in a way that each member is heard, but in subtle and unexpected ways\".\nIn a positive review, Jenna Rubenstein wrote on the MTV blog that \"we effing loving it\" and also complimented the single's \"shiny, polished pop beat\" and lyrics. Examiner and Billboard named the single a \"pop kiss-off anthem\", with Billboard writing that the \"empowering track fulfills the group's promise of \"fun pop\".

The Portuguese website Original Tune praised the song for \"undoubtedly\" making the \"most complete of an artist revealed by X-Factor US\".

It was released and serviced to contemporary hit radio on September 27, 2016, through Epic Records and Syco Music as the third and final single from the group's second studio album, 7/27 (2016) as the opening track. The song was written by Tinashe Kachingwe, Alexander Kronlund, and Lukas Loules, with production handled by Kronlund and Loules. \"That's My Girl\" is mainly an R&B anthemic track with elements of electro-pop and lyrical themes focused on female empowerment, encouragement and feminist influences. Several critics noted similarities from the group's previous singles, which also feature an indistinguishable militaristic production.\n\"That's My Girl\" was serviced to contemporary hit radio in the United States on September 27, 2016, the same day as its release. Prior to that, the track received airplay a month before, on Radio Disney. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at its peak position of 73 and stayed on the charts for two consecutive weeks.

Internationally, \"That's My Girl\" placed in the top twenty in Scotland, while charting in the top forty in countries such as Hungary, the United Kingdom and Belgium. The song earned a gold certification in the United States and a silver certification in the United Kingdom.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Hannah Lux Davis and released on September 19, 2016. The dystopian clip follows the group around an apocalyptic setting where they perform choreographed dance routines and save people trapped around a village dressed in white-colored outfits, inspired by the film Mad Max. The group performed the track on national television for the first time at the 2016 American Music Awards. It received promotion in commercials for the 2016 Summer Olympics, which featured the United States Gymnastics team. A remixes extended play was released two months after its initial release. It is also the group's last single as a quintet featuring member Camila Cabello, as she announced her departure from the group in December 2016 to pursue a solo career.\n\"That's My Girl\" was co-written by singer Tinashe, Alexander Kronlund, and Lukas Loules, who also handled the production with Kronlund. The song was written by Tinashe during an opening show for Katy Perry's Prismatic World Tour. The song was originally titled \"She's My Girl\" and was cited by Lauren Jauregui during an interview with Spin. \"That's My Girl\" was recorded by Sam Holland at MXM Studios and Windmark Studios, both located on state of California, and mixed at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The horn arrangement was provided by Kronlund and Jonas Thander who also performed the saxophone, the trombone was played by Magnus Wiklund while the trumpets was performed by Stefan Persson and Karl Olandersson.\n\"That's My Girl\" was described an \"R&B dance banger\"; the song has a length of three minutes and twenty-four seconds. It is in the key of F minor, and written in common time with a moderate tempo of 101\u00a0beats per minute. Lyrically the song expresses a message of female empowerment. Its instrumentation includes \"brassy horns, heavy bass, and an electronic drumroll\". The song opens with Brooke singing the first verse: \"Who's been working so damn hard?/ You got that head on overload,\" before praising \"that flawless body\", accompanied by horn samples. The pre-chorus is introduced by Jauregui who sings backed by Cabello harmonizing around her voice, \"You've been down before/You've been hurt before/You've got up before/You'll be good to go. good to go.\" Normani then rap-sings in the bridge: \"Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it/Get mad independent, don't you ever forget it.\" Adam R. Holz from website Plugged In Online, described \"That's My Girl\" as an \"empowerment anthem that emphasizes the importance of women working hard, taking charge of their lives and not letting manipulative men define them.\"\n\"That's My Girl\" received positive reviews from music critics, with some noting its horn samples and theme of female empowerment. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Gerrick D. Kennedy called the song a \"horn driven bombast\" and states that it \"delivers a punchy message of female unity\". While reviewing the album 7/27, Christopher R. Weingarten from Rolling Stone wrote that the track did not compare to \"Boss\", the group's first single from Reflection but concludes saying \"\"That's My"

Released in June 1991,  \"Treaty\" was the first song by a predominantly Aboriginal band to chart in Australia and was the first song in any Aboriginal Australian language to gain extensive international recognition, peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play singles charts. The song is in Gumatj, one of the Yolngu Matha dialects and a language of the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land in northern Australia.\nThe song was released three years after the presentation of the Barunga Statement to then-Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Brothers Mandawauy and Galarrwuy Yunupingu wanted to highlight the lack of progress on the treaty between Indigenous Australians and the Australian government.\n\"Treaty\" peaked at No.\u00a011 on the ARIA Singles Chart in September 1991. In May 2001 \"Treaty\" was selected by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. In 2009 \"Treaty\" was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry. In January 2018, as part of Triple M's \"Ozzest 100\", the \"most Australian songs of all time\", the Filthy Lucre version of \"Treaty\" was ranked number 10.\nIn 1988, as part of Bicentennial celebrations,  the Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, visited the Northern Territory for the Barunga Festival, where he was presented with a statement of Aboriginal political objectives by Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Wenten Rubuntja, known as the Barunga Statement. Hawke responded to the Barunga Statement with a promise that a treaty would be concluded with Indigenous Australians by 1990.\nIn 1991, Yothu Yindi were Hughie Benjamin on drums, Sophie Garrkali and Julie Gungunbuy as dancers, Stuart Kellaway on bass guitar, Witiyana Marika on manikay (traditional vocals), bilma (ironwood clapsticks) and dance, Milkayngu Mununggurr on yidaki (didgeridoo), Gurrumul Yunupingu on keyboards, guitar and percussion, Makuma Yunupingu on yidaki, vocals, bilma, Mandawuy Yunupingu on vocals and guitar, Mangatjay Yunupingu as a dancer. Mandawuy Yunupingu, with his older brother Galarrwuy, wanted a song to highlight the lack of progress on the treaty between Aboriginal peoples and the federal government. Mandawuy Yunupingu recalls:\nBob Hawke visited the Territory. He went to this gathering in Barunga. And this is where he made a statement that there shall be a treaty between black and white Australia. Sitting around the camp fire, trying to work out a chord to the guitar, and around that camp fire, I said, \"Well, I heard it on the radio. And I saw it on the television.\" That should be a catchphrase. And that's where 'Treaty' was born.\n\u2014\u2009Mandawuy Yunupingu, 8 July 2004\n\"Treaty\" was written by Australian musician Paul Kelly and Yothu Yindi members Mandawuy Yunupingu, Kellaway, Williams, Gurrumul Yunupingu, Mununggurr and Marika and Peter Garrett. The initial in June 1991 release received limited radio and television exposure (mainly on ABC radio and SBS television).\nAfter the initial release of the song failed to chart, Melbourne-based DJ Gavin Campbell (Razor Records),  approached Mushroom Records to create a dance-oriented remix. The Filthy Lucre production team, consisting of Campbell, Paul Main and Robert Goodge produced a remix without the band's involvement but with the understanding that the Yolngu side of the music would be preserved. The remix not only modified the musical backing but dispensed with the majority of the English language lyrics, with the song sung almost entirely in the Aboriginal language, Gumatj. The Filthy Lucre remix was released in June, entering the charts in July and peaking at No.\u00a011 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) singles charts by September, spending a total of 22 weeks in the national charts.\n\"Treaty\" was the first song by a predominantly Aboriginal band to chart in Australia.\nSuccess for the single was transferred to the related album Tribal Voice which peaked at No.\u00a04 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The album produced by Mark Moffatt for Mushroom Records was released in September 1991. Mandawuy Yunupingu took leave of absence from his duties as principal to tour and promote the single and album. \n\"Treaty\" peaked at No.\u00a011 on the ARIA Singles Chart in September 1991.\nIn May 2001 \"Treaty\" was selected by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of"

It is the fourth track from their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams. It features uncredited guest vocals by Gwyneth Paltrow, who at the time was married to Chris Martin despite their separation being announced in 2014. The track premiered during Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show on 26 November 2015 and was originally released as a promotional single for the album on 27 November 2015.\nOn 11 November 2016, however, the song was released as the fourth official single from the album through a newly recorded stripped-down version, which was inspired by Martin's unrehearsed solo performance of the song at the recent Glastonbury Festival. This recording ends with a sample of Muhammad Ali's 1977 speech in Newcastle upon Tyne. \nThe track revolves around a heartfelt piano riff and was written in the key of C# Minor at 73 BPM and a chord progression that alternates between C#m-A-E-G#m7 and C#m-A-E-B.\nMartin came up with the idea for the title of the song from a slang word he heard from a surfer. In an interview with Zane Lowe, he explained the origin of the phrase: \"I was in the ocean one day with this surfer guy, who spoke just like you'd imagine a surfer guy to speak \u2026 This guy spoke like Sean Penn's character from Fast Times at Ridgemont High. He was like, 'Yo dude, I was doing this thing the other day man, it gave me this total everglow!'\"\nThe song was debuted during the iHeartRadio album release party of A Head Full of Dreams, on 19 November 2015. On June 26, 2016, Coldplay performed at Glastonbury Festival and after introducing the band, Chris Martin announced they were going to play Everglow. Chris' piano was out of tune causing Martin to stop and do the song in a key down, so he played the song with the piano, without the other members of the band. Days later, on July 3, 2016, the band started to play that stripped back version of Everglow, and on November 11, 2016 it was released as the final single of the album because of how much they liked the live performance.\nAn initial video directed by Joe Connor was filmed at the Eisstadion am Pferdeturm in Hanover on 30 June 2016, but was unreleased. This video was leaked online in 2017. Another video filmed by Ben Mor, featuring Chris Martin performing the song on a grand piano, was released on 9 December 2016.\n\nCredits are adapted from A Head Full of Dreams liner notes.\nColdplay\nGuy Berryman \u2013 bass guitar\nJonny Buckland \u2013 guitar\nWill Champion \u2013 drums, drum pad, percussion, backing vocals\nChris Martin \u2013 lead vocals, piano\nAdditional musicians\nMikkel S Eriksen \u2013 additional instruments, production, mixing\nTor Erik Hermansen \u2013 additional instruments, production, mixing\nGwyneth Paltrow \u2013 backing vocals\nDavide Rossi \u2013 strings\nRik Simpson \u2013 additional instruments, backing vocals, mixing\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease as a promotional single.\n\"Hear Coldplay's Heartfelt New Ballad 'Everglow'\".

It was released in early 2002 by Mushroom Records as second single from the album, with the exception of North America, where Interscope issued \"Breaking Up the Girl\" instead. In the years since release, \"Cherry Lips\" has become an enduring track for the band, an alternative rock LGBTQ anthem, and after almost two decades continues to resonate, being used as the home run song of the Milwaukee Brewers and in advertisement campaigns for Microsoft's Surface Go laptop tablets.\n\"Cherry Lips\" faltered in major markets, but was a huge hit in Italy, where it had been the sound of a prominent winter marketing campaign for Breil Stones, reaching #8 on the Italian charts. Like lead single \"Androgyny\", \"Cherry Lips\" was a success in New Zealand and Australia, where it became Garbage's biggest hit single, spending five non-consecutive weeks in the top ten. \"Cherry Lips\" was ultimately certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\nAs the first Garbage single fully released in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the band donated a percentage of the royalties generated from the sales of \"Cherry Lips\" to the International Red Cross.\n\"Cherry Lips\" was written and recorded at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. Written just as Garbage were about to begin mixing their third album, \"Cherry Lips\" was a late inclusion to the album. The song began as a keyboard melody, and was originally known by the working title \"Wonderjam\". While recording the song, Steve Marker played a tuba, and recorded the output of the audio being run through a wah-wah pedal. Daniel Shulman, at the end of his second set of scheduled bass sessions for the album, quickly created a sub-hook bassline for the chorus on a Sabre bass run through an Ampeg B15 amplifier. The band was happy with the bassline and used it on the final mix of \"Cherry Lips\". Manson described \"Cherry Lips\" as \"an adrenaline rush\" and \"probably the most celebratory song we've ever written\".\nShirley Manson wrote the lyrics based loosely around two novels she had just read, Sarah and The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, written by author Laura Albert under the pseudonym of JT LeRoy. \"I took a bit of poetic license, but I wrote it for JT. It's easily the most uplifting thing we've ever done. It sounds nothing like us; it sounds like a Shangri-Las song\", Manson explained. Like the rest of the world, Manson had believed that LeRoy had been a teenage truck-stop hustler who'd escaped the streets to become a writer. Manson exchanged emails with LeRoy over the course of the album sessions. \"I wanted to write an ode to transgender spirit, inspired by my interactions with this peculiar but emotionally generous creature I knew online as JT\", Manson later recalled. On the Beautiful Garbage sleeve notes, Manson dedicated \"Cherry Lips\" to \"The Terminator\", another alias of JT LeRoy.  In 2005, LeRoy was exposed as an invention of Laura Albert in articles published by Stephen Beachy, The New York Times and Vanity Fair. \"I know a lot of people felt conned in the end,\" Manson explained. \"I didn't. I just felt sad that a woman felt she would stand a better chance in the world if she was a man, that JT was 'dead' and wouldn't be part of my life anymore\". Manson still felt that the books \"remain a marvel and whoever wrote them is still a genius whether they are a man, woman or wilderbeast.\"\n\"We were in different headspaces every time we recorded, which is why every song is different,\" Manson later explained, \"\"Silence Is Golden\" is probably the heaviest song we've ever recorded and \"Cherry Lips\" the poppiest. They're juxtaposed right next to each other.\" When Manson recorded her lead vocal, the takes were heavily EQ'd at the tracking stage (\"lt was tracked that way for effect\", explained engineer Billy Bush, \"it sounded weirder that way!\").\nThe first territory to receive a \"Cherry Lips\" commercial release was Japan, where Sony Music Int'l issued a five-track CD maxi of \"Cherry Lips\" remixes on December 27, coinciding with the announcement of Garbage's upcoming tour dates in Tokyo and Osaka. In February 2002, Sony followed up the single by issuing Special Collection, an exclusive extended play collecting together the international b-sides with artwork from the \"Cherry Lips\" music video.\nAcross Europe, PIAS Recordings issued \"Cherry Lips\" on"

It is the fourth track from their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams. It features uncredited guest vocals by Gwyneth Paltrow, who at the time was married to Chris Martin despite their separation being announced in 2014. The track premiered during Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show on 26 November 2015 and was originally released as a promotional single for the album on 27 November 2015.\nOn 11 November 2016, however, the song was released as the fourth official single from the album through a newly recorded stripped-down version, which was inspired by Martin's unrehearsed solo performance of the song at the recent Glastonbury Festival. This recording ends with a sample of Muhammad Ali's 1977 speech in Newcastle upon Tyne. \nThe track revolves around a heartfelt piano riff and was written in the key of C# Minor at 73 BPM and a chord progression that alternates between C#m-A-E-G#m7 and C#m-A-E-B.\nMartin came up with the idea for the title of the song from a slang word he heard from a surfer. In an interview with Zane Lowe, he explained the origin of the phrase: \"I was in the ocean one day with this surfer guy, who spoke just like you'd imagine a surfer guy to speak \u2026 This guy spoke like Sean Penn's character from Fast Times at Ridgemont High. He was like, 'Yo dude, I was doing this thing the other day man, it gave me this total everglow!'\"\nThe song was debuted during the iHeartRadio album release party of A Head Full of Dreams, on 19 November 2015. On June 26, 2016, Coldplay performed at Glastonbury Festival and after introducing the band, Chris Martin announced they were going to play Everglow. Chris' piano was out of tune causing Martin to stop and do the song in a key down, so he played the song with the piano, without the other members of the band. Days later, on July 3, 2016, the band started to play that stripped back version of Everglow, and on November 11, 2016 it was released as the final single of the album because of how much they liked the live performance.\nAn initial video directed by Joe Connor was filmed at the Eisstadion am Pferdeturm in Hanover on 30 June 2016, but was unreleased. This video was leaked online in 2017. Another video filmed by Ben Mor, featuring Chris Martin performing the song on a grand piano, was released on 9 December 2016.\n\nCredits are adapted from A Head Full of Dreams liner notes.\nColdplay\nGuy Berryman \u2013 bass guitar\nJonny Buckland \u2013 guitar\nWill Champion \u2013 drums, drum pad, percussion, backing vocals\nChris Martin \u2013 lead vocals, piano\nAdditional musicians\nMikkel S Eriksen \u2013 additional instruments, production, mixing\nTor Erik Hermansen \u2013 additional instruments, production, mixing\nGwyneth Paltrow \u2013 backing vocals\nDavide Rossi \u2013 strings\nRik Simpson \u2013 additional instruments, backing vocals, mixing\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease as a promotional single.\n\"Hear Coldplay's Heartfelt New Ballad 'Everglow'\".

An exclusive digital EP version of it, with the B-sides \"Major Minus\" and \"Moving to Mars\", came out in the following weeks, being considered the band's eighth extended play. The track contains elements of the 1976 song \"I Go to Rio\" written by Peter Allen and Adrienne Anderson. It debuted at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, selling 85,000 copies in its first week before climbing to its peak of number 14. On the UK Singles Chart, the song peaked at number 6. \nIts radio debut happened on BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC 6 Music, Absolute Radio, and Xfm. Coldplay first performed the song live on 4 June at the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festival in N\u00fcrnberg, Germany. They also played it at the Steve Jobs memorial event at Apple headquarters on 19 October 2011 in Cupertino, California, and at the opening of the MTV European Music Awards in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 6 November 2011.\nThe track was used as the theme for the live-action film adaptation of Ch\u016bya Koyama's Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai (Space Brothers) manga and scored two nominations at the 54th Grammy Awards, one for Best Rock Performance and the other for Best Rock Song.\nWhen the song was first released on Coldplay's YouTube channel, it sparked many negative comments in the comment section, saying the song was plagiarised from \"Ritmo de la noche\" by 1990s-era German group Chocolate, or from Peter Allen's \"I Go to Rio\". However, upon release of the song, the line \"Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall contains elements of I Go To Rio written by Peter Allen and Adrienne Anderson\" was noted below the official lyrics to the song on Coldplay's website.\nThe Oracle (Coldplay's web site Question and Answer section) responded on 9 June 2011 to a question raised concerning its inspiration and collaboration:\nI don't think people are quite understanding the song's composition. To clarify: Chris was inspired to write Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall after hearing some chords in a nightclub scene in Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's film Biutiful (2010). The chords in the film are part of a track that is based on I Go To Rio written by Peter Allen and Adrienne Anderson, released by Peter Allen in 1976. If you look at a clip on YouTube you'll hear the chords for yourself. As for other people asking if Ritmo de la Noche by The Sacados should also be credited the answer is \"no\". Firstly, that is a cover of Chocolate's song by the same name who sampled I Go To Rio. Secondly, they both came later in 1990 so hopefully they should have credited Peter & Adrienne.\nThis is not the first time that Coldplay have used samples to write a new song, having used a Kraftwerk motif for their X&Y single \"Talk\".\n\"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\" received generally positive reviews from critics. The Boston Herald gave a positive review, saying \"Chris Martin does it again. He gives force to wimp music, beauty to base pop and the world another Coldplay anthem. Basically, the boys are joyous, and so is this stadium-rock track. 'I turn the music up, I got my records on, I shut the world outside until the lights come on' Martin sings over buoyant synths, ringing guitar and big drums. You can feel the love and hear the band's next chart-topper all at once.\"\nRolling Stone gave the song a three and a half stars rating out of five commenting \"Chris Martin says Coldplay's upcoming album is influenced by old-school New York graffiti, and in a recent photo the bandmates are dressed in neon chillwear like they just walked off the set of Breakin' 3: A Brit-Pop Odyssey. But the first single doesn't go for the sound of early hip-hop so much as its sense of year-zero possibility. Over a rave-tinged keyboard melody, leavened by producer Brian Eno's rainforest-of-the-soul ambiance, Martin sings of kids dancing until morning and heaven inside his headphones. When the drums kick in fully, it moves like \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" by way of the Velvets' \"Sunday Morning,\" a flag-waving ode to change-as-inspiration: \"I'd rather be a comma than a full stop,\" Martin sings. Coming from a guy whose critics take him for a human exclamation point, it's a welcome sentiment.\"\nMTV praised the song, stating \"Modern rock behemoths"

It is the fourth track from their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams. It features uncredited guest vocals by Gwyneth Paltrow, who at the time was married to Chris Martin despite their separation being announced in 2014. The track premiered during Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show on 26 November 2015 and was originally released as a promotional single for the album on 27 November 2015.\nOn 11 November 2016, however, the song was released as the fourth official single from the album through a newly recorded stripped-down version, which was inspired by Martin's unrehearsed solo performance of the song at the recent Glastonbury Festival. This recording ends with a sample of Muhammad Ali's 1977 speech in Newcastle upon Tyne. \nThe track revolves around a heartfelt piano riff and was written in the key of C# Minor at 73 BPM and a chord progression that alternates between C#m-A-E-G#m7 and C#m-A-E-B.\nMartin came up with the idea for the title of the song from a slang word he heard from a surfer. In an interview with Zane Lowe, he explained the origin of the phrase: \"I was in the ocean one day with this surfer guy, who spoke just like you'd imagine a surfer guy to speak \u2026 This guy spoke like Sean Penn's character from Fast Times at Ridgemont High. He was like, 'Yo dude, I was doing this thing the other day man, it gave me this total everglow!'\"\nThe song was debuted during the iHeartRadio album release party of A Head Full of Dreams, on 19 November 2015. On June 26, 2016, Coldplay performed at Glastonbury Festival and after introducing the band, Chris Martin announced they were going to play Everglow. Chris' piano was out of tune causing Martin to stop and do the song in a key down, so he played the song with the piano, without the other members of the band. Days later, on July 3, 2016, the band started to play that stripped back version of Everglow, and on November 11, 2016 it was released as the final single of the album because of how much they liked the live performance.\nAn initial video directed by Joe Connor was filmed at the Eisstadion am Pferdeturm in Hanover on 30 June 2016, but was unreleased. This video was leaked online in 2017. Another video filmed by Ben Mor, featuring Chris Martin performing the song on a grand piano, was released on 9 December 2016.\n\nCredits are adapted from A Head Full of Dreams liner notes.\nColdplay\nGuy Berryman \u2013 bass guitar\nJonny Buckland \u2013 guitar\nWill Champion \u2013 drums, drum pad, percussion, backing vocals\nChris Martin \u2013 lead vocals, piano\nAdditional musicians\nMikkel S Eriksen \u2013 additional instruments, production, mixing\nTor Erik Hermansen \u2013 additional instruments, production, mixing\nGwyneth Paltrow \u2013 backing vocals\nDavide Rossi \u2013 strings\nRik Simpson \u2013 additional instruments, backing vocals, mixing\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease as a promotional single.\n\"Hear Coldplay's Heartfelt New Ballad 'Everglow'\".

The song features vocals by American singer-songwriter Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic. It was released in the United States as the second single from the album on October 9, 2010, by Cherrytree and Interscope Records. According to the group, the song regards \"flying to make those dreams happen for the one you love\". They also cited the song was inspired by themselves as \"LA Dreamers living on a dream and never knowing where it would take you\".\nThe pop-rap song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Some of them called it one of the highlights of Free Wired, \"catchy\" and noticed the keyboard chords resembled those of \"Somebody to Love\" (2010) by Justin Bieber, which led to speculation that \"Rocketeer\" copied from the track. However, both songs were produced by the Stereotypes, with the latter being the first. In the US, the song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and Mainstream Top 40 charts, respectively. It also peaked at number six on the Rhythmic chart and number nine on Hot Rap Songs. The song entered at its peak of number 14 on the UK Singles Chart and reached number 11 in Slovakia. It peaked at number four in New Zealand, ten on Japan Hot 100 and number 14 in Australia.\nDirector Marc Klasfeld shot the accompanying music video. It depicts a love story between a young couple, who will have to go their separate ways since the girl has to leave for a job in Japan. During the video, her boyfriend is seen gathering material for a \"make-shift\" jet pack to get to her after she leaves. At the end of the video, he goes \"off into the night, leaving a trail of sparks behind him\". A short film, titled \"Rocketeer (LA Dreamer Short Film)\", was also released in dedication to their hometown, along with a new version of \"Rocketeer\". Far East Movement performed the song live in various shows, such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Conan, and the Billboard Music Awards.\nA demo of \"Rocketeer\" was first recorded with vocals from Bruno Mars, which were replaced by Ryan Tedder's vocals on the final version, with the version ultimately being included on Far East Movement's album Free Wired in October 2010. The former version leaked on April 13, 2011. After the success of the lead single, \"Like a G6\", the group felt pressure to re-create it. However, instead of releasing \"another dance song\", there was a need to come up something different for showing their range as musicians. As a result, \"Rocketeer\" marked a departure from Far East Movement's usual sound.\nKev Nish, one of the members of the group, commented in an interview to Blues & Soul: \"We'd basically go in the studio and take hip hop-style drums, electronic synths, alternative-style hooks and just mash it all UP! Which in turn became the inspiration behind a track like 'Rocketeer'... And, by featuring Ryan Tedder on the song, we were then also able to cover that credible, alternative rock base.\" Far East Movement detailed the process of the song's creation; they decided to change \"the tempo and fuse a slower paced hip hop track with electro synths and an alternative style hook\". According to them, the lyrics are \"about flying to make those dreams happen for the one you love\". Moreover, the group affirmed the track was \"inspired by how we grew up in Downtown LA as LA Dreamers living on a dream and never knowing where it would take you. We wanted to paint a portrait of where we live, from where we started, to the free wired mashed up community of dreamers that make up LA.\"\n\"Rocketeer\" was written by Jae Choung, James Roh, Kevin Nishimura, and Virman Coquia, whom are collectively known as Far East Movement, with additional songwriting by Jeremy Reeves, Johnathan Yip, and Ray Romulus, whom are collectively known as the Stereotypes, as well as by Mars and Philip Lawrence, also known as the Smeezingtons. The song was produced by the Stereotypes and the Smeezingtons, while it was recorded by the former team at Short Bus Studios in North Hollywood. Jaycen Joshua mixed \"Rocketeer\", with Giancarlo Lino and Jesus Garnica as mixing assistants. It was mastered by Brian"

Cole. The song was released on January 23, 2019, through Dreamville Records, Roc Nation and Interscope Records, as the first single from Dreamville's 2019 compilation album, Revenge of the Dreamers III. The song was written by J. Cole, Allan Felder, Norman Harris, and Tyler Williams and produced by T-Minus and Cole. It was serviced to rhythmic and urban contemporary radio on February 5, 2019. The track contains a sample from \"Wake Up to Me\", written by Felder and Harris, as performed by First Choice. On the song, J. Cole explores \"his place between the old and new generations of hip hop, making him the 'middle child' of rap.\"\nOn January 20, 2019, J. Cole cleared his Instagram page, the next day Cole cryptically posted a series of posts with lines from the song. They read: I'm Counting My Bullets, I'm Loading My Clips, I'm Writing Down Names, and I'm Making A List, Cole later deleted the posts. Later that same day, Cole announced on social media that he was releasing \"Middle Child\" on January 23, 2019, at 9:00 PM EST, and uploaded the cover which featured the song's title capitalized over a grey background.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, in an interview with Complex, producer T-Minus revealed that they made the song about two months before the highly promoted Dreamville recording sessions, which were held the same month \"Middle Child\" was released. He also spoke about the process he and Cole took making the song: \nNo. Well, the way we work is we kind of just start from scratch, and we just brainstorm from there. Him and his manager had an idea to pull a sample out, so we went online and we found this really cool loop. The moment we heard it, we all reacted to it. Cole fell in love with it, and I could tell he had the vision for what he wanted. So he heard the sample and we were like, \"Yo, we gotta do something on this.\" So we started filling the track out. It all happened in one day. We filled this beat out, he started writing to it, he recorded it\u2014it was pretty much done within that day. The whole record. It was just a moment and it was actually one of the last days of sessions that we did. We did like a five day run of just working, and it was the last day, so it came right in the nick of time.\n\"Middle Child\" was produced by both J. Cole and Canadian hip-hop producer T-Minus. The song includes an exclusive multi-track sample of the horns section from \"Wake Up to Me\" by '70s Philadelphia trio First Choice, which was found and cleared through music licensing site Tracklib. This allowed them to isolate horns before adding in the drums. In an episode of Genius' Deconstructed, T-Minus explained he \"put some reverb on [the horn sample] to give it that effect of it being a little bit more airy, a little bit bigger\". Next was the addition of drums to the song, which T-Minus said was reminiscent of KOD \"'cause a lot of it's very like stuttery kind of hats, very short but rhythmic\". The drums added a variety of sounds, but J. Cole wanted to add an 808 pattern to the song, with the beat going from high to low. T-Minus noted the 808 for being \"really hard\" and also incorporated hi-hats to add \"more energy to the song when it drops\". The last production detail was including T-Minus' signature \"trippy vibe\", which he previously utilized on song like Kendrick Lamar's \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\" and Lil Wayne's \"She Will\"\u2014\"at the end of the record, we kind of added this effect to make everything kind of sound dark and kind of trippy\".\nWith only one day of tracking, the song debuted at number 26 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The following week, the song peaked at number 4, later becoming J. Cole's best performing track and highest-charting song until the release of My Life with 21 Savage & Morray, which peaked at number two. The song also peaked at number 2 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\nAn accompanying music video for the track was uploaded onto Cole's official YouTube channel on February 25, 2019. Cole announced the video via Twitter on February 22, 2019. The video was shot in Georgia, and was directed by fellow North Carolina rapper Mez, and features cameos from Dreamville artists Lute, Omen and Cozz. The video serves as Mez' first directed video.\n\nIn an interview with Complex, Mez spoke about the creation of the video, he said: \nI came up with everything from scratch, but [J. Cole's go-to director] Scott [Lazer]"

The song was released as the lead single from Eminem's album Relapse (2009). On February 12, 2009, the song broke the first week digital sales record with 418,000 downloads, topping the previous record held by \"Live Your Life\" by T.I. featuring Rihanna. This record was broken again the following week by \"Right Round\" by Flo Rida. The song won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 2010.\n\"Crack a Bottle\" initially gained attention in December 2008, when an unfinished version of the song was initially leaked under the name \"Number One\" on the mixtape 4th Quarter Pressure Part 2, while a final working version was leaked on January 6, 2009. Various media outlets had reported that the recording was to be the first single from Eminem's 2009 album Relapse, however the Italian branch of Universal Music Group, owner of Interscope Records, later denied this, stating that \"Crack a Bottle\" was only a promotional recording. Despite all this, the song was released on February 2, 2009, and made available for paid digital download, with 50 Cent stating that the song will be included on his upcoming album Before I Self Destruct. According to Danielle Harling of HipHopDX\u2014a website dedicated to hip hop music coverage\u2014the song will ultimately be present on both Relapse and Before I Self Destruct, while in contrast, Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone Magazine stated that it is still unsure which rapper will feature this song on his upcoming album. Despite the confusion, Universal eventually announced that \"Crack a Bottle\" would be included in Relapse, although it did not consider it the album's first single. The song samples \"Mais dans la lumi\u00e8re\" by Mike Brant, written by Jean Renard, who also received songwriting credits for the song. The same sample is used in the song Preservation by Aesop Rock and Del tha Funkee Homosapien, found on Wu-Tang Clan's 2005 album Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture. The song is in the key of C-sharp minor. American rapper Jay Rock released a remix to the song. Rappers Cashis and Bobby Creekwater were featured in the official remix of \"Crack a Bottle\". Rick Ross also released a remix as a diss to G-Unit.\nBillboard gave a positive review of the song: \"Although not quite as strong as the title track to Eminem's 2004 album Encore, the return of Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent has been anticipated for a long time, and it is sure to put Eminem back atop the marquee. His skills remain some of the best in hip-hop, and the accompanying contributions make the music that little bit more stronger.\" Rolling Stone Magazine commented negatively on the song, saying that it is one of the weakest tracks on the album, along the other single \"We Made You\". The song won at the 52nd Grammy Awards in the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group category.\nDuring an interview for MTV, 50 Cent originally told that there were plans to make an animated music video for \"Crack a Bottle\", which was to be shot along with a music video for 50 Cent's song \"I Get It In\". On February 25, Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg posted on his blog a still frame from the music video illustrating a homeless person holding a bottle wrapped in a brown bag. According to Rosenberg, it is directed by Syndrome and was planned to be released within a couple of weeks. The music video was playing on TV in Eminem's music video \"3 a.m.\", which has been directed by Syndrome as well. On May 7, 2009, an unfinished version of the video was released via TheRelapse.com, featuring Eminem's verse and chorus. Later during the same day, 50 Cent's rapped verse of the video was released via ThisIs50.com as well. This was added to the unfinished video on therelapse.com. A month later, on June 7, 2009, Cashis posted a link on Twitter to the full video in which he makes a cameo appearance. The music video portrays each rappers' style; Eminem's chaotic style, Dr. Dre's West Coast style, and 50 Cent's more club oriented style. None of the performers are featured in the video.\n\nDigital download\nPromotional CD single\nSince its release, \"Crack a Bottle\" has charted mainly in the United States, entering various charts including the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.

Cole. The song was released on January 23, 2019, through Dreamville Records, Roc Nation and Interscope Records, as the first single from Dreamville's 2019 compilation album, Revenge of the Dreamers III. The song was written by J. Cole, Allan Felder, Norman Harris, and Tyler Williams and produced by T-Minus and Cole. It was serviced to rhythmic and urban contemporary radio on February 5, 2019. The track contains a sample from \"Wake Up to Me\", written by Felder and Harris, as performed by First Choice. On the song, J. Cole explores \"his place between the old and new generations of hip hop, making him the 'middle child' of rap.\"\nOn January 20, 2019, J. Cole cleared his Instagram page, the next day Cole cryptically posted a series of posts with lines from the song. They read: I'm Counting My Bullets, I'm Loading My Clips, I'm Writing Down Names, and I'm Making A List, Cole later deleted the posts. Later that same day, Cole announced on social media that he was releasing \"Middle Child\" on January 23, 2019, at 9:00 PM EST, and uploaded the cover which featured the song's title capitalized over a grey background.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, in an interview with Complex, producer T-Minus revealed that they made the song about two months before the highly promoted Dreamville recording sessions, which were held the same month \"Middle Child\" was released. He also spoke about the process he and Cole took making the song: \nNo. Well, the way we work is we kind of just start from scratch, and we just brainstorm from there. Him and his manager had an idea to pull a sample out, so we went online and we found this really cool loop. The moment we heard it, we all reacted to it. Cole fell in love with it, and I could tell he had the vision for what he wanted. So he heard the sample and we were like, \"Yo, we gotta do something on this.\" So we started filling the track out. It all happened in one day. We filled this beat out, he started writing to it, he recorded it\u2014it was pretty much done within that day. The whole record. It was just a moment and it was actually one of the last days of sessions that we did. We did like a five day run of just working, and it was the last day, so it came right in the nick of time.\n\"Middle Child\" was produced by both J. Cole and Canadian hip-hop producer T-Minus. The song includes an exclusive multi-track sample of the horns section from \"Wake Up to Me\" by '70s Philadelphia trio First Choice, which was found and cleared through music licensing site Tracklib. This allowed them to isolate horns before adding in the drums. In an episode of Genius' Deconstructed, T-Minus explained he \"put some reverb on [the horn sample] to give it that effect of it being a little bit more airy, a little bit bigger\". Next was the addition of drums to the song, which T-Minus said was reminiscent of KOD \"'cause a lot of it's very like stuttery kind of hats, very short but rhythmic\". The drums added a variety of sounds, but J. Cole wanted to add an 808 pattern to the song, with the beat going from high to low. T-Minus noted the 808 for being \"really hard\" and also incorporated hi-hats to add \"more energy to the song when it drops\". The last production detail was including T-Minus' signature \"trippy vibe\", which he previously utilized on song like Kendrick Lamar's \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\" and Lil Wayne's \"She Will\"\u2014\"at the end of the record, we kind of added this effect to make everything kind of sound dark and kind of trippy\".\nWith only one day of tracking, the song debuted at number 26 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The following week, the song peaked at number 4, later becoming J. Cole's best performing track and highest-charting song until the release of My Life with 21 Savage & Morray, which peaked at number two. The song also peaked at number 2 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\nAn accompanying music video for the track was uploaded onto Cole's official YouTube channel on February 25, 2019. Cole announced the video via Twitter on February 22, 2019. The video was shot in Georgia, and was directed by fellow North Carolina rapper Mez, and features cameos from Dreamville artists Lute, Omen and Cozz. The video serves as Mez' first directed video.\n\nIn an interview with Complex, Mez spoke about the creation of the video, he said: \nI came up with everything from scratch, but [J. Cole's go-to director] Scott [Lazer]"

The song, released on August 27, 2013, is the first single from Eminem's eighth studio album The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The song was produced by Rick Rubin and samples Billy Squier's \"The Stroke\", as well as the Beastie Boys' \"Fight for Your Right\", taken from their 1986 debut album Licensed to Ill, which Rubin had also produced, and Naughty by Nature's \"Feel Me Flow\". The song was heavily downloaded in its first week of release, resulting in the song debuting at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100.\nThe song, produced by Rick Rubin, samples Billy Squier's \"The Stroke\", the Beastie Boys' \"Fight for Your Right\", taken from their 1986 debut album Licensed to Ill and also produced by Rubin, and Naughty by Nature's \"Feel Me Flow\".\nThe song starts with a \"blast of static, hard guitar and Em roaring out of the gate sounding like the long-lost, fourth Beastie Boy\", according to Yahoo! Music critic Craig Rosen. The song samples the \"Kick it!\" part of \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)\", performed by Ad-Rock. According to Billboard's Lars Brandle, the song is \"a punchy, guitar-and-beats driven song which channels Joan Jett & the Blackhearts' I Love Rock 'n' Roll and Licensed to Ill-era Beastie Boys.\"\nDuring the halftime at the September 7, 2013 Michigan\u2013Notre Dame football game, Eminem premiered a preview of the music video for \"Berzerk\". Then the video was premiered two days later on September 9, via VEVO. The video was filmed in Brooklyn, New York and directed by Syndrome. It features cameo appearances from fellow American rappers Kendrick Lamar and Kid Rock (both of whom Eminem mentions in the song's lyrics) in addition to Shady Records labelmates Slaughterhouse, Mr. Porter, Yelawolf and The Alchemist, the song's producer Rick Rubin and Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg. The video also features short clips of backyard wrestling, and public fights as well as short clips of the official music video of Billy Squier's \"The Stroke\", which is heavily sampled in the song. The video received a nomination at MTV Video Music Awards 2014 in the category \"Best Hip-Hop Video\".\n\"Berzerk\" originally premiered on August 26, on SiriusXM channel, Shade 45. The Marshall Mathers LP 2, a sequel to Eminem's acclaimed studio effort The Marshall Mathers LP, was revealed during MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, 2013 with two previews of \"Berzerk\" via Beats By Dr. Dre commercials. Some critics describe Eminem's return in these commercials as the highlight of the show. The video that accompanied the song featured a boombox prominently. The song was the featured song for the 2013 season of Saturday Night Football, debuting with the September 7 Michigan\u2013Notre Dame football rivalry game.\n\"Berzerk\" sold 362,000 downloads in its first week in the US, debuting at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 (behind Katy Perry's Roar and Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines) becoming Eminem's 15th Top 10 hit on the Hot 100. The song has peaked at number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. When the R&B component of the chart is removed, the song debuted at number one on the Rap Songs chart. \"Berzerk\"'s debut is just below the debut of the lead single for Recovery, \"Not Afraid\", which sold 379,000 copies in its first week. It has sold over a million copies in the US as of October 2013.\nIn Canada, the song debuted at number two with 50,000 downloads sold, which more than doubled the 24,000 downloads sold in the debut week of \"Not Afraid\". It was Eminem's best one week download total ever in the country, until it was surpassed by the 54,000 downloads sold for Eminem's later single, \"The Monster\". The song was certified Double Platinum in Digital downloads in Canada on November 1, 2013.\nThe song debuted at number one on the UK R&B Chart and was replaced on the chart by his single \"Rap God\".\nWill Hermes of Rolling Stone gave the song 4 out of 5 stars, highlighting its goal to \"celebrate old-school hip-hop\". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song 4 out of 5 stars, stating the song \"harks back\" to Eminem's \"Slim Shady days\". Copsey compared the song to Beastie Boys circa 1986, although the song as \"inimitable\" and \"unmistakably Eminem\". VH1 India gave the song 8/10 concluding, \"Whether you shudder under 'Berzerk's' cacophonous assault or wear its raps like an emblem \u2014 it's 2013, and Eminem still got your"

It was written by Static Major, Eric Seats and Rapture Stewart. Despite Aaliyah initially starting promotion for the expected second single \"More Than a Woman\", Blackground Records and Virgin Records posthumously serviced \"Rock the Boat\" to urban adult contemporary radio as the second single from Aaliyah on September 25, 2001.\n\"Rock the Boat\" peaked at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100 dated January 5, 2002. The song stayed on the chart for 25 weeks. It was nominated for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\"Rock the Boat\" came into fruition almost by accident, because producer Eric Seats almost deleted the song's file. The file nearly got deleted because Seats didn't like what he heard right away. Seats explained, \"I almost deleted 'Rock The Boat' because I'm the kind of guy that once I start producing a track and I don't feel it right away sometimes, I would delete it and just start something over fresh.\" The song was saved when songwriter Static Major heard the instrumental of the song through headphones and quickly wrote the hook for the song.\nAccording to Seats. \"Static heard it through my headphones. I took a break and went to the restroom, and by the time I got back he had already written a hook.\" When discussing the fate of the song, he then proceeded to say, \"I wouldn't say it was an accident, but we weren't vibing with it as much. It was one of those things like if he had came 10 minutes later, he probably would've never heard it.\" During the early stages of the song \"it was very raw\" and since Static Major showed strong interest in the song, Seats continued to develop the song. Seats mentioned, \"Since he had an interest in it, I said, 'Let me go and continue building on it, let me embellish it, make something happen since you're feeling it.' We didn't know it was going to end up being 'Rock The Boat'.\" Seats \"beefed\" up the development process of the track by calling Dave Foreman and Rapture Stewart to add a guitar and strings to the songs instrumental.\nOriginally, \"More than A Woman\" was chosen as the second single from Aaliyah's self titled album, but due to heavy radio airplay \"Rock the Boat\" became the second single. According to producer Rapture Stewart, \"The only reason they shot 'Rock the Boat' was because the radio was already playing it, so that kind of forced it to be the second single (instead of 'More Than a Woman').\" Although \"Rock the Boat\" received heavy radio airplay, Aaliyah's label didn't want the song to be released as a single. Instead, the label felt that songs produced by Timbaland should have been released as singles because \"that was her sound at the time\", according to Stewart. Aaliyah, who loved \"Rock the Boat\", fought with her label and pushed for the song to become the album's second single. Seats recalled hearing Aaliyah say, \"No, it's this one. I don't care who did what. This one is the next one,\" during an argument.\n\"Rock the Boat\" is described as being a Caribbean-flavored sensual and smooth mid-tempo song. The song features an atmospheric groove, hypnotic rhythms, and fluctuating instrumentation such as synthesizer effects. Michael Odell from the British publication The Guardian felt that \"Rock the Boat\" pays tribute to synth-driven 1980s soul\". On the song, \"Aaliyah's tentative vocal finds its way around a menu of high-octane sexual requests,\" according to reviewer Michael Odell of The Guardian. Lyrically, its female narrator instructs a lover on how to please her sexually and equates her erotic high to a drug high: \"Work the middle / Change positions / Now stroke it for me /  ... I feel like I'm on dope / Explore my body /.\" Nateleg\u00e9 Whaley of Mic opined that \"she is captain of her physical needs in the bedroom and confidently directs the voyage. She knew what she wanted and knew how to get it.\" According to producer Bud'da, Aaliyah debated about if the song should include the line \"Feels like I'm on dope\" because she didn't want to send the wrong message to her fans about drugs.\nKhal from Complex felt that the video for the song matched the laid-back vibe of the instrumental. According to Khal, \"The end result was a thing of beauty, with tropical visuals properly matching the laid back vibe of the instrumental. Perfect percussive accents dwell around the chilled melodies.\" James Poletti from dotmusic felt that Aaliyah's \"breathy vocals become stutteringly"

It remained in the Billboard Hot 100 for 13 consecutive weeks spanning from June 2, 2001, until August 25, 2001.\nDuring the recording process for her third album Aaliyah was also filming her second movie Queen of the Damned in Australia. Due to her hectic schedule at that time, Aaliyah decided to record her album simultaneously while filming a movie. In order for it to be possible to record an album while filming a movie Aaliyah's team of producers traveled to Australia with her. Majority of the producers who are featured on the album went to Australia to with the exception of Timbaland. Due to unforeseen issues at that time with Blackground Records Timbaland was not expected to appear on Aaliyah's album at all. According to Tim Barnett, former assistant to songwriter Static Major, \"We went back to New York and did them in either Sound King or Manhattan studio. We did them right after the New Year. Part of the problem was Timbaland and Missy weren't even going to be on the album because of problems with Blackground. Aaliyah talked Tim into producing records for the album, so Timbaland did it out of love for Babygirl.\" Once Aaliyah reached out to Timbaland and asked him to produce songs for the album there were constant doubts about him meeting his deadline in time due to it being last minute. According to producer Rapture Stewart Timbaland came on board for the album during the last week before the album was finalized. Stewart also stated \"Timbaland was so busy that he wasn't able to do his songs until the last week and they didn't know if he was going to make it in time for him to do it\". Due to the uncertainty with Timbaland being able to make his deadline in time the song \"Loose Rap\" was chosen as the album's lead single. Once Timbaland submitted his songs within the deadline Aaliyah's record label decided that \"We Need a Resolution\" was going to be the lead single instead.\n\"We Need a Resolution\" has been described as having a \"seductive Middle Eastern vibe\" \"as the backing track slithers along with an almost Egyptian feel\". According to  Nateleg\u00e9 Whaley from Mic \"We Need a Resolution\" opens with warpy clarinet samples as Timbaland  dodges confrontation by repeatedly saying \"I'm tired of arguing girl.\" Aaliyah's first line in the song cuts to the chase, responding in a chill, direct manner: \"Did you sleep on the wrong side?/ I'm catching a bad vibe.\"\nOn \"We Need a Resolution\" \"Timbaland combines idiosyncratic beats, moody, off-key melodies and an insistent, dirgelike chorus for a strangely hypnotic effect\". Also the song's production has a sparse arrangement with stop-start drum patterns and hand claps. Lyrically the song maturely presents two perspectives in a passive-aggressive relationship. Aaliyah's sinuously sung concerns are playfully dismissed in Timbaland's featured rap. The song leaves its hook unresolved, plays backwards after Timbaland's rap, and concludes with a reversed loop of the vocal \"where were you last night\", which echoes the female protagonist's sentiment.\nChuck Taylor from Billboard gave the song a mixed review, although he praised Aaliyah's vocal delivery by saying, \"Aaliyah's light but direct delivery complements the hectic track well\" he ultimately felt that the overall song was classic Aaliyah and he expressed that he hoped that she would show more growth and variety just as well as she is building her budding acting resume.

It was the lead single for their 2012 album Coexist. The song was written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft, bassist Oliver Sim, and percussionist Jamie xx, who also produced it.\nThe xx premiered the song on 14 May 2012 at their first live show since touring in 2010. Upon its release, \"Angels\" received positive reviews from music critics, who commended Croft's performance and the song's minimalist musical style. The song was remixed by electronic musician Four Tet, whose version was aired on BBC Radio on 19 September.\n\"Angels\" was recorded during the sessions for Coexist at The xx's recording studio in London. Its demo was originally recorded solely by Romy Madley Croft, who wrote the song's lyrics. Jamie xx said of the song's recording in an interview for Spin, \"It took a while to work out how to arrange it for the band. The demo was quite perfect, but it was just Romy. It took the entire length of the recording process to get it right.\"\n\"Angels\" is a sparsely-produced, gentle ballad about the idea of being in love. It has a measured pace and features slight vocals and whispered cadences by Croft, background baritone bass, subtle drum thuds, and coiling guitar lines. Pitchfork Media's Larry Fitzmaurice observes on the song \"lots of hollow space surrounding [that] add[s] intimacy.\" \"Angels\" opens with echoey guitar and Romy's vocals, which are at the front of the mix. Eerie snare rolls appear within a minute of the song, but quickly fade away. Arnold Pan of PopMatters writes that, in the context of Coexist, the song has its \"own sense of development\" and \"resolution\". Oliver Sim said of this moment of tension in the song, \"Early on, Jamie said something about the album being inspired by dance music, so everyone's expecting a house beat to drop halfway through\u2014which is hilarious because this is not a dance record.\"\nCroft's transparent lyrics express lovesick emotion, adoration, and private knowledge acquired from intimacy: \"You move through the room / Like breathing was easy / If someone believed me / They would be as in love with you as I am\". They also compare a relationship that ended prematurely to \"dreaming of angels, and leaving without them\". Her repetition of \"love\" in the song's chorus expresses the depth and intensity of the narrator's feeling. Priya Elan of NME opines that she repeats the word \"like she's been sucker-punched by the sheer intensity of her heart-shaped feeling. She's revelling in the joy of it, but also realising the utter failure of the simple four-letter word to express the depth of what she's experiencing.\" Croft said that the song is \"very positive lyrically\" and that its album \"goes through a few different stages, and this would be the lightest.\" Puja Patel of Spin characterizes its subject matter as \"loverlorn\" and observes a balance \"between honest[y], gut-wrenching desire and stalker-like idolization\".\nThe xx premiered the song at Electrowerkz in Islington, London on 14 May 2012, their first live show since 2010. They subsequently performed \"Angels\" on Conan on 24 July.\nPitchfork Media's Larry Fitzmaurice noted the song's \"percussive touch\" as an indication that \"the xx are changing ... slowly and subtly, two characteristics that's always been part of their central appeal.\" Si\u00e2n Rowe of NME called it \"a heart-meltingly perfect follow-on from their debut\", and the magazine's Priya Elan dubbed it \"the boldest Valentine the band have ever recorded.\" Michael Cragg of The Guardian commented that \"their ability to make minimalism seem warm and comforting [is] still intact.\" Allmusic's Heather Phares called the song a \"lovely album opener\" and wrote that the band's \"elegantly serpentine guitars \u2014 which recalled the Cure and Durutti Column on xx ... are now entirely their own\". The Quietus critiqued that \"it feels a bit more confident; where Oliver Sim and Madley-Croft's wordplay on their debut was tentative, there's a newfound directness\". Brendan Frank of Beats Per Minute commended Croft for \"delivering a simple love note to an anonymous recipient,\" adding that \"she does a magnificent job of carrying the piece on her own.\" Stephen Thompson of NPR called \"Angels\" a \"gentle love song made all the more disarming for its simplicity,\" writing that it \"ratchets up the tension using the fewest possible ingredients.\" In Australia, the song was voted by members of the public to number 19 on Triple J Hottest 100 of 2012.\nIn 2012, British band Bastille covered \"Angels\" alongside TLC's \"No Scrubs\" in a mash-up entitled \"No Angels\".

It was written by Static Major and Timbaland, who also produced and contributed a featured rap. The song was released on April 13, 2001, as the lead single for Aaliyah's self-titled 2001 album Aaliyah.\nThe song was a moderate success internationally. \"We Need a Resolution\" reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart and the top 30 in Canada. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 119 on its list 150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years.

It was released as a single in October 1982 and became a surprise hit, reaching number 5 in the UK Singles Chart the following month and number 2 in the Irish Singles Chart.\nThe song was written \"in a couple of hours\", credited to P\u00f3l and Ciar\u00e1n Brennan. Gerald Seymour, author of Harry's Game, originally wanted to use \"Mhorag 's Na Horo Gheallaidh\", a Scottish Gaelic song from Clannad's album Fuaim, but Clannad felt Irish-language lyrics would be more appropriate. The verse is adapted from a Connacht Irish proverb in a 1948 anthology, glossed by M\u00e1ire (Moya) Brennan as \"Everything that is and was will cease to be.\" This was considered appropriate to the miniseries' depiction of the futility of political violence.\nThe song is to date the only British hit single ever to have been sung entirely in Irish. The chorus \"Fol lol the doh fol the day, Fol the doh fol the day\", is ancient Irish mouth-music, known as Portaireacht, which is common in traditional music.\nOver previous albums, Clannad's sound had moved away from traditional Irish music arrangements, and the production of \"Theme from Harry's Game\", using lush slow layers of synthesiser and vocal harmony, marked the arrival of what would become their signature style for the next decade.\nThe song won an Ivor Novello award, and launched Clannad's global career. Its success delayed the release of the band's 1983 album Magical Ring, which was altered to include it and more material in the same style.\nIt has since appeared in several Hollywood movies, most notably Patriot Games, in which an IRA member, played by Patrick Bergin, is seen watching the music video for the song on his television.\nClannad's 1990 album Anam was released in the United States in 1992 to capitalise on the Patriot Games exposure, with \"Harry's Game\" inserted in the tracklist; the album sold well and the track was often broadcast on VH1. Its use from late 1992 in a Volkswagen Passat commercial introduced Clannad to a broader American audience and boosted sales of Anam.\nThe song also features on Clannad's vocalists' live albums, the 2005 album \u00d3r\u00f3 - A Live Session and the 2008 Moya Brennan solo album Heart Strings. The original has also been sampled various times by artists such as Kaleef and Elate. Moya Brennan recorded a solo version at Mothership Studio for dance musician Chicane, which he used on his UK top 10 hit \"Saltwater.\"\nTheme From Harry's Game \u2013 2:30\nStrayed Away \u2013 2:47\n\n\n\nIn 1989, as part of the promotion for their compilation Pastpresent, Clannad re-released the \"Theme from Harry's Game\" as an AA-side single with their new song \"Hourglass.\"\nIn 1992, the \"Theme from Harry's Game\" was used in the soundtrack to the film Patriot Games, and it was also re-released as a single. There were two versions of the CD single, a two-track and a four-track version, both with the same cover and catalogue number.\n7\" single, cassette, 5\" compact disc\n\"Theme from Harry's Game\"\n\"Robin (The Hooded Man)\"\n5\" compact disc\n\"Theme from Harry's Game\"\n\"Robin (The Hooded Man)\"\n\"In a Lifetime\"\n\"Closer to your Heart\"\nIn 1993, in connection with an advertising campaign for Jameson Whiskey, both \"Theme from Harry's Game\" and \"In A Lifetime\" were re-released in The Netherlands.\n\"Theme from Harry's Game\"\n\"Caisle\u00e1n \u00d3ir\"\nThe song has been covered by artists including Phil Coulter and Celtic Woman. The Irish rock band U2 also used the song as their outro during the War Tour, and it can be heard as such at the beginning and end of their live film U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky.

Roxanne Emery, Haliene, Matthew Steeper, and Karra wrote the song. It premiered in June 2016, during the Electric Daisy Carnival music festival and was digitally released on 30 January 2017. \"Saving Light\" is an uplifting trance song with lyrics about standing up to bullying and supporting victims by being their \"saving light\". Monstercat released the song as part of an initiative called \"Make Trance No. 1 Again\". Their goal was to encourage fans to purchase \"Saving Light\" on Beatport to support Ditch the Label and get the song to the top of the Beatport charts; this was achieved on 16 February 2017.\nCritical response to \"Saving Light\" was positive: critics praised Haliene's vocal performance and the song's composition. The song was voted the 2017 Tune of the Year on Armin van Buuren's radio show A State of Trance and the Best Original Trance track of 2017 by the r/EDM subreddit. \"Saving Light\" was featured on Monstercat 030 \u2013 Finale, released on 22 February 2017. Armada Music later re-released it as part of A State of Trance 2017.\nThe song's music video was shot and directed by Lee Jones and depicts a schoolgirl contemplating suicide after being a victim of bullying. The video received positive reviews and was praised for its depiction of bullying. The official remixes of \"Saving Light\" featured Notaker and Nwyr, and were released in August 2017. Various artists performed the song at music festivals such as Ultra Music Festival, Dreamstate Vancouver, and Bliss: Transcendence. Emery included \"Saving Light\" on his Laserface setlists.\nGareth Emery arranged Roxanne Emery, Haliene, Matthew Steeper, and Karra for a writing session in his home studio. Gareth Emery was not able to attend however and instead gave them a demo that he and Standerwick had been working on beforehand. Roxanne Emery suggested that they write a song about suicide; the lyrics were written in under an hour.\nHaliene provided vocals for the song; she explained its conception and depressing lyrical matter to Lisa-sun Nguyen of EDM Identity: \"My whole goal is to bring more love and light to this world through my music, encourage people, and encourage togetherness. Coming out of dark places like I have got me thinking, 'How can we spin this?'\"\nThe four wrote the song around a chorus played by Steeper on piano. Haliene sang the song to Gareth Emery and he believed it would be \"a really special song.\" Once the vocals were complete, Emery and Standerwick tried different musical styles for six months before settling on a classic trance interpretation. Standerwick and Emery produced 20 instrumentals of \"Saving Light\", some of which included an electronic dance music (EDM) drop and a dubstep section. Emery tested each version in DJ sets before the song was completed.\n\"Saving Light\" is an uplifting trance song that lasts four minutes and thirty-six seconds; its extended mix has a length of six minutes thirty-eight seconds. It features synthesizers accompanied by Haliene's vocal performance. The lyrics are about standing up to bullying and prejudice, suicide, and being a victim's \"saving light\". The song was described as emotional; an Earmilk columnist wrote that the producers followed a \"seemingly formulaic path\" in the creation of the track, though marked its melody as what stands out and makes the song's production speak to \"each level of talent involved\". Emery told Billboard that he did not want to get overly preachy or \"diverge into PSA territory\". He wanted to create a festival-suited trance song with a powerful message.\n\"Saving Light\" debuted at the Electric Daisy Carnival music festival in June 2016; fans assumed that the song was produced by Craig Connelly, though he later openly stated that the track was not his. On 30 January 2017, Emery and Standerwick released \"Saving Light\" as a digital download. On 22 February 2017, the song was re-released as part of Monstercat 030 \u2013 Finale.\n\"Saving Light\" was released as part of \"Make Trance No. 1 Again\", an initiative organised by Emery and Monstercat that encouraged fans to purchase the song via Beatport to support the anti-bullying charity Ditch the Label."

It was written by Static Major and Timbaland, who also produced and contributed a featured rap. The song was released on April 13, 2001, as the lead single for Aaliyah's self-titled 2001 album Aaliyah.\nThe song was a moderate success internationally. \"We Need a Resolution\" reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart and the top 30 in Canada. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 119 on its list 150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years. It was placed 21st on Slant Magazine's Best of the Aughts: Singles list and 30th on Stylus Magazine's Top 50 Singles: 2000\u20132005. The single and the music video was also ranked 8th and 6th, respectively, on Slant Magazine's Best Singles and Music Videos of 2001 list. dotmusic, which was formally a part of \"Launch\" on Yahoo, felt that this song was another classy slice of experimental R&B produced by Aaliyah. It remained in the Billboard Hot 100 for 13 consecutive weeks spanning from June 2, 2001, until August 25, 2001.\nDuring the recording process for her third album Aaliyah was also filming her second movie Queen of the Damned in Australia. Due to her hectic schedule at that time, Aaliyah decided to record her album simultaneously while filming a movie. In order for it to be possible to record an album while filming a movie Aaliyah's team of producers traveled to Australia with her. Majority of the producers who are featured on the album went to Australia to with the exception of Timbaland. Due to unforeseen issues at that time with Blackground Records Timbaland was not expected to appear on Aaliyah's album at all. According to Tim Barnett, former assistant to songwriter Static Major, \"We went back to New York and did them in either Sound King or Manhattan studio. We did them right after the New Year. Part of the problem was Timbaland and Missy weren't even going to be on the album because of problems with Blackground. Aaliyah talked Tim into producing records for the album, so Timbaland did it out of love for Babygirl.\" Once Aaliyah reached out to Timbaland and asked him to produce songs for the album there were constant doubts about him meeting his deadline in time due to it being last minute. According to producer Rapture Stewart Timbaland came on board for the album during the last week before the album was finalized. Stewart also stated \"Timbaland was so busy that he wasn't able to do his songs until the last week and they didn't know if he was going to make it in time for him to do it\". Due to the uncertainty with Timbaland being able to make his deadline in time the song \"Loose Rap\" was chosen as the album's lead single. Once Timbaland submitted his songs within the deadline Aaliyah's record label decided that \"We Need a Resolution\" was going to be the lead single instead.\n\"We Need a Resolution\" has been described as having a \"seductive Middle Eastern vibe\" \"as the backing track slithers along with an almost Egyptian feel\". According to  Nateleg\u00e9 Whaley from Mic \"We Need a Resolution\" opens with warpy clarinet samples as Timbaland  dodges confrontation by repeatedly saying \"I'm tired of arguing girl.\" Aaliyah's first line in the song cuts to the chase, responding in a chill, direct manner: \"Did you sleep on the wrong side?/ I'm catching a bad vibe.\"\nOn \"We Need a Resolution\" \"Timbaland combines idiosyncratic beats, moody, off-key melodies and an insistent, dirgelike chorus for a strangely hypnotic effect\". Also the song's production has a sparse arrangement with stop-start drum patterns and hand claps. Lyrically the song maturely presents two perspectives in a passive-aggressive relationship. Aaliyah's sinuously sung concerns are playfully dismissed in Timbaland's featured rap. The song leaves its hook unresolved, plays backwards after Timbaland's rap, and concludes with a reversed loop of the vocal \"where were you last night\", which echoes the female protagonist's sentiment.\nChuck Taylor from Billboard gave the song a mixed review, although he praised Aaliyah's vocal delivery by saying, \"Aaliyah's light but direct delivery complements the hectic track well\" he ultimately felt that the overall song was classic Aaliyah and he expressed that he hoped that she would show more growth and variety just as well as she is building her budding acting resume.

It was written by Lopez and Cory Rooney for the Adam Shankman-directed romantic comedy The Wedding Planner (2001). Shankman, however, felt that the song had too much of a Latin-influence to be featured in the film, and it was instead included on Lopez's second studio album, J.Lo (2001). \"Ain't It Funny\" was released as the third single from the album on June 20, 2001, by Epic Records.\nThe song was used as background music in three television advertisements in Japan to promote the 2001 Subaru Legacy for a special campaign which was known as Three Keys Legacy. Lopez herself was also featured in all three ads. The song shares the same title with Lopez's 2002 song \"Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)\", which is a completely different song.\nWhile watching a rough cut of The Wedding Planner (2001) in Canada, Jennifer Lopez and Cory Rooney brainstormed ideas for its accompanying soundtrack. The two \"pulled different thoughts and feelings\" from the film's scenes. The scene where Lopez's character is in the backseat of a car listening to Matthew McConaughey and Bridgette Wilson's characters talk about the wedding made Rooney think of the line \"ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny and you can't move on even though you try\". According to Rooney, \"all those words and melodies just started coming\" to him while watching the scene. After he conceived the idea for \"Ain't It Funny\", Rooney returned to his home and \"roughed out the track\" and composed the song's chorus. He then worked with Lopez for an hour to complete the song. Tommy Mottola was so enthusiastic about the song that he contributed to its melody. Adam Shankman, however, felt that \"Ain't It Funny\" had too much of a Latin influence for the film, due to its usage of timbales. Lopez disagreed with Shankman and the two later agreed to use \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" in the film.\n\"Ain't It Funny\" is a Latin pop song, with a duration of four minutes and six seconds (4:06). The song contains a Mecca disco beat and a \"bullfight trumpet\", as well as a \"solid dancefloor thump\". Lyrically, Lopez sings about \"creating the perfect romance in your mind, then facing reality when Mr. Right is less than ideal\".\nThe song received mixed to positive reviews. Josh Freedom du Lac of Wall of Sound wrote that \"Ain't It Funny\" steals its melody \"wholesale\" from Madonna's \"La Isla Bonita\", although it has a better rhythmic base. He concluded that it still \"sort of runs in place, as though Lopez recorded it while standing on a treadmill\". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine responded positively to the song, calling it \"terribly infectious\". However he criticized the \"overpowering choir of back-up vocalists\" that sing the chorus. Jake Barnes of Dot Music called the song bland, writing that Lopez should \"check out\" Jill Scott's 2000 song \"One Is the Magic Number\" for how Latin pop \"should be done properly\". Billboard's Chuck Taylor praised the song's production as \"Grade A\" and its lyrics as \"smart\".\n\"Ain't It Funny\" was a commercial success, peaking within the top ten in multiple countries. In Poland, the song peaked at No. 1 for eight weeks on the Polish Singles Chart. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at No. 3, making it her fifth top-ten single there, gaining popularity there it is still played on many radio stations regularly. \"Ain't It Funny\" charted at No. 3 in several other countries including the Netherlands, Romania and Sweden. In Sweden, it exceeded sales of 10,000 copies and was certified Gold by the Swedish Recording Industry Association. In Belgium, the song peaked at No. 8 in Flanders and No. 5 in Wallonia. \"Ain't It Funny\" debuted and peaked at No. 25 in Australia on September 2, 2001. \"Ain't It Funny\" peaked at No. 9 in Norway, and Ireland for the week ending August 9, 2001. The single debuted at No. 14 in Switzerland on July 29, 2001, and peaked at No. 9 three weeks later. It had a successful chart run in Switzerland, remaining on the Swiss Singles Chart for a total of twenty-six weeks. In Spain, \"Ain't It Funny\" peaked at No. 10 for the week ending July 28, 2001. Additionally, it reached the top twenty in Germany, Austria, Denmark, Hungary and Italy.\nFrom September 22\u201323, 2001, Lopez performed a set of two concerts in Puerto Rico, entitled Let's Get Loud. These served as the first concerts of her career, in which she was \"flanked by a 10-piece orchestra, a five-person choir and 11 dancers.\" \"Ain't It Funny\", among other songs, was included on the concerts' set"

Then (2002). It was written by Lopez, Troy Oliver, Cory Rooney, Mr. Deyo and Jesse Weaver Jr. and produced by Oliver and Rooney. It was released as the album's third single on April 8, 2003.\nLopez's third studio album This Is Me... Then was released in November 2002. It featured the entertainer in a more \"hands-on role\" than ever before, writing more material. Her fianc\u00e9 at the time, actor Ben Affleck, was her muse and inspiration for the album's lyrics; the title referred to \"who you are at the time\", and it was something Lopez wanted to look back on in the future. Affleck and Lopez became a prominent supercouple in popular culture, referred to as \"Bennifer\" by the public. \"Jenny from the Block\" was released as the album's lead single, peaking at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100, while its second single \"All I Have\", topped the Hot 100. However, Lopez was initially dissatisfied with the release of both singles. She felt that the tracks were too similar to her previous singles such as \"Ain't It Funny\" and \"I'm Real\"; she felt like she was \"visiting old territory\". She subsequently released \"I'm Glad\" as the album's third single, with it being serviced to Top 40 radio on April 8, 2003. The song was issued in the United Kingdom on June 9, 2003, across three formats: a CD single, and DVD single, and a cassette single. In Australia, a CD single was distributed on June 23, 2003.\n\"I'm Glad\" is an uptempo R&B ballad which runs for a duration of three minutes and forty-two seconds. Lopez wrote the song with the assistance of Troy Oliver, Cory Rooney, Andre Deyo and Schooly D, with Oliver and Rooney serving as producers. She recorded her vocals for the track with Peter Wade Keusch and Bruce Swedien at The Hit Factory recording studios in New York City, where it was also mixed. \"I'm Glad\" contains a sample of the 1986 Schooly D song \"P.S.K. What Does It Mean?\". Its instrumentation consists of classical harp runs laced throughout a computer-generated beat. Written in the key of Db Major, Lopez's vocal spans from an A\u2083 to a C\u2085. Its instrumentation includes the use of piano and guitar. \"I'm Glad\" is about finding true love, containing lyrics such as \"I think I'm in love. Damn, finally\". The Boston Globe noted the song's lyrics to be about her relationship with actor Ben Affleck, who served as Lopez's muse for This Is Me... Then.\nSteven Morse of The Boston Globe praised the song, describing it as \"elegantly\" structured. The song was nominated for \"Choice Love Song\" at the 2003 Teen Choice Awards. \"I'm Glad\" entered the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 64, on the issue date May 3, 2003. In its fourth week on the chart, the song climbed to its peak position of number 32, making it her lowest-charting single since \"Feelin' So Good\" (2000). However, it was more successful on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, peaking at number four on the issue date July 12, 2003. The song made its peak at 11 in the UK Official Charts Company for 14 good weeks.  \"I'm Glad\" debuted and peaked at number eight in Canada, becoming her eighth top-ten hit. It also entered the Australian Singles Chart at number ten, its peak position, and was later certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\n\nThe music video for \"I'm Glad\" was filmed in February 2003. While coming up with ideas for the video, Lopez's sole vision was to dance solo, without back-up dancers or assistance. She hired David LaChapelle to direct, and he then came up with the idea to recreate the film Flashdance (1983). LaChapelle identically fashioned the \"sets, iconography, and costuming\" of Flashdance as a back-drop for Lopez to dance. For the music video, Lopez sported her natural curly hair, leotards and \"tiny pants\". She spent several hours at night perfecting the music video, taking part in the editing process herself.\nDuring the music video's editing stages, Lopez wanted to make sure everything was authentic. She said, \"I really worked out and did the diet thing... and then after the video...there's always that one guy who's like 'We should retouch this'. I was like, 'You're going to leave everything the way it is. That's how it wiggles and jiggles in real life, that's how they're going to see it in the video. And I noticed\u2014[the editors] sent [the video] to me and they have shaved off a little bit of my hips and\u2014I was like, 'That ain't me\u2014those are not my hips.

It was released through Polydor Records on 14 November 2014 as the lead single from their seventh studio album, III (2014). The song was written by Take That, Jamie Norton, and Ben Mark and produced by Greg Kurstin.\n\"These Days\" was the first song to feature Take That as a trio following the departures of Jason Orange and Robbie Williams, and features all three members singing joint lead vocal. The song debuted at number one in the United Kingdom, becoming the group's 12th UK number one.\nIt became known early into the writing process that Jason Orange was unsure whether he would rejoin the band for the new single and album. Gary Barlow admitted that the band had \"known for a while that Jay [Jason Orange] was like, 'I don't know if I'm doing this or not'\" As time went on, Mark Owen stated that \"we hit the point where we could do nothing else\", and began writing music with Orange's blessing. The band then went to Los Angeles in May 2014 and locked themselves in a room \"for two or three weeks and started to play with sounds\" resulting in a much more upbeat energetic song which later became \"These Days\". Take That later played the song to Orange, who \"loved it\".\nThe single received positive reviews upon its first airplay, with Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph calling it 'uplifting' and a 'fun and fuzzy comeback'. He concluded stating \"There is enough hook-laden chutzpah about this comeback to suggest these unlikely survivors of British pop are about to triumph again. If you didn't actually know someone had left the band, you would never guess from listening to 'These Days', although there might just be a message to the deserter in the opening line: \"I can see the future coming to you crying with a sadness in your eyes\".\nThe Independent called 'These Days' \"an upbeat and energetic dance track with the carpe diem theme rolled out by many an artist: \u201cTonight we gotta live for/ We gotta live for these days/ Tonight, tonight, we'll remember/ We'll remember these days.\u201d There is also perhaps a sense of nostalgia in the song, as the originally five-strong band sings: \u201cTake me back/ To where it all began.\u201d They conclude that \"the lyrics also express a desire to rejuvenate the sound of their heady Nineties heyday. All three - Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen - share vocal duties on the song, a nod to the sound that defined their early years  and out-and-out feel-good pop\u201d. Clickmusic described the single as \"just as forward-thinking as anything on their last [album], but it's also full of nostalgia for Take That of the 1990s. Among the rippling pop melody and sprawling chorus, this is as much about their past as it is about their future. It's a nod to what they had before and it's full of hope for what lies ahead for them as a trio. As it stands, it's also one of their very best singles.\"\n\"These Days\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, knocking Band Aid 30 off the top spot. It became Take That's 12th UK number-one single and their first since the departure of Orange. It also made them the first band in United Kingdom history to have had a number-one single as a five-piece, four-piece and three-piece. The following week, \"These Days\" sold a further 44,055 copies, bringing the total of sales after two weeks to 108,053. The following week, it sold 46,102 copies, bring the total beyond 150,000 sales in three weeks. The week after the single sold a further 39,565 copies in the United Kingdom. The next week the single sold 44,899 copies, subsequently being certified Silver by the BPI with sales totalling 238,619 After a further 3 weeks within the UK top 30, the single achieved sales in the UK of 301,187. As of February 2015, the single has sold 351,507 copies in the UK alone. In May 2015, the single was certified Gold for sales of over 400,000 in the UK.\nThe video for \"These Days\" was based on a concept from Mark Owen which they shot through until the early hours of two days. The music video begins with Take That in bed together before they wake up and get ready for the day ahead. The video shows the band getting spray tanned (a homage to Jason Orange), getting perm haircuts and performing in an empty church while the congregation dance around them. The video is described by Owen as fun and tongue-in-cheek. A source close to the boys said: \"It was a three day shoot put into two days so they worked really hard. It was a bonus they didn't have to dress up too much and could stay in the clothes they wore to sleep in!\"\nTake That"

It was released on 22 July 2013 by Syco as the lead single from the group's third studio album, Midnight Memories. The song was written and composed by Wayne Hector, Ed Drewett, Matt Rad, along with the band's regular collaborators Julian Bunetta and John Ryan.\n\"Best Song Ever\" debuted and peaked at number two on both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100, making it their highest-charting single in the United States to date.\nThe song is written in the key of C-sharp major with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It follows a chord progression of F\u266f-C\u266f-G\u266f.\nWill Hermes from Rolling Stone gave \"Best Song Ever\" a score of 4 out of 5 stars, describing the track as \"pretty irresistible\". Lewis Corner at Digital Spy also awarded the song 4 out of 5 stars, writing: \"Sure the lyrics are cheesier than a 6-pack of Wotsits, and yes the sentiment is cornier than a Disney Channel rom-com, but as far as boyband pop anthems go it skirts dangerously close to fulfilling its title.\"\nIn the course of a debate on Twitter, it was alleged that the song was a rip off of \"Baba O'Riley\" by The Who, which angered One Direction's fans. The Who guitarist Pete Townshend responded to the claims by denying that The Who were pursuing legal action, and stated that he was a fan of One Direction's single and was happy that One Direction appeared to have been influenced by The Who, just as he had been by his own guitar heroes such as Eddie Cochran.\nThe music video for \"Best Song Ever\" was directed by Ben Winston and written by comedian James Corden. Filmed over two days at The Temple House in Miami Beach, Florida, the video was released on the band's Vevo channel on 22 July 2013.\nThe video is over six minutes long and features the band arguing with clueless studio executives in a battle over their new image. Niall Horan plays studio executive Harvey (Harvey Weinstein), Louis Tomlinson plays studio executive Jonny (modelled after Tom Cruise's character Les Grossman in the movie Tropic Thunder), and Zayn Malik plays \"The Sexy Assistant\", Veronica. The studio executives are stoked to take the band to the proverbial next level, but they proceed to bring in an under-qualified crew consisting of Marcel, \"The Marketing Guy\" (Harry Styles) and Leeroy, \"The Choreographer\" (Liam Payne). Interspersed with scenes from their film One Direction: This is Us, the band are shown wreaking havoc throughout the office and even throwing in a few dance moves for good measure.\nThe music video won a British Video at the 2014 Brit Awards on 19 February 2014.\nThe video broke the Vevo 24-hour record with 12.3 million views, surpassing the 10.7 million views of Miley Cyrus' \"We Can't Stop\" in June, although the record was later broken again by Cyrus' follow-up music video \"Wrecking Ball\", which garnered 19.3 million views.\nThe group performed \"Best Song Ever\" live for the first time on 30 July 2013 at the SAP center in San Jose, California during their Take Me Home Tour concert until their final live at Japan. The song was subsequently added to the set-list to all proceeding shows of the American leg. The group's first televised performance of the single was at the 2013 Teen Choice Awards on 11 August. The group also performed the song, along with some of their other hits, on The Today Show on 23 August, on America's Got Talent on 28 August, and again on The X Factor Australia on 27 October. On 15 November, the group performed \"Best Song Ever\" for the first time on British television at Children in Need 2013.

The dance-pop song peaked at number four in Germany and at number nine on the UK Singles Chart, while it reached number 59 on the US Billboard Hot 100. An accompanying music video was directed by Austrian film director Stefan Ruzowitzky, and depicts NSYNC  dancing inside a warehouse.\nThe song was originally pitched to the Backstreet Boys but was eventually given to NSYNC to record. It was co-written by Max Martin and Kristian Lundin in a three day period after their debut single \"I Want You Back\" started appearing on several charts in Europe. Their then-label BMG Ariola, wanted the next single to be similar but catered towards an American audience. On the day of recording \"Tearin' Up My Heart\", Lundin overslept because he recorded a previous track and slept at 7 a.m. NSYNC arrived in Stockholm the previous night to record the song for one day since they were scheduled to be in Germany the next morning. JC Chasez was the last member to perform the final takes in the studio while the other members were at the airport, as they recorded throughout the night until 6 a.m. NSYNC were excited to record the song, with Chasez stating that it would help with the band's concerts because they could start and end the show with \"two hit songs\". \"Tearin' Up My Heart\" is a dance-pop song.\nIn 2007, VH1 listed \"Tearin' Up My Heart\" as the 30th greatest song of the 1990s. In Billboard's ranking of \"The 100 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time\", the song was ranked as number five, stating that although it was similar to \"I Want You Back\", the song's \"higher energy and sharper hook\" was made \"more awe-inspiring\" than the former. In addition, they wrote that \"the harmonies provided by the rest of the group on the chorus make it about as quintessential as boy band songs come, with the rolling pop melody and funky pre-verse breakdown helping it really soar\".\nThe song has reached the top 10 in several countries, including number three in Canada, number four in Germany and Austria, number six in Sweden, and number nine in the UK. It has also charted in top 20 in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.\nIn the US, \"Tearin' Up My Heart\" charted at number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reached the top 10 on the Mainstream Top 40.\nIt has since been certified Silver in the UK.\n\nThe music video was directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky, and was filmed in Florida. It depicts NSYNC dancing inside a warehouse, playing basketball, and taking photos using a Polaroid camera. They additionally participate in a photo shoot, perform acrobatics, eat pizza, and are sprawled next to grayscale photographs. Chasez is seen performing with a guitar. Each member wears matching black and white outfits. The music video was released in Europe in February 1997, and eventually aired in the US on the debut episode of Total Request Live on September 14, 1998.\nThe video begins with several flash cuts of Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez posing in front of the camera. The remaining members join in as they perform several choreographed sequences, which constantly transition from the group wearing urban clothing and white tank tops and jackets. The first verse begins with Chasez sitting on a gym bench, while Chris Kirkpatrick is practicing on a punching bag. Both are then seen leaning on the rafters, as Timberlake is choosing clothes off a clothes rack. The group are then playing a basketball game, as they prepare for a photoshoot in front of a white backdrop. The chorus begins with the group, wearing white shirts and black pants, performing choreographed dance moves as the photographer takes various flash photos. Several members then perform stunts, such as backflips, midair splits and various parkour jumps.\nTimberlake's verse begins with the group lying on the floor covered with instant photographs, then taking selfies while eating pizza on the couch. The next scene transitions to Timberlake lying on a bed, as he stretches his arms out. The group continue to perform their choreography during the chorus, however each member individually dances in front of the camera.

Bernardo and their producers Mattman & Robin. It was released by Kidinakorner and Interscope Records on July 17, 2018, serving as the lead single from the band's fourth studio album, Origins (2018), as well as the seasonal anthem of the 2018 ESPN College Football. It became their fifth number one song on the US Hot Rock Songs chart.\nLead singer Dan Reynolds noted that \"Natural\" is about \"finding yourself and being willing and able to stand up to whatever adversity comes your way\". He said in a press release announcing the song: \"Living in a dog-eat-dog world can bring out the worst in you, and sometimes, the best. It would be a lie to tell you I haven't become somewhat skeptical about some things in the last decade of my life. However, I believe that when you truly learn to love yourself, the judging eyes and hateful words become meaningless.\"\nThe song was chosen by ESPN as the anthem of the 2018 College Football season. It is the second time that an Imagine Dragons song was chosen, the first being \"Roots\" in 2015. \"'Natural' embodies the energy, spirit and drama of each team's journey to the College Football Playoff, and that is why it was chosen as this year's anthem,\" said Emeka Ofodile, ESPN vice president of sports marketing. It is also part of the soundtrack for EA Sports' NHL 19.\n\"Natural\" is a pop rock song which features a \"mix of explosive drums and inspiring lyrics\", with \"stadium-rocking instrumentation\" over the chorus.\nMarkos Papadatos of Digital Journal regarded \"Natural\" as a \"well-crafted and well-produced song\", writing that \"Reynolds' voice is impressive, raw and powerful\", and that the song \"garners two thumbs up\". Sam Tornow of Billboard described the song as \"ferocious\" and \"smash-mouth\". Mike Wass of Idolator named the song a \"radio-ready anthem\", expecting it to be \"another smash\" following the success of the band's third studio album Evolve (2017). Tiana Timmerberg of Radio.com called the song \"energetic and inspiring\", deeming it \"a feel-good jam with positive and empowering lyrics\".\nA music video for the song was released on August 24, 2018. It depicts frontman Dan Reynolds as the apparent owner of a spooky house including shots of a woman in a bathtub, the same woman being pursued by other inhabitants of the house and an abnormally tall man resembling Slenderman, a supposed funeral for the woman, Wayne Sermon, Ben McKee and Daniel Platzman fading into dust, Reynolds digging a grave and burying the woman alive, and other shots no the house and its inhabitants, along with a clip of a lion mauling a zebra.\nIts music video has received over 410 million views and 4 million likes as of March 2021.\nOn July 19, 2018, Imagine Dragons made a live television debut of the single on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The performance featured a guitar solo by lead guitarist Wayne Sermon that expanded on the studio recording.\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nMattman & Robin \u2013 production, engineering\nSerban Ghenea \u2013 mixing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaherty, Kevin (July 17, 2018). \"ESPN picks pump-up song for the 2018 college football season\". 247Sports.

It was released on 22 July 2013 by Syco as the lead single from the group's third studio album, Midnight Memories. The song was written and composed by Wayne Hector, Ed Drewett, Matt Rad, along with the band's regular collaborators Julian Bunetta and John Ryan.\n\"Best Song Ever\" debuted and peaked at number two on both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100, making it their highest-charting single in the United States to date.\nThe song is written in the key of C-sharp major with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It follows a chord progression of F\u266f-C\u266f-G\u266f.\nWill Hermes from Rolling Stone gave \"Best Song Ever\" a score of 4 out of 5 stars, describing the track as \"pretty irresistible\". Lewis Corner at Digital Spy also awarded the song 4 out of 5 stars, writing: \"Sure the lyrics are cheesier than a 6-pack of Wotsits, and yes the sentiment is cornier than a Disney Channel rom-com, but as far as boyband pop anthems go it skirts dangerously close to fulfilling its title.\"\nIn the course of a debate on Twitter, it was alleged that the song was a rip off of \"Baba O'Riley\" by The Who, which angered One Direction's fans. The Who guitarist Pete Townshend responded to the claims by denying that The Who were pursuing legal action, and stated that he was a fan of One Direction's single and was happy that One Direction appeared to have been influenced by The Who, just as he had been by his own guitar heroes such as Eddie Cochran.\nThe music video for \"Best Song Ever\" was directed by Ben Winston and written by comedian James Corden. Filmed over two days at The Temple House in Miami Beach, Florida, the video was released on the band's Vevo channel on 22 July 2013.\nThe video is over six minutes long and features the band arguing with clueless studio executives in a battle over their new image. Niall Horan plays studio executive Harvey (Harvey Weinstein), Louis Tomlinson plays studio executive Jonny (modelled after Tom Cruise's character Les Grossman in the movie Tropic Thunder), and Zayn Malik plays \"The Sexy Assistant\", Veronica. The studio executives are stoked to take the band to the proverbial next level, but they proceed to bring in an under-qualified crew consisting of Marcel, \"The Marketing Guy\" (Harry Styles) and Leeroy, \"The Choreographer\" (Liam Payne). Interspersed with scenes from their film One Direction: This is Us, the band are shown wreaking havoc throughout the office and even throwing in a few dance moves for good measure.\nThe music video won a British Video at the 2014 Brit Awards on 19 February 2014.\nThe video broke the Vevo 24-hour record with 12.3 million views, surpassing the 10.7 million views of Miley Cyrus' \"We Can't Stop\" in June, although the record was later broken again by Cyrus' follow-up music video \"Wrecking Ball\", which garnered 19.3 million views.\nThe group performed \"Best Song Ever\" live for the first time on 30 July 2013 at the SAP center in San Jose, California during their Take Me Home Tour concert until their final live at Japan. The song was subsequently added to the set-list to all proceeding shows of the American leg. The group's first televised performance of the single was at the 2013 Teen Choice Awards on 11 August. The group also performed the song, along with some of their other hits, on The Today Show on 23 August, on America's Got Talent on 28 August, and again on The X Factor Australia on 27 October. On 15 November, the group performed \"Best Song Ever\" for the first time on British television at Children in Need 2013. Since its release, the song closed out all concerts for the 2014 Where We Are Tour and the 2015 On the Road Again Tour.\nMusicians such as Gabrielle Aplin and The Vamps have covered \"Best Song Ever\". \"Weird Al\" Yankovic also covered the song as part of his polka medley \"NOW That's What I Call Polka!\" for his 2014 album Mandatory Fun.

(2015). The song was released worldwide on 31 July 2015 and was the band's first single since Zayn Malik's departure earlier that same year. \"Drag Me Down\" debuted atop the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Austria, Australia, and New Zealand. It became the group's first number one single in France and Australia, as well as their fourth number one in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and won the fan-voted 'Best Video Award' at the 2016 Brit Awards.\n\"Drag Me Down\" is marked as One Direction's first single since Zayn Malik's departure in March 2015. The announcement of the release, with no previous promotion or marketing, was done by Liam Payne on his Twitter handle, followed by the rest of the members on 31 July 2015.\n\"Drag Me Down\" is a midtempo pop rock track written by Jamie Scott, Julian Bunetta and John Ryan, who wrote and produced several songs on One Direction's previous two albums Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014). According to Los Angeles Times's editor Mikael Wood, the production contains springy guitars that recall The Police or \"Rude\" by Magic!. The song is written in C minor with a tempo of 138 beats per minute.\nJason Lipshutz of Billboard gave the song three and a half out of five stars and stated that the song offers a more \"mature sound\". He also commented \"for those worried that a four-member incarnation of the group can't get the job done, \"Drag Me Down\" assuages those fears by keeping the overall quality level high\" and \"the group compensates for Malik\u2019s absence by giving each member ample time to shine, and the harmonies admirably resonate on the call-and-response portions of the pre-chorus\". Writing for Idolater, Robbie Daw commented that the song \"comes across perhaps like the first One Direction song that might appeal to an audience outside of the band\u2019s screaming core fan base\".\nGaby Hernandez of Rolling Stone described the song as a \"pop-rock track shifts the band\u2019s sound from the softer folk of their last album, Four, back to the more upbeat, electronic heavy elements of their first two albums\". Jamieson Cox of The Verge called the song \"a slight departure from the music the band was making with Malik in tow\" while commenting that \"there's a bit of The Police in the loping, reggae-lite bass line and guitar riffs, and the song's structure is cribbed from the last few years' finest EDM-pop crossovers\" and that \"when you fold in the melody, the whole package reminds me of Taylor Swift's \"I Knew You Were Trouble,\" and that qualifies as praise in this space\". Noelle Devoe, writing for The Daily Telegraph, described the song as \"rocking an even edgier, mature sound\" and \"a love song to their fans\" while commenting on Styles' high notes. The Herald wrote that \"in true One Direction style, Drag Me Down is a catchy love song with a poppy beat\". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars, and stated that \"Drag Me Down\" is \"one of their most pop-centric releases to date\" and that \"they may have taken a hit with the exit of Zayn, but One Direction are far from down and out\".\nMikael Wood with the Los Angeles Times gave a more negative review, stating that the song is \"all too accurately titled\" and that it is \"decidedly smaller-scaled\" and \"carries no such charge\" compared to the band's previous songs. He added \"we\u2019re basically talking about a midtempo pop-rock jam with springy guitars that recall The Police\" and the song is \"more or less what you\u2019d expect from a band of four good-looking white guys\".\nPast member Zayn Malik took to social media and praised the single, describing it as \"sick\" and stating that \"he was proud of his boys.\"\nThe video for \"Drag Me Down\" was directed by Ben and Gabe Turner and filmed at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas and premiered on Vevo on 31 July 2015. The video includes the band being put through their paces as though they are astronauts preparing for a space mission. It won the fan-voted 'Best Video Award' at the 2016 Brit Awards and as of 10 July 2021, it has been viewed about 960 million times on YouTube.\nIn Fall 2015, the Big Payno Remix was released which features American rapper Lunchmoney Lewis which appears on their Perfect EP.\nOne Direction gave their first performance of the song on their On the Road Again Tour in Indianapolis on 31 July 2015 until the end of their concert tour.

It was released as the second single from their fourth studio album, Eyes Open (2006). It was recorded in 2005 and released on 6 June 2006 in the United States and 24 July 2006 in the United Kingdom. The song gained significant popularity in the US after being featured in the second season finale of the popular medical drama Grey's Anatomy, which aired on 15 May 2006.\n\"Chasing Cars\" became notable as one of the songs that revealed the impact of legal downloads on single sales in the UK, selling consistently for years after its release. The song is Snow Patrol's biggest-selling single to date, ending 2006 as that year's 14th best-selling single in the UK and that year had the distinction of being the last song performed live on the BBC's Top of the Pops. Released in the post-Britpop period, the song peaked at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 5 on the US Billboard Hot 100.\nAt the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in 2007, \"Chasing Cars\" was nominated for Best Rock Song, and at the 2007 Brit Awards it was nominated for Best British Single. As of 2019, the song has spent 111 weeks in the official UK top 75, 166 in the top 100 and had sold over one million copies in the UK by October 2013. It has also sold 3,900,000 copies in the US by January 2015, making it one of the top best-selling rock songs in the digital era. In 2009, UK music licensing body PPL announced that \"Chasing Cars\" was the most widely played song of the decade in the UK. Ten years later, it was revealed as the most-played song of the 21st century on UK radio.\nLead singer Gary Lightbody reportedly wrote the song when he became sober after a binge of white wine, in the garden of song producer Jacknife Lee's Kent cottage. The song has Lightbody singing a plain melody over sparse guitars, which has an ever-building crescendo. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he said \"It's the purest love song that I've ever written. There's no knife-in-the-back twist. When I read these lyrics back, I was like, 'Oh, that's weird.' All the other love songs I've written have a dark edge.\" The phrase \"Chasing Cars\" came from Lightbody's father, in reference to a girl Lightbody was infatuated with, \"You're like a dog chasing a car. You'll never catch it and you just wouldn't know what to do with it if you did.\"\nSnow Patrol played \"Chasing Cars\" on an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. The song was also performed as the last live performance on long-running music programme Top of the Pops. The band also performed the song when they were the musical guest on 17 March 2007 episode of Saturday Night Live, hosted by Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Additionally, the band played the song live in their appearance at Live Earth; on 7 July 2007, this song was performed during the London leg of the Live Earth concert at Wembley Stadium and at Oxegen later on that night in Ireland.\n\"Chasing Cars\" was heard on the TV show One Tree Hill's third-season finale episode, \"The Show Must Go On\", which aired in the US on 3 May 2006. Several weeks later, the song appeared on the second-season finale of Grey's Anatomy on 15 May 2006, and the song found a larger listening audience and pushed its way onto the download and pop charts in the United States. The song was made into a music video for the show, serving as a promotion for its third season. The music video shows scenes from the first and second seasons as well as previously unseen scenes from the third season, with clips in-between from the UK music video of the song. It was heard again in the eighteenth episode of the show's seventh season on 31 March 2011, along with the cast's cover of Brandi Carlile's \"The Story\" and The Fray's \"How to Save a Life\". In the UK, it was also used in the 'Best Bits' montage on the live final of the seventh series of Big Brother on 18 August 2006.\nTwo music videos were made: one for the UK and one for the US.\nIn the UK music video, Gary Lightbody lies on the open ground as cameras film him from different angles. It starts raining, splashing his face and hands. Lightbody enters a pool of water next to him and, at the end of the video, he gets out of the water, rises to his feet and looks up at the camera as it zooms out overhead.\nIn the US version, Lightbody is shown lying down in busy places while singing. People ignore and step over him. Among the places he lies are a diner (he sits at a table"

The song is one of the band's most popular airplay songs and peaked in the top 3 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. It became the joint seventh longest charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, tying with Santana's \"Smooth\" (1999), at 58 consecutive weeks. The song has been certified 3x Platinum by the RIAA, and has sold 4.7 million downloads as of January 2015, the fourth best-selling rock song in digital history.\nIt is the band's highest-charting song to date, topping the Adult Top 40 chart for 15 consecutive weeks and topping the Canadian Airplay Chart. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 2007, but lost to \"Dani California\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers.\nAccording to lead singer Isaac Slade, the song was composed and influenced by his experience while working as a mentor at a camp for troubled teenagers:\nOne of the youngsters I was paired up with was a musician. Here I was, a protected suburbanite, and he was just 17 and had all these problems. And no one could write a manual on how to save him.\nSlade claims that the song is about all of the people that tried to reach out to the boy but were unsuccessful. As Slade says in an interview, the boy's friends and family approached him by saying, \"Quit taking drugs and cutting yourself or I won't talk to you again,\" but all he needed was some support. The boy was losing friends and going through depression. He lost his best friend and could not deal with it. The verses of the song describe an attempt by an adult to confront a troubled teen. In the chorus, the singer laments that he himself was unable to save a friend because he did not know how.\nWhile this was the original intent of the song, the band has opened the song to interpretation. They created a website where fans were welcome to submit music videos they had made for the song. This arose from the response that Slade got from the song:\nI got a lot of e-mails about it (...) One boy died in a car accident, and I guess it had been the last song he downloaded from his computer. They played it at his funeral, and some of his friends got Save a life tattooed on their arms. The response has been overwhelming.\nDuring an interview in Sauce, Bob Wilson asked Slade, \"'How to Save a Life' was apparently inspired by an experience you had as a mentor to a boy who had a drug problem. What's the story behind that?\" Slade answered:\nWell there's a group home here in Denver called Shelterwood, and it takes in teens who've had a tough time; their parents don't want to send them to jail, but they can't keep track of them themselves... A friend of mine was actually the president for that particular school, so he asked Joe and I to come up for one of their weekend retreats... I was paired up with one boy in particular. His story was just amazing \u2013 all the relationships that he had put at risk because of the decisions he made, and eventually losing the relationships... the cost of his lifestyle and his choices, and kind of relating them to my own life and my own stories; seeing all the relationships I've threatened for one reason or another. It was a really inspiring weekend.\nThe song is the band's first to achieve significant popularity outside of the United States. \"How to Save a Life\" was a top five hit in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. \nDue to an early leak by BBC Radio 1 in the United Kingdom, where it was the band's debut single, the song was released in the territory five weeks earlier than planned. It debuted at number twenty nine on the UK Singles Chart on January 21, 2007, via downloads alone. Instead of its planned release date which was to be March 26, 2007, the single was physically released in the United Kingdom on February 28 and gradually rose up the chart, reaching number five on February 25, staying there for four weeks. It eventually peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart on April 8 and became Britain's eleventh biggest-selling song of 2007. On March 29, \"How to Save a Life\" peaked at number 1 in Ireland, becoming their first and only number one single in the country to date. The song only stayed at the top spot for a week but sales still proved strong after it fell from number 1.\nThe song was ranked No. 24 on Billboard's Best Adult Pop Songs of the Decade, and No. 47 on Billboard's Top 100 Digital Tracks of the Decade.

The song is a commentary and plea that criticises the then-dominant Cold War foreign policy and doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD) by the United States and the then existing Soviet Union.\nIn 2010, Sting explained that the song was inspired by watching Soviet TV via inventor Ken Schaffer's satellite receiver at Columbia University:  \n\"I had a friend at university who invented a way to steal the satellite signal from Russian TV. We'd have a few beers and climb this tiny staircase to watch Russian television... At that time of night we'd only get children's Russian television, like their 'Sesame Street'. I was impressed with the care and attention they gave to their children's programmes. I regret our current enemies haven't got the same ethics.\"\nSting performed the song at the 1986 Grammy Awards.  His performance of the song was released on the 1994 album Grammy's Greatest Moments Volume I.\nThe accompanying music video for the single was directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, and was shot in a similar black-and-white, French New Wave-influenced style to his previous video for Don Henley's \"The Boys Of Summer\". The video also prominently featured child actor Felix Howard, who was later featured Mondino's promotional video for Madonna's \"Open Your Heart\" in 1986.\nThe song uses the Romance theme from the Lieutenant Kij\u00e9 Suite by Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev, and its lead-in includes a snippet from the Soviet news program Vremya in which the famed Soviet news broadcaster Igor Kirillov says in Russian: \"...The British Prime Minister described the talks with the head of the delegation, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, as a constructive, realistic, practical and friendly exchange of opinions...\", referring to the meeting of Mikhail Gorbachev and Margaret Thatcher in 1984. The Soviet leader at the time was Konstantin Chernenko.\nAlso in the background, communications from the Apollo\u2013Soyuz mission can be heard.\nIn a 2021 interview, James Cameron, the co-writer, director and producer of Terminator 2, said that the song inspired him to create the character of John Connor, the 10-year-old boy who would be the central character of the plot: \"I remember sitting there once, high on E, writing notes for Terminator, and I was struck by Sting\u2019s song, that \u201cI hope the Russians love their children too.\u201d And I thought, \u201cYou know what?

It was a number-one Billboard Hot 100 hit for two weeks in the summer of 1989. An edited version of the song is included in the imported version of the album Toy Soldiers: The Best of Martika.\nMartika wrote the song about a friend who was battling a cocaine addiction. \"I was a little hesitant because I had only written two songs before and they were light songs. I came up to Michael and said I wanted to write about drugs. It was the first time I got the nerve to write about something that was scary for me to talk about, so I did.\" According to an episode of VH-1's Pop-Up Video, in which \"Toy Soldiers\" was featured, the friend-in-question eventually conquered the addiction.\nThe song is performed in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 65 beats per minute in  time.  The song follows a chord progression of A\u2013B\u2013A\u2013B\u2013C\u266fm\u2013B\u2013C\u266fm\u2013G\u266fm\u2013C\u266fm\u2013B.\nBryan Buss of AllMusic retrospectively reviewed the Martika album, stating \"the big hit single, 'Toy Soldiers', works with its childlike vocals and lyrics, creating a haunting, effective dichotomy with its subject of drug addiction.\" Buss also highlighted the song as an album standout by labeling it an AMG Pick Track. Rob Theakston of Allmusic labeled the song as an AMG Pick Track on the 2005 compilation Toy Soldiers: The Best of Martika.\nThe song spent two weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. and New Zealand while reaching number five in both the United Kingdom and Australia. On Billboard's year-end chart for 1989, \"Toy Soldiers\" placed number 29. It was Martika's only number-one single in the U.S., and her highest-ranking single in the United Kingdom. The single was certified Gold in the United States by the RIAA.\nIn March and April 2009, VH1 ran a countdown of the 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s. \"Toy Soldiers\" placed at number 67 on the countdown, although Martika had three other top 40 hits: \"More Than You Know\" (number 18); \"I Feel the Earth Move\" (number 25); and \"Love... Thy Will Be Done\" (number 10).\nThe video for the song was directed by Jim Shea, who later became a regular in directing country music videos. Martika is seen singing with a waterfall in front of her (this was done by filming her in an empty pool with a water current flowing between her and the camera).\nMartika is the lead singer throughout the song and is joined on the chorus by some of her former castmates from Kids Incorporated: Stacy Ferguson (Fergie), Rahsaan Patterson, and Renee Sands, as well as later cast members Kimberly McCullough and Devyn Puett as backup vocalists (\"The Toy Soldiers\").\n7-inch single\n\"Toy Soldiers\" \u2013 4:52\n\"Exchange of Hearts\" \u2013 4:15\n3-inch single\n\"Toy Soldiers\" \u2013 4:52\n\"Exchange of Hearts\" \u2013 4:15\n\"It's Not What You're Doing\" \u2013 4:11\n12-inch single\n\"Toy Soldiers\" \u2013 4:52\n\"It's Not What You're Doing\" \u2013 4:11\n\"Exchange of Hearts\" \u2013 4:15\n\n\n\n\nMartika recorded and produced a Spanish version of \"Toy Soldiers\" renaming it \"Como Un Juguete\", though it was not as successful as the original English version.

Released as a single in 1994, the song was a hit in many countries, particularly in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, and Norway, where it topped the singles charts. In the United States, the single peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100.\nThe song received acclaim and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song and four Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rock Song, Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo, and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television. In 2004, it finished at number 68 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.\nThe song is listed among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\nIn early 1993, Philadelphia director Jonathan Demme asked Springsteen to write a song for his film, adding \"I want it to play in the malls.\" Springsteen replied, \"Well, I'm interested, so I'd like to come up with a song for you. If you give me some time, I'll see, but I can't promise.\" Springsteen recalled adding, \"I'm not very good at scores\". In late August, after the conclusion of the \"Other Band\" Tour, he recorded a demo of his completed song at Thrill Hill Recording, Beverly Hills, California (his home studio), supplying all of the instrumentation. He mailed the tape to Demme, who later said, \"my wife and I sat down and listened to it, and we were literally weeping by the end\". Meanwhile, background vocals were added by Tommy Sims (from the \"Other Band\"). In October, Springsteen recorded it at A&M Studios in Los Angeles, with Sims, Ornette Coleman on saxophone, and vocals by \"Little\" Jimmy Scott. It was mixed by Bob Clearmountain, included in the soundtrack, and the video was shot. However, in mid-December, Springsteen suddenly replaced it with his home demo from August, re-shooting some video scenes to eliminate Scott. The four-man combo version can be heard in a brief scene in the film when Tom Hanks exits Denzel Washington's office, but it was Bruce alone playing over the opening credits. \"Streets of Philadelphia\" was released on February 2, 1994, as the first single from the film's original soundtrack, with Springsteen singing and playing all the instruments and Tommy Sims on background vocals, and became a chart success worldwide.\n\"Streets of Philadelphia\" achieved greater popularity in Europe than in the United States. While it peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, it became a number-one single in Germany, France and Austria. It peaked at number two in the United Kingdom, becoming Springsteen's highest charting hit in Britain, and number four in Australia. As of 2012, \"Streets of Philadelphia\" ranks as his most recent top ten hit. The song was included on the album All Time Greatest Movie Songs, released by Sony in 1999.\nLarry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"Springsteen's empathetic lyrics and performance zoom straight for the heart, traveling atop a slow\nand sturdy beat and pillowy synths. A powerful song with or without the image of the film to support it.\" Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times deemed it \"a moving ballad about a man whose body is being destroyed by AIDS\", and \"a work that shows Springsteen, despite all the questions raised by changes in his life in recent years, can still write purposeful songs that connect on a deeply emotional level.\" He added, \"Springsteen sings in a voice that expresses the helplessness and heartache of someone dying of AIDS as convincingly as Springsteen once conveyed the dreams and aspirations of youth.\" Music writer James Masterton said in his weekly UK chart commentary, \"However good it may be the brooding ballad is hardly classic Bruce and can be expected to shuttle rapidly out next week\". A reviewer from Music & Media commented, \"The man who used to walk upon E-Street, now roams the Philly lanes. This synth-dominated track from the OST Philadelphia revives the \"etherealism\" of Tunnel Of Love.\"\nThe music video for the song, directed by Jonathan Demme and his nephew Ted Demme in December 1993, begins by showing Springsteen walking along desolate city streets, followed by a bustling park and schoolyard, interspersed with footage from the film.

With that, \"With You\" became the seventh and the fourth single from Simpson in the United States and United Kingdom respectively.\nMusically, it is a mid-tempo pop song. Billy Mann and Andy Marvel produced the song and co-wrote it with Simpson. The music video for \"With You\" was directed by Elliott Lester while Simpson was in the reality show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. The video received two nominations at the MTV Video Music Award 2004 and enjoyed great commercial success.\nThe song peaked in the top ten in Australia and the United Kingdom, and at top-twenty in Ireland, Norway and the United States. The single was certified Platinum by the RIAA and Platinum in Australia.\n\"With You\" was written by Jessica Simpson, Billy Mann, and Andy Marvel, and produced by Andy Marvel and Mann. \"With You\" lasts for three minutes and twelve seconds, and is in the key of D Minor. Musically, it is a mid-tempo pop song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song contains instruments such as piano and guitar.\nAbout the idea of the song, Simpson said \"it's cool for me just because it's my personality [...] Nick loves me with nothing but a T-shirt on so that's where the song idea came from.\"\nChuck Taylor of Billboard reviewed \"With You\" favorably, saying \"It\u00b4s certainly a hitworthy candidate\" and citing \"Producers Billy Mann and Andy Marvel add a hint of funk to the mix, giving the track enough hip appeal to make the grade at today's top 40.\"\n\n\"With You\" was released largely in hopes that the song would revive In This Skin on the charts. In the United States, the song debuted at number sixty-five on the Billboard Hot 100, on the issue dated December 27, 2003. On March 20, 2004, the single reached its peak position of number fourteen and was awarded the honor of that week's Greatest Gainer Sales. The single stayed on the chart for twenty-three weeks. \"With You\" became Simpson's fourth top-forty single in the US and her second highest peak on the chart since \"I Wanna Love You Forever\" (1999). The song also peaked at number one on Billboard Pop Songs chart and was her first number one on the chart. On the Hot Digital Tracks chart, the single debuted at number twenty-three on the issue dated January 10, 2004. The song peaked at number seven on the chart with 10,000 digital download sales by February 14, 2004. Due to strong digital download sales, the single was certified Gold by RIAA for selling 500,000 copies. It was her first certification for digital sales. As the date, \"With You\" is her second best selling digital single with 1 million copies sold.\nIn Australia, the single debuted at number twenty-five on the ARIA Charts for the week of April 4, 2004. The next week reached at number seventeen. Seven weeks later, the song peaked at number four and stayed on the chart for twenty-four weeks. The single became her highest peak at the time and her first top-five in that country. Later was certified Platinum by ARIA, denoting shipments of 70,000 units within the country. In New Zealand, the song only reached at number thirty-nine on the issue of April 19, 2004.\nIn United Kingdom, the song debuted at number seven on the issue dated June 20, 2004. The single stayed on the chart for eight weeks and became her fourth top-twenty there. In Norway, the single debuted at number eleven. It descended at number thirteen the next week and stayed on the chart for six weeks. It became her third top-twenty in that country since \"Irresistible\" (2001). In Ireland, the song debuted at number eleven on the issue dated June 17, 2004. The single became her highest peak at the time there. Due to its appearance on several European charts, the song peaked at number twenty-five on the European Hot 100 Singles chart.\n\nAs the single was released while Simpson's reality show, Newlyweds, was still on air and at the peak of its popularity, the video of the song was created to parallel the show. The music video for \"With You\" was filmed in October 2003, by Elliott Lester.\nShe is featured chowing down on Chicken of the Sea tuna\u2014an allusion to the first episode, where she asks if the famous tuna brand is really chicken\u2014and buffalo wings, a reference to another gaffe of hers, when she asks if buffalo wings come from buffalo.

The song was written by Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Mark Hudson.  It was released in 1993 as the first single from the band's commercially successful album Get a Grip.  The single reached number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, number three on the Cash Box Top 100, and number one on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart, where it remained for nine weeks, making it Aerosmith's most successful single on that chart. In the UK, the song peaked at number 19 on the British pop chart in April 1993.\nAccording to the band's autobiography Walk This Way, the song was inspired by the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Steven Tyler also mentions in the book that the song features the sound of a bass drum he stole from his high school; four loud beats are heard from that drum in a pause between the final verse and chorus.\nThe music video depicts vandalism, grand theft auto, joyriding, airbag crashing, unprotected sex, violence among school-aged youth, cross-dressing teachers, a naked Steven Tyler holding a zipper by his crotch with half his body painted black (to give the effect he pulled down a zipper, unzipping his body) and lead guitarist Joe Perry playing a lead guitar solo in front of an oncoming train. The train scene was filmed on Lake Britton Bridge in Shasta County, California, the same bridge where Stand by Me filmed their famous train scene and employs the same Introvision technology. Directed by Marty Callner, the video featured actor Edward Furlong.\nReleased on YouTube on 24 December 2009, the video has received over 66 million views as of May 2021.\n\"Livin' on the Edge\" has been a staple at Aerosmith concerts ever since its release.\nDuring the Get a Grip Tour, the band performed a portion of \"She Cried\" (a song recorded by Jay and the Americans, among other artists) as the intro to \"Livin' on the Edge\". Performances often involved Tyler screaming \"There ain't no life nowhere\" (from the song \"I Don't Live Today\" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience) and then breathing heavily over a bright light during the brief interlude.\n\"Livin' on the Edge\" was performed at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards, the 36th Grammy Awards, and at Woodstock '94.\nAdditionally, the band performed the song as part of its set at the United We Stand benefit concert, held in Washington, D.C. shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\"Livin' on the Edge\" met with dismissive reactions from music critics. Reviewing Get a Grip for Rolling Stone, Mark Coleman cited \"Livin' on the Edge\" as an example of the album \"playing it safe according to strict late-Eighties directives\", and added that it \"ascends into a soaring, Bon Jovi-esque power chorale; only the gritty guitars on the bridge keep the damn thing grounded.\" David Browne of Entertainment Weekly also found the song was uncomfortably derivative of Bon Jovi, remarking that it \"might have worked better if it didn\u2019t sound like Bon Jovi trying hard to sound like Aerosmith.\" Both Browne and Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the song's lyrics as a halfhearted, ineffectual attempt at social commentary.\nThe song won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal for the year 1993. The video for the song earned the band a Viewer's Choice award at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards. The video was also voted \"Best Video\" by Metal Edge readers in the magazine's 1993 Readers' Choice Awards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitburn, Joel (2004).

It was released by Wind-up Records on December 8, 2003, as the third single from the album. An alternative version appears on the band's fourth studio album Synthesis (2017). The song was written by guitarist Ben Moody, lead singer Amy Lee and keyboardist David Hodges, and it was produced by Moody and Dave Fortman. Various versions of \"My Immortal\" were recorded; one of them was included on the demo album Origin (2000) and another on the EP release Mystary (2003). The version originally appearing on Origin was later included on Fallen, featuring piano with backing strings. The version of the song released as a single was dubbed the \"band version\" because of the complete band's performance of the bridge and final chorus of the song.\n\"My Immortal\" is a piano power ballad with a slow tempo. Lyrically, it talks about \"a spirit staying with you after its death and haunting you until you actually wish that the spirit were gone because it won't leave you alone.\" Critical reception towards the song was positive, with critics complimenting its piano melody. In 2005, it received a nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 47th Grammy Awards. The song was also commercially successful, peaking within the top ten in more than ten countries. It charted at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, Greece and Portugal, as well as on the Billboard Adult Pop Songs chart. The single was certified gold in the United States and platinum in Australia.\nAn accompanying music video directed by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Gothic Quarter, Barcelona, on October 10, 2003. The video shows Lee sitting and singing on various locations but never touching the ground. Shots of Moody are also shown but he is never together with his band or Lee. The video was nominated in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was performed by the band during their three concert tours: the Fallen Tour (2003), The Open Door Tour (2007) and the Evanescence Tour (2011\u201312). It was also performed live during some of their television appearances and award ceremonies such as the Billboard Music Awards.\nThe song was written by Ben Moody and Amy Lee and produced by Moody and Dave Fortman; it was the fourth song to be written for Evanescence. Amy Lee's vocals and the piano parts of the song were recorded in NRG Recording Studios, California. The drums, bass and electric guitars were recorded at The Steakhouse Studio in North Hollywood. \"My Immortal\" was mixed by Dave Fortman at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood while it was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in New York City. The orchestral parts in the song were arranged by the composer Graeme Revell.\nThe earliest known demo of \"My Immortal\" was recorded in 1997, which solely featured Lee's vocals accompanied by a piano and slightly different lyrics. The song was intended to be included on the band's self-titled EP but was cut before it was released. In 2000, the song was re-recorded for the band's demo album, Origin, which contains a rearranged piano melody and lyrics, including the bridge added by Lee. It was again recorded for the band's debut full-length debut studio album, Fallen, where the vocals of the demo version were accompanied by slightly different instrumentation. It is also featured on the band's 2003 EP, Mystary, which is much more similar to the band version. Wind-up Records preferred the Origin version, which is why the exact vocals recorded from 2000 are again included in the song's album version. The version that was recorded and released as a single is moderately alternative to that of the album version and is often referred to as the \"band version\" because of the additional band performing the bridge and final chorus of the song. The later pressings of Fallen contain the single version (or \"band version\") of \"My Immortal\" as a hidden track. Lee expressed some dissatisfaction with the early versions of the song saying, \"It's not even a real piano. And the sound quality is bad because we had to break into the studio to record it late at night when no one was around because we couldn't afford a real session.\"\n\"My Immortal\" is a piano and power ballad written in the key of A major. It was described as a \"goth-meets-pop\" song. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing on the"

The song was written by Maurizio Bassi and Naimy Hackett, and released in 1985 as the lead single from Baltimora's debut album Living in the Background. The song was re-recorded and released in 1993, and has been covered by several artists throughout the years.\nThe refrain uses Tarzan's cry as a melodic line. The song is rhythmical, with an electronic melody and simple lyrics. Baltimora are often considered a one-hit wonder due to the success they experienced with \"Tarzan Boy\". It features what was later named the millennial whoop.\nThe music video for the song does not feature either Bassi or Hackett. Instead it features the front man for the band's performances, Jimmy McShane, who did not actually sing the song but rather lip synced it.\nThe song is currently used by Jungle Boy, a wrestler for AEW (All Elite Wrestling), as his entrance music.\n\"Tarzan Boy\" was an international hit, debuting in the top five Italian charts and performing well in several other European countries, including Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, and notably, France, where \"Tarzan Boy\" was most successful, topping the charts there for five consecutive weeks. In the United Kingdom, it reached number 3 in September 1985. The single had success in the United States (where it was released by EMI), with the single remaining on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six months and ultimately peaking at number 13 in early 1986.\nThe single \"Tarzan Boy\" bounced back into the Billboard Hot 100 chart in March 1993 as a remix, climbing to No. 51, at the time of its appearance in a Listerine commercial.

It was released by Wind-up Records on December 8, 2003, as the third single from the album. An alternative version appears on the band's fourth studio album Synthesis (2017). The song was written by guitarist Ben Moody, lead singer Amy Lee and keyboardist David Hodges, and it was produced by Moody and Dave Fortman. Various versions of \"My Immortal\" were recorded; one of them was included on the demo album Origin (2000) and another on the EP release Mystary (2003). The version originally appearing on Origin was later included on Fallen, featuring piano with backing strings. The version of the song released as a single was dubbed the \"band version\" because of the complete band's performance of the bridge and final chorus of the song.\n\"My Immortal\" is a piano power ballad with a slow tempo. Lyrically, it talks about \"a spirit staying with you after its death and haunting you until you actually wish that the spirit were gone because it won't leave you alone.\" Critical reception towards the song was positive, with critics complimenting its piano melody. In 2005, it received a nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 47th Grammy Awards. The song was also commercially successful, peaking within the top ten in more than ten countries. It charted at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, Greece and Portugal, as well as on the Billboard Adult Pop Songs chart. The single was certified gold in the United States and platinum in Australia.\nAn accompanying music video directed by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Gothic Quarter, Barcelona, on October 10, 2003. The video shows Lee sitting and singing on various locations but never touching the ground. Shots of Moody are also shown but he is never together with his band or Lee. The video was nominated in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was performed by the band during their three concert tours: the Fallen Tour (2003), The Open Door Tour (2007) and the Evanescence Tour (2011\u201312). It was also performed live during some of their television appearances and award ceremonies such as the Billboard Music Awards.\nThe song was written by Ben Moody and Amy Lee and produced by Moody and Dave Fortman; it was the fourth song to be written for Evanescence. Amy Lee's vocals and the piano parts of the song were recorded in NRG Recording Studios, California. The drums, bass and electric guitars were recorded at The Steakhouse Studio in North Hollywood. \"My Immortal\" was mixed by Dave Fortman at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood while it was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in New York City. The orchestral parts in the song were arranged by the composer Graeme Revell.\nThe earliest known demo of \"My Immortal\" was recorded in 1997, which solely featured Lee's vocals accompanied by a piano and slightly different lyrics. The song was intended to be included on the band's self-titled EP but was cut before it was released. In 2000, the song was re-recorded for the band's demo album, Origin, which contains a rearranged piano melody and lyrics, including the bridge added by Lee. It was again recorded for the band's debut full-length debut studio album, Fallen, where the vocals of the demo version were accompanied by slightly different instrumentation. It is also featured on the band's 2003 EP, Mystary, which is much more similar to the band version. Wind-up Records preferred the Origin version, which is why the exact vocals recorded from 2000 are again included in the song's album version. The version that was recorded and released as a single is moderately alternative to that of the album version and is often referred to as the \"band version\" because of the additional band performing the bridge and final chorus of the song. The later pressings of Fallen contain the single version (or \"band version\") of \"My Immortal\" as a hidden track. Lee expressed some dissatisfaction with the early versions of the song saying, \"It's not even a real piano. And the sound quality is bad because we had to break into the studio to record it late at night when no one was around because we couldn't afford a real session.\"\n\"My Immortal\" is a piano and power ballad written in the key of A major.

The song was produced by Mike 'Scribz' Riley and written by Misha B and Talay Riley. The song fuses R&B with dub step, reggae, pop, drum & bass elements, whilst also sampling the hook from The Fugees' 1996 single \"Fu-Gee-La\", which itself is based on Teena Marie's 1988 hit \"Ooo La La La\".\nThe single was featured on Digital Spy's 10 tracks you need to hear Playlist. So So Gay listed it on their Singles of the Week.\n\n\"Here's to Everything\" was written by Misha B and Talay Riley and produced by Scribz Riley. According to Misha, the concept of the track is \"here's to all the lows that make beautiful highs\". On sampling, she revealed that Lauryn Hill is one of her musical inspirations; \"I had to be cautious, she's one of my inspirations.\"\nIn an interview with on BBC 1xtra Misha B informed CJ Beatz that from the age of nine she had always wanted to produce a song about \"what life meant to me\", to \"write a song entitled or just surrounding the concept here\u2019s to everything\"; the track is a \"toast to life! It\u2019s a feel good song celebrating everything life throws at you. I loved making it and had been waiting to write a song like this for ages. Here it is! Here\u2019s to everything!\".\nSoul Culture noted that \"the upbeat single\" was fused R&B with reggae, pop, drum & bass elements, while Digital Spy mentioned \"bouncy drums that burst on the drum 'n' bass-pop chorus\". Misha B described the sound of the track as \"dub step infused with a splash reggae and dance\", with \"a dancey reggae style which I hope will get everyone dancing. Reggae is a style close to my heart, and I love to draw on my Jamaican roots. So Drums and rhythm are a real priority to me.\"\nOn 8 February 2013, Misha B announced that \"Here's to Everything (Ooh La La)\" would be released as the third single from her forthcoming debut album. On 15 February 2013, the song received its worldwide premier on The Hits Radio. On 19 March 2013, the artwork was released.\nThe single has had mixed reviews. 4music wrote a positive review, commenting, \"With lyrics like Dee Dee Dee Dee Dum and Ooh La La, the song is lighthearted, optimistic and is sure to put you in a good mood.\" Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave the song 3 out of 5 stars in a mixed-to-positive review saying that \"The sentiment may not be the most original, but come summer, we'll no doubt find ourselves raising a glass or two, or three...\" Mark Blankenship of NewNowNext.com wrote a positive review calling it  \"a heart-exploding command to dance your ass off and have a good time.\" Sarah Dean writing for Huffingtonpost called the track \"perfect happy music\" and regarded it as the closest the UK is going to get to a Nicki Minaj hit at the moment. EQ Music Blog reviewed it as an upbeat tune and a \"monster swaggering anthem set by a drum and bass beat... It\u2019s going to make you bump, bump, your hump, hump resolutely in happiness at it\u2019s [sic] every which way, crash and bang burst of positivity.\" Greg White of So So Gay labelled the single as \"a booming, drum n bass, pop number that\u2019s obviously vying to be a song of the summer.\"  Whilst noting that the track was \"slick and well-crafted\", he didn't find the song catchy and labelled it generic. He also expressed that it was too similar to Rihanna's sound and that Misha B tried too hard to flavour the track with a thick island accent. He continued to say that her signature \"powerful and heartfelt\" vocals were not present and labelled the lyrics as \"extremely common\" and lacking personality. Paul Leake of ClickMusic.com stated that with each single release she delivers a \"quality far above the norm for an X Factor alum.\" He went on to praise the track, which shows off \"both her talent as a pop artist and her musical influences, occasionally colliding with mixed results\". However, he thought the sampling felt \"more calculated than shrewd\".\nMisha B performed this song live on Blue Peter. She also performed acoustic versions for several music sites including grammy.com, the Virgin Red Room (Virgin Group), Kiss 100 London, Shazam.com and Planet Notion.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Here's To Everything (Ooh La La)\" debuted on the UK R&B Chart at number 7 on 5 May 2013. It also entered the UK Singles Chart at number 35 in the same week, but did not stay in the top 40.\n\nThe music video was directed by Justin Dickel and produced by Alex Bedford, and was filmed from 24 to 26 February 2013.

It was composed by drummer Peter Criss, his friend Stan Penridge and producer Bob Ezrin. Casablanca Records released it as a single in August 1976, after it was released as the B-side of \"Detroit Rock City\". \"Beth\" is Kiss's biggest commercial hit in the United States; it reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100, received a Gold Record certification from the RIAA, and won the 1977 People's Choice Award for \"Favorite Song\". In 2003, \"Beth\" ranked #3 in VH1's 25 Greatest Power Ballads.\nThe song, originally titled \"Beck\", was composed by Criss and Penridge during their time with the band Chelsea. During the recording of Destroyer, Criss showed it to Ezrin, who made several changes to it and recommended changing its title to \"Beth\". \"Beth\" has appeared on several compilations and live albums, including Kiss Unplugged (1996), where the group performed it acoustically.\nBy 1975, Kiss had released three studio albums, in which the compositional contributions of drummer Peter Criss were minimal; the only track on which he appeared credited was the instrumental track \"Love Theme from Kiss\", written by the four members of the band and included in their debut album. Criss assumed the role of vocalist in other songs created by his bandmates; however, for Destroyer, Criss set himself the goal of adding one of his own compositions. During a limousine ride, Criss sang a fast-paced version of \"Beck\" for bassist Gene Simmons and guitarist Paul Stanley, assuming they would not be interested in including a sentimental ballad on the album. Simmons and Stanley suggested that he sing it to producer Bob Ezrin, who agreed to record it and assured him that it would be a success.\nDuring Criss's time in Chelsea, he and the group's guitarist Stan Penridge decided to write a mocking song about the wife of their bandmate Mike Brand, Becky. According to Criss, she regularly called the group during rehearsals to ask when her husband would come home, and this gave them the idea of composing the first verse of the song: \"Beck, I hear you callin', but I can't come home right now. Me and the boys are playin', and we just can't find the sound\". Criss later admitted that he composed the song for his first wife, Lydia.\nCriss sang the song to Bob Ezrin, who decided to include it in Destroyer because Kiss' other songs were primarily about sex, and \"Beck\" was a love song that \"everyone would relate to\". Ezrin made several arrangements of the song's melody and wrote part of the lyrics. Gene Simmons suggested changing the name to \"Beth\" because it would be easier to sing and to avoid confusion with Jeff Beck. However, Lydia Criss later claimed credit for proposing the change for the same reason, and because the original Becky had a twin sister named Beth.\nIn his autobiography, Simmons recounted that \"I have never seen [Criss] compose a single song. Peter might have contributed a line or two of the lyrics, but after listening to Penridge's original demo, it's clear who made the original song\". In 2014, during an interview for Rolling Stone, Paul Stanley agreed with Simmons's assessment that Penridge was the main author, and he commented that Criss had nothing to do with the composition of \"Beth\", adding that \"if you write one hit, you should be able to write two\". Criss, in his defense, mentioned that Stanley was jealous because \"he is the main vocalist of a group in which he did not write the greatest success. That's his problem. They hate the fact that I was the songwriter of a hit and won the People's Choice\".\nFor the song's recording, Ezrin brought the New York Philharmonic orchestra and musician Dick Wagner into the A&R studio as a substitute for Ace Frehley. According to Criss and Simmons, Frehley did not participate in the recording because he was engaged in playing cards with friends. Once the orchestra arrived at the studio, Ezrin suggested that all 25 members wear fake tuxedos and that Criss appear in the studio in his trademark makeup so he could take some pictures. For his part, Ezrin put on a top hat and played the grand piano. Finally, Criss recorded the vocals at the Record Plant studio.\nStructurally, \"Beth\" lacks a solo; instead, the mid-octave section repeats the intro along with the chorus in an orchestral interlude. The sound of the violin and viola, led by the cello, change the key from C major to A minor and then the trumpets, tubas, trombones and French horns enter, accentuating the hook.\nThe song was a last-minute addition to"

It was released by Wind-up Records on December 8, 2003, as the third single from the album. An alternative version appears on the band's fourth studio album Synthesis (2017). The song was written by guitarist Ben Moody, lead singer Amy Lee and keyboardist David Hodges, and it was produced by Moody and Dave Fortman. Various versions of \"My Immortal\" were recorded; one of them was included on the demo album Origin (2000) and another on the EP release Mystary (2003). The version originally appearing on Origin was later included on Fallen, featuring piano with backing strings. The version of the song released as a single was dubbed the \"band version\" because of the complete band's performance of the bridge and final chorus of the song.\n\"My Immortal\" is a piano power ballad with a slow tempo. Lyrically, it talks about \"a spirit staying with you after its death and haunting you until you actually wish that the spirit were gone because it won't leave you alone.\" Critical reception towards the song was positive, with critics complimenting its piano melody. In 2005, it received a nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 47th Grammy Awards. The song was also commercially successful, peaking within the top ten in more than ten countries. It charted at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, Greece and Portugal, as well as on the Billboard Adult Pop Songs chart. The single was certified gold in the United States and platinum in Australia.\nAn accompanying music video directed by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Gothic Quarter, Barcelona, on October 10, 2003. The video shows Lee sitting and singing on various locations but never touching the ground. Shots of Moody are also shown but he is never together with his band or Lee. The video was nominated in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was performed by the band during their three concert tours: the Fallen Tour (2003), The Open Door Tour (2007) and the Evanescence Tour (2011\u201312). It was also performed live during some of their television appearances and award ceremonies such as the Billboard Music Awards.\nThe song was written by Ben Moody and Amy Lee and produced by Moody and Dave Fortman; it was the fourth song to be written for Evanescence. Amy Lee's vocals and the piano parts of the song were recorded in NRG Recording Studios, California. The drums, bass and electric guitars were recorded at The Steakhouse Studio in North Hollywood. \"My Immortal\" was mixed by Dave Fortman at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood while it was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in New York City. The orchestral parts in the song were arranged by the composer Graeme Revell.\nThe earliest known demo of \"My Immortal\" was recorded in 1997, which solely featured Lee's vocals accompanied by a piano and slightly different lyrics. The song was intended to be included on the band's self-titled EP but was cut before it was released. In 2000, the song was re-recorded for the band's demo album, Origin, which contains a rearranged piano melody and lyrics, including the bridge added by Lee. It was again recorded for the band's debut full-length debut studio album, Fallen, where the vocals of the demo version were accompanied by slightly different instrumentation. It is also featured on the band's 2003 EP, Mystary, which is much more similar to the band version. Wind-up Records preferred the Origin version, which is why the exact vocals recorded from 2000 are again included in the song's album version. The version that was recorded and released as a single is moderately alternative to that of the album version and is often referred to as the \"band version\" because of the additional band performing the bridge and final chorus of the song. The later pressings of Fallen contain the single version (or \"band version\") of \"My Immortal\" as a hidden track. Lee expressed some dissatisfaction with the early versions of the song saying, \"It's not even a real piano. And the sound quality is bad because we had to break into the studio to record it late at night when no one was around because we couldn't afford a real session.\"\n\"My Immortal\" is a piano and power ballad written in the key of A major. It was described as a \"goth-meets-pop\" song. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing on the"

Recorded late into the production of Rowland's second solo album Ms. Kelly (2007), the song was released on March 13, 2007 as the lead single from the album. The artists co-wrote the song with its producers Sean Garrett, Polow da Don, Blac Elvis, and Jason Perry, with additional production from S-Dot. \"Like This\" is a R&B song, with its lyrics referring to a woman growing out of a past relationship.\nThe song received generally positive critical reviews. Upon its release, the song became Rowland's highest-charting solo success since her 2002 single \"Stole\", reaching the top-ten in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as  the top-twenty in Australia and New Zealand and number 30 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. In addition, it became Rowland's first single to peak at the top position on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. An accompanying music video was directed by Mike Ruiz and filmed in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, California in mid-March 2007.\n\"Like This\" was written by Sean Garrett, Polow da Don, Blac Elvis, Jason Perry, Rowland, and rapper Eve Jeffers. The song was one of the last songs on the Ms. Kelly album that Rowland and Garrett started working on in mid-September 2006 after the cancellation of My Story, the album's actual version. Conceived around an instrumental track from da Don, Rowland declared \"Like This\" the perfect example of what attitude she exactly had on her mind when creating the revamped version the album, telling MTV News in 2007: \"Polow already had this hot track. I loved the sound of the cowbell; it was so different! Sean and I started writing and he said 'Kelly this is your first single'.\" Happy about finally running \"into that song that definitely sticks out\" after many months recording, Rowland eventually took a break from recording.\nInitially titled \"Wooo!\" and \"Bump like This\", Rowland resumed recording weeks later after she had approached Eve to appear on the song. \"I just heard Eve on this song\", she recalled. \"I knew her energy belonged on the song and, just like that, it all came together. Then I knew: This was the single [...] and it turned out he [Sean] was right.\" Garrett further elaoborated in an interview with MTV: \"It's a great combination of her thoughts and her feel on the type of music that she likes to do. It's a cross between something in a club and on mainstream radio. We're just trying to stay a step ahead of what's going on.\" Next to Polow da Don, Garrett, S-Dot, and Elvis received co-producer credits on \"Like This\". Vocal production was helmed by Rowland and Max Gousse, while mixing was handled Jean Marie Horvat with Colin Miller serving as assistant.\n\"Like This\" received generally positive review from contemporary music critics. Spence D. of media website IGN observed that \"Rowland's playfully serious stance is exposed on the jump off track, which surges to a Polow the Don groove that is slinky and invigorating. Toss in a little cameo from Eve and you've got one of those sizzling summertime mid-tempo jammies that'll appeal to even the most sullen of R&B pop fans.\" BBC critic Gemma Padley wrote that the song \"works an hypnotic riff not a million miles away from Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot\u201d Billboard felt that \"compared with her gospel-fueled 2002 solo debut Simply Deep, Rowland appears confident and dominant on foot-stompers like [...] the Eve-assisted single.\" Metro's Shereen Low declared it a \"stomping tune,\" while Sal Cinquemani from Slant called the song \"hot and fresh\" and ranked it 33rd on Slant's Best Albums & Singles of 2007 listing.\nMichael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly found that \"it\u2019s gota bouncy enough beat, and a 'ladies leave your man at home' vibe that\u2019s reminiscent of Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s \u201cJumpin', Jumpin'\u201d but aside from the bridge, the vocal could\u2019ve been handled by prettymuch any female singer on the charts today [...] And shouldn\u2019t a singer of Kelly\u2019s caliber deliver something a little more distinctive for a lead single?\" Guardian journalist Rosie Swash found that \"whilst \"Like This\" is hardly Rowland's Sistine Chapel, the 26-year-old's new track does have something to it [...] The rumbling drums, the sparse keyboard chords, the Lil' Kim-esque \"I told y'all I was gonna bump like this!\", well, damned if Rowland isn't having the time of her life.\" In his review for Splice Today, Noah Berlatsky called the song \"surprisingly"

It was released on a non-album single in March 1968, as the B-side to \"Lady Madonna\". The song was the first Harrison composition to be issued on a Beatles single and reflects the band's embrace of Transcendental Meditation, which they were studying in India under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the time of the single's release. After \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\", it was the last of Harrison's three songs from the Beatles era that demonstrate an overt Indian classical influence and are styled as Indian pieces. The lyrics are a rendering of a poem from the Taoist Tao Te Ching, which he set to music on the recommendation of Juan Mascar\u00f3, a Sanskrit scholar who had translated the passage in his 1958 book Lamps of Fire.\nHarrison recorded the instrumental track for \"The Inner Light\" in Bombay in January 1968, during the sessions for his Wonderwall Music soundtrack album. It is the only Beatles studio recording to be made outside Europe and introduced Indian instruments such as sarod, shehnai and pakhavaj to the band's sound. The musicians on the track include Aashish Khan, Hanuman Jadev and Hariprasad Chaurasia. Aside from Harrison's lead vocal, recorded in London, the Beatles' only contribution came in the form of group backing vocals over the song's final line. In the decade following its release, the song became a comparative rarity among the band's recordings; it has subsequently appeared on compilation albums such as Rarities, Past Masters, Volume Two and Mono Masters.\n\"The Inner Light\" has received praise from several music critics and musicologists for its melodic qualities and its evocation of the meditation experience. Jeff Lynne and Anoushka Shankar performed the song at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death. An alternative take of the 1968 instrumental track was released in 2014 on the remastered Wonderwall Music CD. Screenwriter Morgan Gendel named a 1992 episode of the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation as an homage to the song. In 2020, Harrison's Material World Foundation announced The Inner Light Challenge, an initiative to raise funds for the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund, Save the Children and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison recalls that he was inspired to write \"The Inner Light\" by Juan Mascar\u00f3, a Sanskrit scholar at Cambridge University. Mascar\u00f3 had taken part in a debate, televised on The Frost Programme on 4 October 1967, during which Harrison and John Lennon discussed the merits of Transcendental Meditation with an audience of academics and religious leaders. In a subsequent letter to Harrison, dated 16 November, Mascar\u00f3 expressed the hope that they might meet again before the Beatles departed for India, where the group were to study meditation with their guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Mascar\u00f3 enclosed a copy of his book Lamps of Fire, an anthology of religious writings, including from Lao-Tzu's Tao Te Ching. Having stated his admiration for the spiritual message in Harrison's composition \"Within You Without You\", Mascar\u00f3 enquired: \"might it not be interesting to put into your music a few words of Tao, for example no. 48, page 66 of Lamps?\"\nHarrison wrote the song during a period when he had undertaken his first musical project outside the Beatles, composing the soundtrack to the Joe Massot-directed film Wonderwall, and continued to study the Indian sitar, partly under the tutelage of Ravi Shankar. When writing \"The Inner Light\", he made minimal alterations to the translated Lao-Tzu text and used the same title that Mascar\u00f3 had used. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison says of the changes required to create his second verse:\nIn the original poem, the verse says \"Without going out of my door, I can know the ways of heaven.\" And so to prevent any misinterpretations \u2013 and also to make the song a bit longer \u2013 I did repeat that as a second verse but made it: \"Without going out of your door / You can know all things on earth / Without looking out of your window / You can know the ways of heaven\" \u2013 so that it included everybody.\nAfter \"Within You Without You\", \"The Inner Light\" was the second composition to fully reflect Harrison's immersion in Eastern spiritual concepts, particularly meditation, an interest"

It features vocals by American rapper Lil Wayne, who wrote his guest verse, while the original composition was written by members of collective The Clutch including Balewa Muhammad, Candice Nelson, Ezekiel Lewis, along with Marcella Araica and Nathaniel \"Danja\" Hills. Production was also handled by Hills. The song was first released for digital download in the United States on August 5, 2008, through Bad Boy and NextSelection in association with Atlantic Records, who then serviced it to rhythmic contemporary radio stations on September 22, 2008. The single was issued on vinyl as well with a promotional record being released that month.\nOriginally intended to be the first single from her second studio album, \"Official Girl\" is an R&B song, with the beat being referred to as \"candy-floss production.\" Cassie stated the track stood out to her for its relatability with a good message and for being musically different. The song's lyrics consist of Cassie seeking status confirmation in a relationship as she is presented at a crisis between vulnerability and authority; she clarified its meaning as \"standing up for what you want out of it.\" It garnered generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its production and Cassie's delivery of the song's lyrical content.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Chris Robinson and its concept revolves around Cassie's interpretation of the track's message, in which she grows frustrated over the uncertainty of a relationship with a man before deciding to break things off with him. The video's dance segments and styling generated Aaliyah comparisons. \"Official Girl\" debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot Videoclip Tracks and the Norway Digital Songs charts, also topping MTV's Total Request Live countdown.\nAfter releasing two singles from her self-titled debut album, \"Me & U\" and \"Long Way 2 Go,\" Cassie went back home for a period of time, \"I got really sick and was in the hospital in like November or December. It was stress and exhaustion, and I ended up going home to Connecticut. [Puffy] actually called me up when I was at home and asked me what I wanted to do. I was like, 'I want to do another album.'\" She returned to the studio in 2007 with Ryan Leslie, who had co-written and produced the entire album released in the previous year. It was reported she would also be collaborating with Pharrell Williams and Kanye West, after being featured as the female lead in the latter's \"Stronger\" music video. Later that year, she released \"Is It You,\" included in the soundtrack album of the dance film Step Up 2: The Streets released in February 2008, in which she starred as Sophie Donovan.\nCassie then talked about her yet-untitled sophomore project: \"I found the sound that I was after, which is the hardest thing especially when you're moving onto a project that is so much more important and you have so much to prove,\" elaborating on its sound, \"Now it's about becoming a woman, and I'm not quite there yet, but I'm going through the experiences that make me get there. It's a more vulnerable album; it's a little bit stripped down as far as vocally and the content in the songs.\" Cassie added she was working with various other producers, including Danja and Jim Beanz, and had been looking forward to that opportunity particularly after hearing a song they had produced for Britney Spears called \"Perfect Lover.\" She stated in another interview that she was more vulnerable in her new songs, and that her vocals could be heard better. She felt there was \"real emotion and a much realer connection with [her] fans.\" She said that her first single would be \"a club record \u2013 something fun and danceable,\" and cited \"My House,\" \"Push It\" and \"Thirsty\" as possible single choices for the album.\nOn February 11, 2008, Cassie made an appearance on MTV's Total Request Live to promote Step Up 2 and announced the first single from her upcoming album would be \"Official Girl,\" produced by Danja and written by The Clutch. Diddy discussed the single with Billboard, revealing the album was tentatively scheduled for a September release and it would \"really, really catch people off guard,\" mentioning Spears and Janet Jackson as influences. A solo version of \"Official Girl\" was made available for streaming on Cassie's MySpace page on April 10, 2008. A demo version of the track had been originally recorded by"

It was written by Isaac Hasson, Lindy Robbins and Mher Filian and produced by SuperSpy, for Lovato's second studio album of the same name. It was released as the album's lead single on June 23, 2009, through Hollywood Records. The song was the only single from Here We Go Again released in North America. \"Here We Go Again\" is a power pop song with guitar lines and pop hooks and the lyrics speak of the protagonist's on-off relationship with a hesitant boyfriend.\nThe song received positive reviews from critics, who praised its pop hook and made comparisons to works of Kelly Clarkson. \"Here We Go Again\" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Lovato's first top 40 hit on the chart as a solo artist. The song was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2014. It also peaked at number 38 in New Zealand and in the lower region of the Canadian Hot 100.\nLovato released their debut studio album, Don't Forget, in September 2008. Shortly thereafter in January 2009, they had already begun writing material for their sophomore effort. The recording sessions for the album began in January 2009, right after filming from the first season of Sonny with a Chance. According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly finished in just two weeks. Unlike Don't Forget, Lovato did not collaborate with the Jonas Brothers for their second album as they wanted to see what their sound would be like without their input. \"Here We Go Again\" was written by Isaac Hasson, Lindy Robbins and Mher Filian, and produced by Hasson and Filian under the production name SuperSpy. The duo also co-wrote and produced the album track \"U Got Nothin' on Me\".\n\"Here We Go Again\" was recorded at three different recording studios in California; SuperSpy Studios in Los Angeles, Resonate Studios in Burbank, and The Jungle Room in Glendale. Additional recording took place at Safe House Studios in Greensboro, North Carolina. Co-writer Robbins contributed backing vocals. Hasson provided programming, guitars and synths, and Filian handled programming and keys. The instruments were played by Dorian Crozier, who provided drums, and Kenny Johnson, who played the bass. The song was ultimately mixed by Chris Lord-Alge. \"Here We Go Again\" premiered during Planet Premiere on Radio Disney on June 17, 2009, and was released as the lead single for the album of the same name via digital download on June 23, through Hollywood Records. It was later released in Australia and New Zealand on July 17, 2009.\n\"Here We Go Again\" is an uptempo pop-rock song, with guitar lines and pop hooks. Critics made comparisons with works by Kelly Clarkson, particularly the song \"Since U Been Gone\". According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, \"Here We Go Again\" is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderately fast tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F major and Lovato's vocal range spans from the low note of F\u2083 to the high note of A\u2085. It has a basic sequence of F\u2013Dm\u2013Dm\u2013Gm/B\u266d\u2013F as its chord progression. The song's lyrics chronicle the protagonist's on-off relationship with an indecisive boy as they sing that \"Something about you is so addictive\". Lovato explained: \"So it's about, basically, being in a relationship where you break-up and you make-up, and you break-up and it's like 'Here we go again, we just keep doing this over and over'.\"\n\n\"Here We Go Again\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. The Arizona Republic's Ed Masley referred it to as \"an explosion of pop hooks delivered with a winning blend of heartache and bravado\". Kerri Mason of Billboard called the song a potential hit single and noted that Lovato \"almost sounds like Kelly Clarkson's kid sister\". Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times compared it to Clarkson's \"Since U Been Gone\" and wrote that Lovato \"tells a guy where to stick it over buff guitar lines\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the album \"not quite as much fun\" as Don't Forget, \"but still fun, particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like 'Here We Go Again'.\" Erlewine also named it one of the best tracks on the album. Chicago Tribune's Althea Legaspi referred it to as \"anthemic\" and \"catchy\", while Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra described it was not as \"immediate a grabber\" as Lovato's previous singles.\nIn the"

It features vocals by American rapper Lil Wayne, who wrote his guest verse, while the original composition was written by members of collective The Clutch including Balewa Muhammad, Candice Nelson, Ezekiel Lewis, along with Marcella Araica and Nathaniel \"Danja\" Hills. Production was also handled by Hills. The song was first released for digital download in the United States on August 5, 2008, through Bad Boy and NextSelection in association with Atlantic Records, who then serviced it to rhythmic contemporary radio stations on September 22, 2008. The single was issued on vinyl as well with a promotional record being released that month.\nOriginally intended to be the first single from her second studio album, \"Official Girl\" is an R&B song, with the beat being referred to as \"candy-floss production.\" Cassie stated the track stood out to her for its relatability with a good message and for being musically different. The song's lyrics consist of Cassie seeking status confirmation in a relationship as she is presented at a crisis between vulnerability and authority; she clarified its meaning as \"standing up for what you want out of it.\" It garnered generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its production and Cassie's delivery of the song's lyrical content.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Chris Robinson and its concept revolves around Cassie's interpretation of the track's message, in which she grows frustrated over the uncertainty of a relationship with a man before deciding to break things off with him. The video's dance segments and styling generated Aaliyah comparisons. \"Official Girl\" debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot Videoclip Tracks and the Norway Digital Songs charts, also topping MTV's Total Request Live countdown.\nAfter releasing two singles from her self-titled debut album, \"Me & U\" and \"Long Way 2 Go,\" Cassie went back home for a period of time, \"I got really sick and was in the hospital in like November or December. It was stress and exhaustion, and I ended up going home to Connecticut. [Puffy] actually called me up when I was at home and asked me what I wanted to do. I was like, 'I want to do another album.'\" She returned to the studio in 2007 with Ryan Leslie, who had co-written and produced the entire album released in the previous year. It was reported she would also be collaborating with Pharrell Williams and Kanye West, after being featured as the female lead in the latter's \"Stronger\" music video. Later that year, she released \"Is It You,\" included in the soundtrack album of the dance film Step Up 2: The Streets released in February 2008, in which she starred as Sophie Donovan.\nCassie then talked about her yet-untitled sophomore project: \"I found the sound that I was after, which is the hardest thing especially when you're moving onto a project that is so much more important and you have so much to prove,\" elaborating on its sound, \"Now it's about becoming a woman, and I'm not quite there yet, but I'm going through the experiences that make me get there. It's a more vulnerable album; it's a little bit stripped down as far as vocally and the content in the songs.\" Cassie added she was working with various other producers, including Danja and Jim Beanz, and had been looking forward to that opportunity particularly after hearing a song they had produced for Britney Spears called \"Perfect Lover.\" She stated in another interview that she was more vulnerable in her new songs, and that her vocals could be heard better. She felt there was \"real emotion and a much realer connection with [her] fans.\" She said that her first single would be \"a club record \u2013 something fun and danceable,\" and cited \"My House,\" \"Push It\" and \"Thirsty\" as possible single choices for the album.\nOn February 11, 2008, Cassie made an appearance on MTV's Total Request Live to promote Step Up 2 and announced the first single from her upcoming album would be \"Official Girl,\" produced by Danja and written by The Clutch. Diddy discussed the single with Billboard, revealing the album was tentatively scheduled for a September release and it would \"really, really catch people off guard,\" mentioning Spears and Janet Jackson as influences.

It is the second single from his third studio album Graffiti, released as a digital download on November 24, 2009. The song was produced by The Messengers and was written by Brown. The song is about yearning to rebuild a failed relationship and was interpreted by critics as being about Brown's former relationship with Barbadian singer Rihanna. However, Brown has stated the song is not about any of his previous relationships.\nThe song received positive to mixed reviews. It charted in the top twenty in Japan and New Zealand, and the top forty in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It peaked in the United States at number fifty-three. The accompanying music video features Brown and American R&B singer Cassie as his love interest. In the video, he yearns for their relationship on a winter night in a city and in a desert scene. Brown performed the song on his 2009 Fan Appreciation Tour, and on BET's SOS: Help for Haiti Telethon, which benefited victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\nThe song was leaked to internet on October 21, 2009, one day after ex-girlfriend Rihanna's ballad \"Russian Roulette\" was also leaked. The song, which has been described as \"melancholy\", sees Brown singing about a relationship that has slipped out of his hands with its chorus calling for an \"incremental reconciliation\" of the unspecified relationship. Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News noted that both \"Crawl\" and Rihanna's \"Russian Roulette\" would inevitably be interpreted as being about Brown and Rihanna's relationship.\nIn an interview with MTV News, Brown stated that the song is not about Rihanna or any of his previous relationships. He called the message of the song \"universal\", and not just about love but \"any type of heartache.\" About the track he said, \"When I heard the whole concept and everything I was like, 'Yo, this is crazy. So being able to express the feelings, it was like, probably one of the best [records I've done.] But it was more than me trying to do a record that meant crawl to love, crawl back to love. Meaning whether it's from your negative situations, whether it's from any problems you've dealt with, like anybody's situation.\" Although he stated his concept for the song was about love, he said for anybody, the song could be \"inspired as far it being the war or a death in the family, whether it's anything, anybody just crawl back to love.\"\nThe music video was edited by David Blackburn and directed by Joseph Kahn, who also worked with Brown on the \"I Can Transform Ya\" and \"Forever\" videos. The video features American R&B singer Cassie as Brown's love interest. Kahn had previously directed the video for Britney Spears's 2008 'comeback' song, \"Womanizer\", after her public breakdown. In an interview with MTV News, Kahn said, \"I seem to be the guy that record companies go to when they need help,\" he joked. \"I truly feel [Brown] is remorseful. You don't drop people just because they made a mistake (even if it was a big mistake).\"\nKahn said that the entire idea for the video was Brown's: \"It's an interesting video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically told me a story of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I fell in love with the idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper.\" When comparing the song's video to that of \"I Can Transform Ya\", the director said, \"'Crawl' is my favorite one, because \u2014 gosh, I'm going to let you in on this \u2014 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done.\" He went on to say, \"I mean, everything that's happened to him in the year, I think this is going to be his big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now.\" When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn said that the video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the \"genesis\" of what that idea was.\nOn November 2, 2009, several stills from the video were released onto the internet. The photos focused on two sets of the video, a desert location, and a snow and puddle-spotted alleyway. In both settings, Brown wears the same thick black glasses, brown leather trench coat, white T-shirt, and fingerless gloves, among other attire. Cassie appears in a photo from the alleyway scenes, as the desert scenes show Brown in \"deep contemplation\". The video first aired"

Produced by Wolf & Epic, it was released on April 9, 1992.\nIn the song Lyte talks about social issues such as AIDS, crack and teenage pregnancy.\nIn May 1992 \"Eyes Are the Soul\" peaked No.\u00a084 on the Billboard's Hot R&B Singles.\nIn each verse of the song, Lyte describes a different afflicted person. The first person in the narrative is a male with HIV\u2013AIDS, the second person is a crack addict wanted by the law, and the third is a young, black, pregnant teenager who is considering abortion.\nShortly after the single was released, speaking at a Baltimore school, she confessed that \"Sometimes I get discouraged when I do songs like this and they don't get as popular as (others). I'm just trying to get the message out.\"\nDuring an interview with Ebony in 2012, Lyte commented on the song's AIDS prevention message:\n\"I can't even tell you that I had lost someone or that I knew of anyone who had lost someone(...) I just knew this disease was on its way to causing devastation in the world, but specifically in our communities, and that knowledge just scared the mess out of me.\"\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" was included on her compilation albums The Very Best of MC Lyte (2001), Rhyme Masters (2005), and Cold Rock a Party \u2013 Best of MC Lyte (2019) The music video was included on the compilation video album Lyte Years (1991).\nConnie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times highlighted the song in her album review, saying \"AIDS, crack addiction and teen pregnancy are topics treated with nonjudgmental empathy.\" James Bernard of Entertainment Weekly called the song \"my own favorite\", commenting \"Lyte slips into a storytelling mode to convey the anguish of her peers who are grappling with AIDS, drug addiction, and the specter of the abortion clinic.

The song was recorded by the former and featured as a track on the album This Is It (2009), which accompanies the 2009 concert documentary Michael Jackson's This Is It.\nIt was premiered worldwide on Jackson's official website on October 12, 2009, four months after his death on June 25, 2009. Although Sony Music Entertainment referred to the song as a \"new single\" during its promotion, it was later confirmed that the song would only be sent for airplay, and not be available to buy as a single release. According to Anka, the song was recorded in 1983 and intended to be a duet between him and Jackson on Anka's  Walk a Fine Line album under the title \"I Never Heard\", but these plans fell through. Thereafter, Sa-Fire recorded the track for her album, I Wasn't Born Yesterday (1991). The duet version of the song was featured in Anka's 2013 Duets album. While putting together the This Is It album, Jackson's demo version of the song was found. His brothers' vocals and additional instrumentation were then added to the recording.\nA pop ballad,  The instrumentation includes piano, guitar, percussion, and strings. Jackson's version, styled as a pop ballad, was his first song to chart on Billboard's Hot Adult Contemporary Chart in over seventeen years. The song was generally well received by critics and enjoyed good chart performances globally. It became a top twenty hit on charts in Japan and Spain, and peaked at number 18 on both Billboard's US Adult Contemporary and R&B/Hip-Hop song charts. In 2011, it received a Grammy Award nomination. The song was also accompanied by a music video, directed by Spike Lee, which consisted of footage of Jackson as a child, clips of him throughout his career, and footage of tributes from Jackson's fans around the world.\nAlthough it shared its name, the song was not intentionally made for the 2009 concert documentary Michael Jackson's This Is It. \"This Is It\" was written by recording artists Paul Anka and Michael Jackson, and a demo version of the song was recorded by Anka and Jackson in 1983 at Anka's California recording studio. The song was intended to be added as an album track on Anka's 1983 duets album Walk a Fine Line that he was in the process of recording at the time.\nSoon after the alleged theft in the '80s, Anka threatened to take legal action if the recordings were not returned. Jackson's version of \"This Is It\" was reportedly found in a box of tapes with only Jackson's voice and a piano accompaniment, the song was described as having been a \"bare-bone\" recording. Jackson subsequently returned the tapes, although Anka insisted that Jackson had made a copy of the recordings of \"I Never Heard\" and retitled the track with his voice to \"This Is It.\" In 1990, Anka allowed the Puerto Rican R&B recording artist Sa-Fire to record \"This Is It\", which she did under the original title \"I Never Heard\" on her second studio album I Wasn't Born Yesterday in 1991.\nOn September 13, 2009, it was reported that a \"secret Michael Jackson single\" was being produced to promote the film Michael Jackson's This Is It, so that the song's release would coincide with the release of  the film. It was shelved until producers in Los Angeles, California decided to remix the vocals with an orchestral accompaniment. On September 23, Sony Music Entertainment announced they were planning on releasing a song entitled, \"This Is It\" as a single. The song was to feature backing vocals by several of Jackson's brothers  and would be included in a two-disc album, This Is It. It was also confirmed that the song would be featured during the end credits of the movie production. Sony said, in response to the reports, that it was a coincidence that his upcoming concert series was also titled \"This Is It\", explaining they had no evidence that he had planned to release the song. However, John McClain and John Branca, two representatives of Jackson's estate said, in a prepared statement, that \"This Is It\" was \"picked because the lyrics were appropriate because of the name Michael [Jackson] gave his tour\" and that they"

Cha Cha Cha is the lead single from MC Lyte's second album Eyes on This. Produced by King Of Chill, who also has songwriting credits, it was released on September 8, 1989.\nThe song stayed 18 weeks on the recently created Billboard Hot Rap Singles and became one of the first songs to peak at No.\u00a01 on that chart, staying there for two weeks in December 1989. Although MC Lyte had already reached #1 on Rap chart a few months earlier with the collaborative single \"Self Destruction\", this was the first time that a woman had achieved it as the lead artist. In turn, it would also become Lyte's first appearance on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop (then called \"Billboard Hot Black Singles\"), peaking No.\u00a035.\nIn 2008 \"Cha Cha Cha\" was No.\u00a054 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop list and Lil' Kim performed a rewritten version on her mixtape, Ms. G.O.A.T.\nAlthough the song's credits only feature King of Chill as the songwriter, MC Lyte stated that they wrote the song together:\n\u201cThere were occasions like a song like \u2018Cha Cha Cha\u2019 King of Chill wrote that with me. I didn\u2019t have a problem with opening the door to someone writing with me at times. But I had to have my stamp in it, on it and all round it because I\u2019m not just saying whatever someone writes.\u201d\nAlso comment about the lyrics:\n\u201cThere were some things that were humorous in there that I didn\u2019t write or didn\u2019t like or thought was the hottest line I ever said. It was comical to me\u2026like that line, \u2018Well, well, well, I\u2019ll be damned.\u2019 But turned out that that\u2019s one of the most memorable parts of \u2018Cha Cha Cha.\u2019 Whenever I perform it that\u2019s the part that the whole crowd wants to say. So sometimes you have to get out of yourself and let a new way of approaching a rhyme happen.\u201d\nThe song contains samples of Four Tops's \"I Can't Live Without You\" bass part, Kraftwerk's \"The Man-Machine\" lead synth part, Funkadelic's \"Good Old Music\"'s drum, Cerrone's \"Rocket in the Pocket\"'s drum, and The Fearless Four's \"Rockin' It\" hook. The song also has a vocal interpolation of herself on \"Kickin' 4 Brooklyn\" from her debut album.\nThe music video for the song, directed by Tamra Davis, was filmed in August 1989 on Randall's Island, New York City. In the video, shot almost entirely in black and white, Lyte is shown alongside her bodyguard, her DJ K-Rock, and her dancers Leg One and Leg Two.\nIt was included on her compilation video album Lyte Years (1991).\n\"Cha Cha Cha\" was included in his compilation albums The Very Best of MC Lyte (2001), The Shit I Never Dropped (2003), Rhyme Masters (2005), Rhino Hi-Five: MC Lyte (2007), Cold Rock a Party - Best Of MC Lyte (2019)  and on the EastWest Maxi-Single \"Lyte Of A Decade\" (1996).\nIn the fall of 1991 she performed the song at the Pay-per-view TV concert   Sisters In The Name of Rap.\nThe song was performed by Da Brat and Remy Ma at the MC Lyte tribute at the 2006 VH1 Hip Hop Honors.\nThe song was also featured on the soundtrack of the video game Grand Theft Auto IV on the fictional in-game station \"The Classics 104.1\".\nIn October 2008 she performed \"Cha Cha Cha\" at the BET Hip Hop Awards.\nIn October 14, 2014, MC Lyte performed this song to President Barack Obama in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the legislation that created the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts.\nIn 1999, Ego Trip's editors ranked Cha Cha Cha No.\u00a027 in their list Hip Hop's 40 Greatest Singles by Year 1989 in Ego Trip's Book of Rap Lists.\nIn 2008, it was No.\u00a054 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.\n\nIn 2009, PopMatters's Quentin B. Huff reviewed the song in his note \"I still love H.E.R. (and so should everyone else)\", commenting: \n\"(MC Lyte) tenor of voice and the precision of her delivery make her undeniable, not to mention her willingness to try a variety of subject matter. Despite the variety, however, she is well suited to battle mode where she can verbally stomp her competition. \"Cha Cha Cha\" is that type of song, but the execution is so smooth, with one of the slinkiest bass lines in all of rap, that she accomplishes her mission without being menacing. At the same time, she naturally sounds a bit like a mobster from an old black-and-white movie. I can easily see her pulling a Humphrey Bogart and saying something like, \"Move kid, ya botha me. Am-scray, will ya?\" \"Cha Cha Cha\" is more subdued and matter of fact than \"I'm Bad\", LL Cool J's earnest tribute to his lyrical skill.\"\nJack White revealed the song as the primary inspiration behind his 2014 Grammy\u2013nominated"

Written by Usher, Dupri and Cox, the song is a confession of a man to his woman about his impregnated mistress. This is a continuation of \"Confessions Part I\" which relates to a man's infidelity. Its personal content evoked rumors and early responses from the public even before its release, believing that Usher was asserting the truth; however, Dupri divulged that the story behind the album is about himself.\n\"Confessions Part II\" received mixed reviews from critics. The song was released as the third single from the album, following the success of \"Burn\".  The single reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, becoming the album's third consecutive number-one single. Internationally, the single had lesser success than the album's previous releases.\nWhen he started working on his fourth studio album Confessions after the release of his 2001 album 8701, Usher chose not to branch out much with musical collaborators; instead, he chose to continue creating music with his previous producers. He again enlisted producer-songwriter Jermaine Dupri, who had produced songs for Usher's two previous albums. Dupri approached Bryan-Michael Cox, asking him to become a collaborator. Cox has been a frequent partner of Dupri who had produced hits for Usher as well. Like \"Burn\", the second single from the album, Dupri and Cox conversed about a situation, creating the idea of the prospective song. However, they were concerned because they needed somebody to write such a song and they never thought Usher would do it. The concept became \"Confessions\".\nUsher started recording the song in July 2003 in New York City. One day, before the night was over, Usher was singing about impregnating a mistress and becoming displeased, having found that she is three months pregnant. The theme of cheating inspired him and Dupri, and they then decided to produce two parts of \"Confessions\": Part I and Part II. Usher said that the former is a \"dramatization where a guy confesses all the stuff he's been doing\" against his woman. The latter speaks of impregnating a mistress.\nWhile Confessions was still in production, Usher promised \"real talk\" in it. He decided \"to let it all hang out by singing about some of his own little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets.\" He explained: \"All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of.\"  He further noted that, for the most part, the album's subject matter is \"very personal\". Dupri expected people to question some of the personal lyrics they associated in the song.\n\"Confessions Part II\" was released as the third single from the album, following \"Burn\". The single was released in the United States as a 12-inch single on August 24, 2004. It was released in Germany on October 18, and Australia on October 26, 2004, featuring the album and remix version of the track and a song called \"Whatever I Want\". In the United Kingdom, it was issued as a double A-side with \"My Boo\", the fourth single from the album. The single was released in the country on November 1, 2004.\nUsher held few listening parties for the album prior to its release. Shortly after, people came up with different interpretations of \"Confessions Part II\", among other personal songs in the album. In 2003, Usher's two-year relationship with TLC's Chilli was going to \"flame-out\", which partly contributed to the concept of  \"Burn\". They finally broke up early in 2004 because of \"irreconcilable differences and because the two found it almost impossible to make compromises\" which partly triggered public speculation that some of the songs in the album are in reference to his personal struggle. They referred to the song speaking about Usher's \"infidelity\" to Chilli.\nAlongside the \"cheating\" rumors, the public inferred from the lyrics that Usher had impregnated a mistress in real life. Usher, however, emphasized that he was not in a relationship or \"got another girl pregnant\" and he was singing a \"character\". The similarity of situations he faced before and experiences of his friends collectively inspired him to write the song. In the middle of rumors, Dupri admitted that the stories behind the songs in the"

Its release coincided with Top Dawg Entertainment's announcement that its president, Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, and Lamar himself would be producing the Black Panther soundtrack album. Marvel Studios confirmed the news and revealed that Lamar was hand-picked by Black Panther's director, Ryan Coogler, to produce the soundtrack album. The song appeared in the movie during the end credits.\n\"All The Stars\" received numerous accolades and nominations including a nomination for Best Original Song at the 76th Golden Globe Awards and the 91st Academy Awards, as well as receiving four nominations at the 61st Grammy Awards including Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\"All The Stars\" won Best Song at the African-American Film Critics Association, while its video won Best Visual Effects at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.\nLamar first hinted at his involvement with the Black Panther soundtrack album in the music video for his song \"Love\", released on December 22, 2017.

I'm truly honored to contribute my knowledge of producing sound and writing music alongside Ryan and Marvel's vision.\"\n\"All The Stars\" received positive reviews from critics. Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone praised the song, calling Lamar's verse \"defiant\" and SZA's verse \"enthralling\" and \"filled with vocal turns\". However, Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork gave the song a negative review, calling it \"generic\" and \"pales in comparison to [Lamar and SZA's] recent works\". Pearce further wrote that the song is \"full of heavy-handed plotting and everyman cliches\" and is \"so nondescript that it reeks of compromise, devoid of personality or any true vision.\" Although Pearce complimented Lamar and SZA's performances and the \"slick production\", he ultimately wrote that \"'All the Stars' is uncharacteristically conservative for these two stars, all in service of a bigger picture.\"\nIn December 2018, Billboard ranked \"All The Stars\" as the 15th best song of the year.\nIn the week ending January 20, 2018, \"All The Stars\" debuted at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100.

On the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, \"All The Stars\" debuted at number 19 and stayed in the top 20 for three weeks. In its fifth week, it rose to number five on the chart.\nWorldwide, the song peaked at number one in Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and Slovakia.

The song was written by T.I., James Scheffer and David Siegel and produced by Jim Jonsin. \"Whatever You Like\" served as the third single from Paper Trail in the United Kingdom with a release date of June 1, 2009.\nThe song peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, giving T.I. his second US number one. It topped the chart for seven non-consecutive weeks, and remained in the top 3 of the charts for over 12 non-consecutive weeks. It was also number one in New Zealand and has been certified 3\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA. It was named the 16th most successful song from 2000 to 2009, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.\n\"Whatever You Like\" was written by T.I., James Scheffer and David Siegel. The song was produced by Jim Jonsin, who produced Lil Wayne's single, \"Lollipop\". The production team worked on the track when T.I. was in the studio recording his album. The instrumentals for \"Whatever You Like\" are based on a beat of lead synthesizers and drum pattern. The song runs for 4:09 and speaks about a man who can buy a woman whatever she asks for, as well encourages the woman to ask for anything she wants. A pop-rap song, contains a sample from \"Redemption\", the opening and closing theme song from the film Rocky II. \"Whatever You Like\" is set in common time with a moderately slow tempo of 80 beats per minute, and is written in the key of D minor with a chord progression sequence of Dm-Bb-F-C.\nA second version of \"Whatever You Like\" was released in order to be suitable for radio stations. The original version of the track features T.I. saying \"Late night sex so wet, it's so tight\", while the radio version replaces these lyrics with the line \"Baby I can treat you so special, so nice\" in the hook and replacing the line \"Thing gets so wet/ it hits so right\" with \"Girl, you smell so fresh, and look so nice\" in the breakdown. The line \"Tell 'em other broke niggas be quiet\" with \"Tell 'em other broke jokers be quiet\" in the pre-hook, and the 2nd verse also censors the word \"brain\" in the line \"Brain so good/ could've sworn you went to college\" due to being a slang term for oral sex. The music video uses the edited lyrics.\n\"Whatever You Like\" received generally favorable reviews. Jared W. Dillon of Sputnikmusic called the song a \"more sophisticated take\" on Lil Wayne's \"Lollipop\". Ian Cohen of Pitchfork Media noted that the song contained virtually no rapping while praising the synth-driven beat. Blender magazine ranked the song number 14 their Top 144 Songs of 2008 and number 18 on MTV's Commercially Released Hip-Hop Singles.\n\"Whatever You Like\" debuted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100. In its third week, it achieved the biggest leap to number one in Billboard Hot 100 chart history when it jumped 70 positions, from number 71 to the top of the chart, breaking the record previously held by Maroon 5's \"Makes Me Wonder\", which jumped 64 to number one. It became T.I.'s first solo Hot 100 number one of his career and his second overall following the Justin Timberlake song \"My Love\" where T.I. was a featured artist. The song's jump can be largely attributed to huge first week digital sales of 205,000, debuting at number one on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs chart. The song held the number one position on the Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks, before being replaced by Pink's \"So What.\" The following week the song knocked off \"So What\" to return to number one on the Hot 100, marking its fourth week overall at the top of the chart. It remained there for another week, marking its 5th week overall. The next week T.I. replaced himself at number one with the follow-up single \"Live Your Life\" which hadn't been done since Usher in 2004 with the first and second singles off his album (Yeah! and Burn). After spending two weeks at number two on the Hot 100, \"Whatever You Like\" again topped the chart by knocking off \"Womanizer\" by Britney Spears, marking its 6th non-consecutive week at number one on the Hot 100. This was the first time a song returned to number one on the chart after the artist's follow up single had already spent time at number one (\"Live Your Life\" having already spent a week at number one). It is also only the third song to ever have three separate runs at number one on the Hot 100, following Chic's \"Le Freak\" in 1979 and Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\" earlier in 2008.

It was released on October 11, 2011, by Atlantic Records as the lead single from the soundtrack of the film, Mac & Devin Go to High School. The track was co-written by Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine, along with Cristopher Brown, Snoop Dogg, and Wiz Khalifa. Since the track samples two other songs, \"Toot It & Boot It\" (2010) and \"Sneakin' in the Back\" (1974), songwriting credits were added for a total of seventeen. Produced by the Smeezingtons, its composition began during a Smeezingtons freestyle studio session; when progress on the song stalled, Aaron Bay-Shuck considered it a potential hit and asked them to finish it. After the song was finished, Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa were added.\n\"Young, Wild & Free\" received mixed reviews from music critics, who praised it for standing out stylistically from the rest of the soundtrack with hip-hop drums and a piano hook. Some critics praised Mars's pop-nostalgia chorus and Snoop Dogg's rap but criticized Wiz Khalifa's rap performance due to being too rough. It was commercially successful, reaching the top ten in several markets (including number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and number six in France and Switzerland); it peaked at number two in New Zealand and number four in Australia. The single was certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), five times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and one-time platinum by Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ).\nIts accompanying music video, filmed in Montclair, California in October 2011, was directed by Dylan Brown. The video features Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa having fun driving karts, skateboarding and surrounded by girls at a party, interspersed with footage from Mac & Devin Go to High School. \"Young, Wild & Free\" was performed live several times, including on the 2012 VMA Tour and at Coachella 2012. It was also part of the 2015 Boys of Zummer (the American leg of Khalifa's tour with Fall Out Boy), Dogg's 2016 Puff Puff Pass Tour Part 2, and two collaborative tours by Dogg and Khalifa: the 2011 High School Tour and the 2016 High Road Summer Tour. The song was nominated for Best Rap Song at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards in 2013, and received the Most Performed Song award at the 2013 ASCAP Pop Music Awards.\nDuring an interview in the American music magazine American Songwriter, Philip Lawrence said that \"Young, Wild & Free\" was \"an after-thought\" and \"there's a lot of fun behind it\". The song began when the Smeezingtons were experimenting in the studio, a process which usually starts when they get behind the mic and singing \"until something sticks\". Although the team thought \"it was just a little something\" which would never be heard, Aaron Bay-Shuck told them the song was a \"smash\" and they had to finish it. Mars then sent the song to Snoop Dogg, who showed it to Wiz Khalifa. They liked the track, decided to record it and returned the recording to Mars (who added finishing touches). \"Young, Wild & Free\" was first released on October 11, 2011, by Rostrum and Atlantic Records in various countries via digital download. A clean version of the song was released in various countries on October 21, 2011. On December 4, 2011, the single was liberated digitally in the United Kingdom and on February 3, 2012. It was released with its accompanying music video in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in a CD single.\n\"Young, Wild & Free\" is a pop-rap song, composed in the key of D major with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Their voice ranges from a low of B2 to a high of A4. It differs from the G-funk style of other songs by Dogg and Khalifa on the soundtrack, incorporating pop elements into the chorus. The song consists of hip-hop drums overlaid with a revolving, chilled \"twinkling\" piano hook and Mars's \"sprightly\" and \"carefree choral hook\". Its \"carefree vibes\" make the single \"the perfect soundtrack for a Friday night with friends\". Coughing is"

Written by Geoff Warburton, Scott Harris and its producers Mendes and Teddy Geiger, it was released by Island Records on March 22, 2018, as the lead single from Mendes' self-titled third studio album. It was nominated for Song of the Year at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, and won Single of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2019. \"In My Blood\" also won Choice pop song at the Teen Choice Awards.\n\"In My Blood\" chronicles Mendes' struggle with anxiety. It marks the first time the singer has publicly discussed his experiences with the mental health disorder.\nOn March 16, 2018, Mendes posted a collage on social media consisting of two uncaptioned images of blank color blocks, one in beige and one in coral. He later changed his profile picture to a beige background color with a floral design, as featured in the single's artwork.\nOn March 19, Mendes partnered with Spotify to promote the single on a billboard in New York's Times Square that reads \"Shawn Mendes coming soon\". Shortly after, he posted a video that includes two dates: March 22 and March 23. The dates were also projected in various places in London.\nHe officially announced the song on March 20, along with its release date and the single's artwork. \"This song,\" he wrote in a social media post, \"is the closest song to my heart that I've ever written\".  A Portuguese version was also released on June 3, 2018, in support of Portugal at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, owing to Mendes' Portuguese heritage.\n\"In My Blood\" is a rock and pop rock ballad, whose acoustic opening was described as \"soft and despairing\". As the song progresses, \"an insistent drum comes in\" before Mendes' voice rises on the chorus. A Rolling Stone contributor noted that the chorus features \"shuddering drums\" and \"throbbing electric guitars\", with \"choral backing vocals\" that \"add soothing textures to the final hook\". Mendes's vocals spare from A2 to C5 in this song.\nJon Caramanica from The New York Times opined it as a standout in comparison to Mendes' previous singles, referring to how \"scarred and forlorn\" he sounds while commending his songwriting ability. Hugh McIntyre of Forbes.com noted that the song is an evolution of Mendes' well-known sound, beginning with \"a familiar acoustic guitar\". He wrote that Mendes has adopted \"a more mature Kings of Leon-type sound\", calling the song \"a job well done\".\nMike Nied of Idolator opined that \"the sweeping anthem offers an intimate glimpse into his deepest thoughts\", with a radio-friendly pop rock instrumental, adding that the song \"sounds like another sure-fire smash\". He concluded by calling it \"a moving and inspiring track and a wonderful taste of things to come\". Gil Kaufman of Billboard deemed the song \"one of Mendes' most mature efforts to date\". In another Billboard article, Abby Jones listed it as his best single to date. Fuse's Jeff Benjamin praised the song's mature themes and deemed it an \"arena-rock anthem.\"\nIt debuted at number 72 on the US Billboard Hot 100 after only one day of sales and streaming tracking and four days of airplay tracking. It later rose to number 11. Mendes became the first artist to have four number-one songs on the Billboard Adult Top 40 radio airplay chart before turning 20 years old, with \"In My Blood\" being his fourth.\nIn Canada, the single debuted at 62 also after one day of tracking. The following week, it rose 53 spots to a new peak of 9, making it Mendes' fifth top 10 in his home country. It went number one in Hungary and reached the top 10 of several European and Asian countries.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"In My Blood\" debuted at Number 13 after one week of sales and fluctuated up and down the Top 20 before ultimately reaching its peak at 10 at the end of May. The song spent 13 weeks in the UK Top 40 and was Mendes' fifth top ten hit in the region.\nThe music video for the song was uploaded on April 24, 2018. Directed by Jay Martin, the video features Shawn Mendes lying on the floor barefoot, while his surroundings begin to change. As he sings, it begins to snow and rain. The video ends with a wide shot of Mendes surrounded by a garden of flowers.\nOn March 28, 2018, Mendes made a live performance debut of the song on The Late Late Show with James Corden. On April 12, Mendes performed the song live during the German Echo Music Prize. Mendes performed the song"

The track reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart on release in October 2001. Singer Gruff Rhys has described the song as being about \"rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution\".\nCritical reaction to the track was generally positive with many reviewers comparing the song to the work of other groups such as Status Quo, ELO and The Beach Boys. A promotional music video was produced to accompany \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\"'s release as a single. Directed by Pedro Romhanyi the video features images of fictional television stations including \"SFA TV\", which shows the band playing along with the track. An alternative video, directed by Sean Hillen, was included on the DVD version of Rings Around the World on its release in July 2001. This video features the lyrics to the track scrolling slowly from the bottom of the screen upwards in front of an image of a globe. The DVD version of Rings Around the World also includes a Llwybr Llaethog remix of \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\".\nAccording to lead vocalist Gruff Rhys, \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is about \"all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around. If you could visualize all the things we don't see, Earth could look like some kind of fucked-up Saturn. And that's the idea I have in my head\u00a0\u2013 surrounded by communication lines and traffic and debris thrown out of spaceships.\" Rhys has claimed that the theory was initially his girlfriend's father's. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.\n\"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is 3 minutes 29 seconds long and is in the key of B major. The track begins with feedback which plays while drums and a guitar, playing a riff based around a B chord, fade in. The first verse begins on 25 seconds with Gruff Rhys singing the lines \"You expose the film in me, we're drawing rings around the world\" backed by harmony vocals on the title phrase. A short bridge plays, during which the guitar chords change from B, E and F\u266f to just E, F\u266f, E, F\u266f. Another verse, bridge and verse play before the last bridge which begins at 1 minute 23 seconds. The outro starts at 1 minute 32 seconds with Rhys singing \"Ring ring, ring ring, rings around the world\" over the chords B, D and F\u266f backed by harmony vocals. A guitar counter-melody begins at 2 minutes 2 seconds and excerpts from phone calls the band made to random people around the world, including calls to the United States embassies in Madagascar and Moscow, a record shop in Osaka and a record company in Australia, play as the track fades out.\nA Llwybr Llaethog remix of \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is included on the DVD version of Rings Around The World. The track is 3 minutes 33 seconds in length and begins with a reed organ playing a riff in the key of B major. The remix largely follows the arrangement of the original but, for the majority of its duration, dispenses with the instrumental backing, featuring just Gruff Rhys's main vocals, the band's backing vocals and excerpts from the random phonecalls the group made alongside occasional organ and cymbals. Towards the end of the track the original version's guitar, drums and bass appear briefly before the song ends with the same reed organ riff that appeared at the start.\nCritical reaction to \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" was generally positive with many journalists comparing the song to the work of other groups. Writing for the NME, Ted Kessler described the track as \"Status Quo for Generation X-ers with a Manhattan Portage full of millennial tension\" and went on to ask \"who said there was anything wrong with that?\" in his review of the song on its release as a single, despite his earlier review of Rings Around the World claiming that the album would benefit from the removal of the \"Status Quo-ish title track\". Q described the track as \"excellent\" while PopMatters claimed the song \"sounds so much like ELO that it blows away everything on last year's ELO reunion album\" and the Dallas Observer stated that \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is a \"Beach"

It was the first single to be taken from the Rings Around the World album and reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart on its release in July 2001. The song was initially conceived as a duet but, after both Brian Harvey and Bobby Brown turned the band down, lead singer Gruff Rhys sang the entire track, using a vocoder on the verses to imitate another person. Musically \"Juxtapozed with U\" has echoes of Philadelphia soul and the \"plastic soul\" of David Bowie's album Young Americans and was inspired by the Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder track \"Ebony and Ivory\". Rhys has claimed that he sees \"Juxtapozed with U\" as \"fairly subversive\" because its polished pop style was in stark contrast to the \"macho\" guitar music the band felt was prevalent in 2001.\nCritical reaction to the track was generally positive with some reviewers describing it as the band's best single to date. A promotional music video was produced to accompany \"Juxtapozed with U\"'s release as a single. Directed by Dawn of the New Assembly/H5 the video features a computer generated woman and man seen as thermal images. The couple drive around New York City and attend a party on the top floor of a skyscraper which is enveloped in flames towards the end of the track. An alternative video, directed by Fukme 99, was included on the DVD version of Rings Around the World. This video features three people walking through the streets of Hammersmith, dressed in cardboard costumes as a camcorder, clapperboard and microphone. The characters meet up with a fourth person wearing a large cardboard head and arms and then dance with several other people dressed in cardboard outside a group of warehouse. The DVD version of Rings Around the World also includes two remixes of \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" by Lesser and the Super Furry Animals themselves.\n\"Juxtapozed with U\" was inspired by the Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder track \"Ebony and Ivory\" as well as the work of Marvin Gaye and Caetano Veloso. The track was originally conceived as a duet, with the band approaching both Brian Harvey from East 17, and Bobby Brown to sing alongside Gruff Rhys. Both turned the band down so Rhys sang the verses through a vocoder to imitate another person, something which he has described as a \"very schizophrenic thing to do\". Rhys has claimed his lyrics address social injustice and are about \"house prices going up, and people being left behind by the super rich\". The song has echoes of the Philadelphia soul music of the 1970s as well as David Bowie's \"plastic\" approximation of the sound on his 1975 album Young Americans. The group tried to make the song as \"plastic\" as possible: \"if we'd tried to make it sound authentic, it would have been awful.\" According to Rhys the band were keen to challenge people's opinions of them with the track which is a \"shocking song, because you can't shock with loud guitars any more\" and, as a polished uplifting pop song, is \"fairly subversive\" when contrasted with the macho guitar music which the band felt was prevalent in 2001. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.\n\"Juxtapozed with U\" is 3 minutes 8 seconds long and is in the key of A major. The track begins with a drum fill, featuring flanging, before a harp, strings, acoustic guitar and bass join at 2 seconds. An electric guitar joins at 13 seconds playing a melody line. The song breaks down at 25 seconds for the first verse with just bass, drums, acoustic guitar and occasional synthesizer accompanying Gruff Rhys's vocals which are fed through a vocoder. The first chorus begins at 47 seconds with the strings and harp re-entering while Rhys sings the words \"You've got to tolerate all those people that you hate, I'm not in love with you but I won't hold that against you\" twice without the use of a vocoder. The song breaks down again for the second verse after which the second chorus enters at 1 minute 33 seconds. The outro begins at 1 minute 58 seconds with Rhys singing \"Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed, just suppose I'm juxtaposed with you\" supported by harmony backing vocals. The rest of the band continue singing these words while Rhys begins singing the chorus lyrics, starting at 2 minutes 43 seconds. The track ends with Rhys singing the words \"Let's get juxtaposed\" backed only by harmony vocals.\nTwo remixes of \"Juxtapozed with U\" are included on the"

It is the opening track from their 2011 studio album El Camino and was released as the record's lead single on October 26, 2011. The song is also the A-side of a promotional 12-inch single that was released in commemoration of Record Store Day's \"Back to Black\" Friday event. The single was accompanied by a popular one-shot music video of a man dancing and lip-synching the lyrics.\n\"Lonely Boy\" became one of the group's most successful singles. It topped several rock radio charts, including the Alternative Songs and Rock Songs charts in the US, and the Alternative Rock and Active Rock charts in Canada. On the singles charts, \"Lonely Boy\" was the group's highest-charting song in several countries, peaking at number 64 on the Billboard Hot 100, number two on the Australian Singles Chart, and number 33 on the Canadian Hot 100. At the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, the song won awards for Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song, while also receiving a nomination for Record of the Year.\n\"Lonely Boy\" is 3:13 in length. The song was written by Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney with producer Danger Mouse. The song is played in the key of E minor, with only three chords used throughout the song. \"Lonely Boy\" is set in the time signature of common time with a varying tempo of 164-168 beats per minute. According to Auerbach, the guitar riff was inspired by Johnny Burnette's cover of \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\". The guitar line features a dive bomb although Auerbach uses a Boss Super Shifter pedal to achieve the effect.\n\nThe promotional music video for \"Lonely Boy\" features actor, musician and part-time security guard Derrick T. Tuggle dancing and lip-syncing to the song in front of the Pepper Tree Motel in North Hollywood, a neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The video, shot in a single take, went viral and garnered more than 400,000 views on YouTube within 24 hours. The video originally had a script and a cast of more than 40 people, but the group was not pleased with the results. Auerbach said, \"A couple of weeks after we shot it they sent us the edit and it was awful. We sent it back... they sent us another edit and it was terrible. That's when we said 'what about that one guy, the extra who had that one dance scene' and that's the video \u2013 the most expensive single shot ever recorded.\" Tuggle was originally cast as an extra who would be handed a set of keys to the band's motel room by Auerbach and Carney. While on set, Tuggle's improvised dancing drew the attention of director Jesse Dylan. He said, \"The director just sort of noticed me dancing and asked me, 'Can you perform?' I said, 'I can dance, anybody can dance,' so I took some moves from everybody: John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction, the Carlton Banks dance from The Fresh Prince and a little bit of Michael Jackson, so it was a smorgasbord of everybody in there.\" He added, \"It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing. My acting teacher Mark McPherson, he has us do this thing before we start class called 'Song and Dance,' where he'll have us sing one of our favorite songs, and then while we're singing it, he'll have us do a crazy dance, or a sexy dance, and I guess it spawned from that.\" The video was nominated for a 2012 MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video. Tuggle's performance later earned him a cameo appearance in the music video for \"Happy\" by Pharrell Williams.\nThe cover of the single release features an image of a bulldozer sitting on an empty tract of land. The lot was previously filled by the factory at which the group's 2004 album Rubber Factory was recorded. Michael Carney, the group's art director, went to take a photo of the factory but found that it had been demolished. Auerbach joked about the cover's significance: \"We keep stumbling into these profound artistic expressions. That's how we roll though.\"\n\"Lonely Boy\" became one of the group's most successful singles. It topped several rock radio charts, including the Alternative Songs and Rock Songs charts in the US (the second such Black Keys song to top both), and the Alternative Rock and Active Rock charts in Canada. On the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, it has become their highest-charting song, peaking at number five. On the singles charts, it became the band's highest-charting song in several countries, reaching a peak of number 64 on the US Billboard Hot 100 (which beats the number 87 peak achieved by 2010's \"Tighten Up\"),"

It features guest vocals from American singer Jason Derulo, who co-wrote the song with Jez Ashurst, Emma Rohan, and Tich. It was also produced by Jayson DeZuzio. The group's cover of Derulo's 2015 single \"Want to Want Me\" performed in BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge back in the same year inspired him to collaborate with them. \"Secret Love Song\" is a slow ballad comprising pounding bass and melancholic strings. The song's lyrics, which discuss unrequited and forbidden love, have been interpreted in different ways, including as an anthem for the LGBT community, while Derulo's verse details his personal experience of having an affair.\nThe song was announced as the third single from Get Weird released on 3 February 2016 in Ireland and the UK. It was met with mixed reviews from music critics, nevertheless reached number six on the UK Singles Chart, and charted in several other countries including Australia, Ireland and the Philippines. An accompanying music video was directed by Frank Borin and filmed in London near Tower Bridge. A ballad version of the song, titled \"Secret Love Song, Pt II\", was later included on the deluxe edition of Get Weird.\nIn July 2015, Little Mix member Jesy Nelson said that the group's third studio album, Get Weird, would have a song \"that is possibly going to be a single that we've never done anything like before\". Group member Perrie Edwards added: \"And it may or may not have a feature....\" The track, \"Secret Love Song\", was written by Jez Ashurst, Emma Rohan and Tich, and produced by Jayson DeZuzio. The group then sent the song to Jason Derulo who positively reacted to it, writing his own verse. Recording took place at Poinsettia Place in Los Angeles and at Blue Box Studios in London.\nDerulo's decision to collaborate with the group was influenced by a string of events; Hit 30 presenters Angus O'Loughlin and Ash London played him the group's cover of his 2015 single \"Want to Want Me\" for BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge in July 2015. He reacted: \"I was into that, man\", and said he understood why the cover became a viral video. However, Derulo was unfamiliar with the group's music at the time and had to \"research\" their discography which he ultimately became fond of. Group member Jade Thirlwall felt the song's slow tempo was \"a nice change\" for Derulo and \"[showed] his voice off a lot\". A piano-driven solo sequel of the song, \"Secret Love Song Pt. II\", was included on the deluxe version of Get Weird.\n\"Secret Love Song\" is a slow, pop ballad. It comprises of a pounding bass and melancholic strings. Derulo's vocal uses vibrato and auto-tune, as he sings the song's second verse. Nelson sings the high note during its bridge.\nLyrically, \"Secret Love Song\" details unrequited and forbidden love. Edwards said the lyrics are about \"being with someone and you want to scream it from the rooftops but you have to hold it in\". According to Derulo, his verse serves as a \"twist\" in the song, discussing his personal experience of having an affair: \"I told a true story about this girl that I am really into but she has a boyfriend but we still do our thing.\" Some commentators have interpreted the song as representing the struggles of LGBT couples who cannot display affection in public and has been referred to as an unintentional gay anthem by fans of the group. This sentiment was shared by Jade Thirlwall who reacted positively to gay fans of the group interpreting that message in the song.\nThe group revealed the song's title on 7 September 2015, on Instagram. On 13 October 2015, they announced Derulo's involvement on Twitter, ahead of Get Weird's release the following month. The song was first made available as part of the album when Get Weird was released on 6 November 2015. On 5 December 2015, Little Mix confirmed on Twitter that \"Secret Love Song\" would be the third single from the album in the UK and Ireland. They unveiled the single's cover art on Instagram on 8 January 2016.\n\n\"Secret Love Song\" has received mixed reviews from music critics. Popjustice wrote that the song would be better without Derulo, but called it \"a big ballad\" with an \"amazing\" chorus and gave it a rating of seven out of ten. Brad O'Mance from the website disliked Derulo's \"dulcet/song-ruining tones\". Lewis Corner of"

It was released as a digital download on 8 October 2012, by PMR Records. The lead single from their debut studio album, Settle (2013), the song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 26 and peaked at number 11. In the United States, \"Latch\" was a sleeper hit, peaking at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 in August 2014.\nOriginally, Disclosure thought that \"Latch\" was \"too weird for the radio and not clubby enough for the clubs\" because of its time signature. The band stated: \"It's in 6/8 time \u2014 not even 4/4, the more commonly used time signature for house music.\" When first hearing Sam Smith's voice, Disclosure thought they were a woman and later were \"amazed\" that they were not.\nHoward has stated that Disclosure is \"trying to bring some soul into the songwriting... using jazz chords and interesting melodies instead of boring, stabby EDM triads.\" According to the sheet music published at MusicNotes.com, \"Latch\" is composed in the key of F minor with a tempo of 122 beats per minute.\nMichael Cragg of The Guardian wrote of the song: \"it's a slowly unravelling ode to the thrill of wanting to figuratively (and possibly literally) latch on to someone else.\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times viewed the track as one of the duo's \"least characteristic\" songs, describing it as \"less relaxed, more ambitious, more blatantly pop-oriented, with full-bodied vocals\". Jamieson Cox lauded the song in The Verge: \"Latch\" is a \"song that remains this decade\u2019s prototypical piece of dance-pop. There\u2019s no such thing as a perfect song, but 'Latch' comes close: it\u2019s economic, beguiling, and precise.\"\nOn 10 October 2012, Greg James announced that \"Latch\" was at number 39 on The Official Chart Update, officially entering the UK Singles Chart at number 26 on 14 October 2012, climbing 13 places during the course of the week. In its second week, the song climbed nine places to number 17 and in its third climbed five places to number 12; it eventually peaked at number 11 in its fourth week. The song spent a total of 15 weeks within the top 40 and 32 weeks within the top 75. The song has sold over 1,200,000 copies in the UK alone, with it being certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the BPI. This puts \"Latch\" among the best-selling singles to not reach the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart. The single was also certified Gold by the Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana.\nIn 2014, \"Latch\" became a sleeper hit in the United States. The song was released as their debut single in the United States on 4 February 2014. On the chart dated 2 August, it topped the Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart during its forty-seventh week on the chart, marking the longest trip to the summit of that chart (where it remained through the chart dated 30 August). Having sold 990,000 units at the mid-way point of 2014, \"Latch\" reigned as one of the top-selling Dance/Electronic Songs according to Nielsen SoundScan. The song became a contemporary hit radio crossover-hit. It was the duo's first, and Smith's second, top 10 single at pop, adult pop, rhythmic, urban and urban AC radio in the US, peaking at numbers three, 10, three and nine respectively.

It was produced by Pharrell Williams, who also provided backing vocals. The song was released by Asylum Records UK on 7 April 2014 as the lead single from Sheeran's second studio album, \u00d7 (2014). \"Sing\" became Sheeran's first UK number-one single and also topped the charts in Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. It peaked at number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\"Sing\" was written by Sheeran and Pharrell Williams, and produced by the latter. Williams also provides uncredited background vocals during the chorus. The song has a length of 3 minutes and 55 seconds. The song, which has pop and R&B influences and was inspired by Justin Timberlake, is a departure from the folk rock sound Sheeran became known for on his previous album, +. Sheeran was inspired to model the song after the pop and R&B stylings of Timberlake, stating \"It was pretty close to a direct inspiration. I love Justified and FutureSex/LoveSounds, so I took inspiration from those.\" The lyrics are about \"a night out in Vegas.\"\n\"Sing\" was released in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and Germany in May 2014. Aside from these nations, \"Sing\" was released internationally on 7 April 2014, during a YouTube live chat with Sheeran. \"Friends\", a track from the EP, entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 121.\nThe song received critical acclaim upon release; music critics complimented Sheeran's change of sound, and likened the song to the works of Justin Timberlake. Time gave the song a very positive review, saying that it is \"more of a departure. It fits the times nicely: there's some of fellow Brit, Sam Smith, in Sheeran's rubbery falsetto, plus some of Robin Thicke's ubiquitous 'Blurred Lines' in the percussion. But Sheeran's really got his heavy-breathing, hyper-flirtatious sights on another, older target: Justin Timberlake's solo debut, 'Like I Love You'.\" The chorus riff and falsetto are from \"Miss You\" by The Rolling Stones.\nIn a positive review, The Guardian said that \"while Pharrell's influence is writ large, there's enough of Sheeran there to prevent it coming across as horrible pastiche.\" The Hollywood Reporter also gave the song a positive review, stating that \"Sheeran's fragile voice, as heard on past hits like 'The A Team' and 'Lego House,' has now morphed into a confident croon, unafraid of diving into a deep bag of melismas, boisterous chants and rapid-fire rhymes in order to convince his female subject of his desires.\"\nThe song debuted at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart and Irish Singles Chart, giving him his first ever number-one singles in both the United Kingdom and Ireland. The song has sold 670,000 copies in actual sales in the United Kingdom, which together with 66 million in streams give a combine total units of 1,339,000.\n\"Sing\" debuted at No. 1 on the Australian ARIA Charts in May 2014, making it Sheeran's first ever number-one in the country, and his sixth top ten single in Australia. On the week of 14 April 2014, the song entered the New Zealand Singles Chart at No. 8, becoming his fourth top 10 single and second top 10 debut in New Zealand. The song has since topped the charts in that country, giving Sheeran his second consecutive number-one single there. In Italy, \"Sing\" has peaked at No. 2 and spent five total weeks at this position, giving him the higher peak position reached in the country, so far.\nIn Canada, the track has since peaked at No. 4, giving Sheeran his first ever top 10 hits in the country. \"Sing\" debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Sheeran his highest-charting single in the United States, at the time. The single managed to sell 123,000 copies, giving him his second best sales week digitally; the song also managed to net 563,000 streams and earn 28 million in audience impressions, all before its debut week on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Sing\" has since peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.  The song reached its million sales mark in the US in July 2014, and has sold 1,323,000 copies as of January 2015.\nThe music video for \"Sing\" was released exclusively to Sheeran's Facebook page on 22 May 2014, and added to Vevo and YouTube on 23 May, exactly a month before the album was released. It follows a puppet caricature of Sheeran on a night out, during which he gets drunk, steals a mic (from actor Peter Kwong from Big Trouble in Little China) and sings karaoke, goes to a strip club and picks up Sheeran and Pharrell from a studio in his truck. Throughout the video Sheeran is seen playing his guitar in front of an optical illusion-esque backdrop.\nThe"

It was written by Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris, Gillian Gilbert, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers while the production was done by the last two. Released as the album's second single, the song was solicited to the US radios on June 12, 2007 and was physically released on August 27, 2007, in the UK.  \"Shut Up and Drive\" is a new wave song which heavily incorporates 1970s and 1980s musical styles. Lyrically, it contains multiple references to cars and car parts including the '57 Cadillac.\n\"Shut Up and Drive\" was received with mixed reviews from music critics, who labeled its lyrics as fluffy and goofy. The song peaked at number 15 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and at number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. On the UK Singles Chart, it reached number five, becoming Rihanna's fifth top-five single. \"Shut Up and Drive\" peaked within the top 10 in nine other countries, including in Australia, Canada, Germany and Italy. Its accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler and was shot in Prague, Czech Republic. It features Rihanna in a makeshift junkyard. Rihanna performed \"Shut Up and Drive\" on the Good Girl Gone Bad (2007\u201309), Last Girl on Earth (2010\u201311) and Loud (2011) concert tours.\n\"Shut Up and Drive\" was produced by Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers, and its composition is credited to  Sturken and Rogers as well as the members of New Order (Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert), whose 1983 song \"Blue Monday\" forms a partial basis for the song. Al Hemberger recorded the song at Sunwatch in Saint James, Barbados and The Loft Recording Studios in Bronxville, New York. Hemberger also served as a mixing engineer and mixed \"Shut Up and Drive\" at The Loft Recording Studios, together with mixing assistant Roy Matthews. Sturken provided all of the instrumentation while Rihanna and Rogers sang the background vocals. The production manager of the song was Rob Heselden with Christie Moran serving as a production assistant. \"Shut Up and Drive\" was released as the second single from the album, following the worldwide chart-topper \"Umbrella\" (2007). The song premiered on Tuesday, May 22, 2007, on Rihanna's official website. It was sent to contemporary hit radio in the United States on June 12 and to rhythmic radio the following week. The single was later released as a CD single on August 27, 2007 in the UK.\n\"Shut Up and Drive\" is a new wave song that incorporates influences of the 1970s and 1980s musical styles. It samples New Order's 1983 single \"Blue Monday\". The song contains an upbeat opening sequence with a heavy guitar riff. Tom Breihan from Pitchfork Media wrote that the song \"begins with \u00fcber-processed new wave guitars that sort of sound like the Cars\". According to a digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, \"Shut Up and Drive\" is written in the key of C\u266f major and is set in simple time with a moderately fast groove. Rihanna's vocal range spans from the low note of F#3 to the high note of B\u2084 and the song follows a chord progression of E\u2013B\u2013C\u266f\u2013F\u266f\u2013B\u2013C\u266f. Lyrically, \"Shut Up and Drive\", as the title suggests, is about Rihanna looking for a \"driver\", having nothing to do with the cars' performance described being thinly veiled metaphors for her and the driver as for a lover capable to handle them. The lyrics also contain multiple references to various cars and car parts, including 'class like a '57 Cadillac', all about her own attributes.\n\"Shut Up and Drive\" received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. Bill Lamb from About.com commented that there are better songs on Good Girl Gone Bad, but \"Shut Up and Drive\" captures \"the spirit of summer just as well as Rihanna's first hit 'Pon de Replay'\". Lamb further continued, \"The lyrics are pure fluff, and the vocals have the now familiar thin and reedy quality common to many of Rihanna's efforts. However, like any successful sports car, the look, feel, and speed of 'Shut Up and Drive' pull you in despite the model's shortcomings.\" Quentin B. Huff from PopMatters wrote that \"Shut Up and Drive\" is a sassier version of Aretha Franklin's \"Freeway of Love\" and Michael Jackson's \"Speed Demon\". He also stated that the song would have fit comfortably on Gwen Stefani's"

The single was originally set to be released on 25 November 2015, but was postponed to 3 December. The song was highly successful, peaking in the top 10 in most of the countries. It charted in, and reached the top spot in more than 10 countries. As of July 2021, it is the 20th most viewed video on YouTube and also 13th most viewed music video, with over 3 billion views, making it the first EDM track to hit that milestone. \"Faded\" is also the 45th most streamed song on Spotify as of July\u00a02021, with over 1.4 billion streams.\nWalker debuted a live performance of \"Faded\" with Solheim and string support on 27 February 2016 at the X Games in Oslo. The performance was aired live on Norwegian television.\nThe song \"Faded\" is a revamped version of Walker's past composition \"Fade\", which was released via the record label NoCopyrightSounds in 2014.\nIn the creation of \"Faded\", Walker was inspired by the music producer Ahrix's sound on his track \"Nova\" from 2013. In an interview he stated: \"The melodies and the way the track progresses are what's so unique and its what inspired me to create 'Fade' which later on became 'Faded'\". The style is inspired by the Norwegian producer K-391. The melody, I don't know where it came from, but I try to let my emotions and feelings have a big influence on the melodies I produce.\"\nWhile the structure and melody are almost identical to \"Fade\", \"Faded\" is noticeably different for its piano intro and outro; with uncredited vocals by Iselin Solheim and mainstream production.\nThe song is set in common time and has a tempo of 90 beats per minute. It is written in the key of E\u266d minor with a chord progression of E\u266dm\u2013C\u266d-G\u266d\u2013D\u266d.\n\"Faded\" became a worldwide commercial success upon its release, topping Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish singles charts, as well as entering the top 3 in the Danish singles chart.\nThe song peaked at number one in more than ten countries and in the top 5 in more than 25 countries.\nIt also charted in various countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It also reached number one on the Shazam Worldwide Top 100 Popular Songs in February 2016, and by March 2016, had become the world's most Shazamed song.\nIts music video on YouTube reached 1 billion views on 26 March 2017, and has received over 3 billion views to date, making it the 21st most viewed YouTube video. It is also the 6th most liked YouTube video with over 23 million likes.\nSeveral female vocalists have performed the song live: Iselin Solheim, the original vocalist on the recording, Ingrid Helene H\u00e5vik (vocalist of Highasakite), Tove Styrke, Alexandra Rotan, Angelina Jordan, Zara Larsson and Torine Michelle.\nOn 4 November 2017 Alan Walker performed the song live with Against the Current at the 2017 League of Legends World Championship closing ceremony in Beijing.\nA music video was released, featuring Shahab Salehi as the protagonist. It was produced and edited by Bror Bror and directed by Rikkard and Tobias H\u00e4ggbom; Rikkard H\u00e4ggbom served as director of photography. \nOn September 24, 2021, a new music video called Paradise was released on YouTube with collaboration with K-391 and Boy in Space. That music video takes place at the same time as Faded, with it becoming part of the World of Walker (WoW) Universe, as it uncovers a deeper plot within the previous music video Faded, serving as the follow-up, and spin-off of both the WoW, and Faded.\nThe video shows a young man dressed in scruffy clothes and covering his face, roaming with his backpack and a photograph of his home in his hand. He wanders through  devastated high rises and derelict structures in an abandoned town, wielding a flare to explore a dark building. Guided by the photo, he finally locates his home, which lies in ruins. With a final look at his home, he removes his mask, and the video fades to black.\nThe video was filmed in Estonia at such locations as the Linnahall building; a disused textile manufacturing plant and a concert hall in Tallinn; the former Rummu prison; the Rummu quarry and lake alongside the adjoining spoil tip in Vasalemma Parish; and the city of Paldiski. The last shot features the ruins of a building near the shore on Pakri Peninsula just outside Paldiski, on the outskirts of"

It was written and produced by Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory, with additional production by Richard X. The song was released on 7 June 2010 as the album's second single. The single failed to chart on the UK Singles Chart, while becoming Goldfrapp's fifth single to top the Hot Dance Club Songs chart in the United States.\n\"Alive\" received positive reviews from music critics. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy stated, \"Beginning with a piano riff reminiscent of vintage Elton, 'Alive' builds towards a fantastic arms-in-the-air chorus on which Goldfrapp proclaims 'I'm feeling alive again' over gorgeously warm 80s-style synths.\" Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote that the song \"channels ABBA with percolating guitars, warm keyboards and synths that sparkle like falling stars or a shower of glitter.\" Peter Paphides of The Times referred to \"Alive\" as Billy Joel's 1980 song \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" as if \"marinaded in amyl nitrate and recast to lyrics that sound like a great lost Brutus jeans jingle.\"\nBBC Music reviewer Ian Wade felt that \"while 'Alive' initially echoes The Feeling, it soon expands into a broader wonder evocative of ELO's most-imperial phase.\" Barry Nicolson of NME noted that the track \"treads along on an infuriatingly familiar-sounding piano hook modernised by Gregory's whip-smart production.\" Andy Gill of The Independent opined that \"the Elton-esque piano chords of 'Alive' [...] recall the indulgent, bogus innocence of 1970s AOR pop excess with Spandex-tight accuracy.\" Spin magazine's Lindsey Thomas commented that the song \"wears its influences proudly, flaunting the shimmery squiggles that denoted muse-y magic in Xanadu.\"\n\nImpressed by their work on the music video for Florence and the Machine's song \"Dog Days Are Over\", Alison asked the direction duo Legs to produce a script for the song \"Alive\". Legs decided to create a dark video featured in a demonic world because \"Alive\" is \"so infectiously happy and bright.\" The video was inspired by heavy metal bands and the music video for Olivia Newton-John's song \"Physical\". \nThe video was filmed over one day. The morning was dedicated to filming the dancers and extras, while the afternoon focused on Goldfrapp's stage performance. Ross McLennan, the director of photography, experimented with different styles of lighting to give the video an \"incredible energy.\" Special effects such as laser beams, blood and fang transformation were added in post-production by Absolute Post in New York City.\nThe main idea behind the video is that Alison is a 1980s-inspired aerobics instructor who leads a group of black metal fans and vampires through a fitness routine. The video begins with Alison standing in a dark room with smoke rising around her. In front of her are a group of men (the black metal fans) standing in a pentagram wearing black hooded capes. As the music begins to pick up, the men take off their capes and begin to dance.\nAfter the chorus, Alison shoots white laser beams from her fingertips, summoning a group of female dancers to join the dancing group of goth men. As the video progresses, Alison uses further power to make the female dancers, who are actually vampires, attack the dancing metalheads and consume their rainbow-coloured blood. Throughout this, Alison continues to sing and dance, urging the vampires to continue to perform the aerobics routine. The video ends with Alison drinking some of the blood, revealing a pair of vampire fangs and laying down in a neon coffin.\nDigital download \u2013 Remixes\n\"Alive\" \u2013 3:28\n\"Alive\" (Joakim Remix) \u2013 6:31\n\"Alive\" (Joakim NRG Dub) \u2013 6:14\n\"Alive\" (Tensnake Remix) \u2013 7:23\n\"Alive\" (Dave Aud\u00e9 Remix) \u2013 7:57\n\"Alive\" (Arno Cost Remix) \u2013 8:24\nUK limited-edition shaped 7-inch picture disc\nA. \"Alive\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:00\nB. \"Alive\" (Joakim Remix Edit) \u2013 3:55\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Head First.\nMixed at The Mix Suite UK (London)\nMastered at Sterling Sound (New York City)\nAlison Goldfrapp \u2013 vocals, recording, production\nWill Gregory \u2013 recording, production\nMark \"Spike\" Stent \u2013 mixing\nMatty Green \u2013 mixing assistance\nRichard X \u2013 additional production\nTim Goldsworthy \u2013 additional programming\nGreg Freeman \u2013 drum recording\nNick Batt \u2013 additional programming\nBruno Ellingham \u2013 additional engineering\nTed Jensen \u2013 mastering\nAlex Lee \u2013 guitar\nCharlie Jones \u2013 bass\nChris Goulston \u2013 guitar\nGed Lynch \u2013 drums\n\n\n\nCopsey, Robert (7 June 2010). \"Goldfrapp: 'Alive'\".

Group member Mollie King explained to the Daily Star how the group came to record it instead:\nWe heard the song playing while at our record company and went into the office where James was talking to the head of the label. We said: 'We have to have that song!' Then we found out that Kelly Clarkson was fighting for it but he gave it to us. James is lovely.\n The song was also wanted by American pop rock artist P!nk.\nThe single was accompanied by a B-side entitled \"I Can't Wait\" which was co-written by the Saturdays together with Hannah Robinson and producers Ben Macklin, Julian Peake and Richard Stannard.

Magazine labelled the song as \"An infectious synth pop tune\". Muumuse.com had the following to say: \"Radio-friendly doesn't even begin to describe it - the chorus is simply massive.\" TheChemistryIsDead.com described \"Forever Is Over\" as \"Rockier than their other stuff but it's very sleek and polished.\" WessexScene.co.uk reviewed the single as \"A sophisticated more pop rock breakaway from the girls' previous pure pop style and has a more transatlantic feel to it\" further saying that \"It is vocally impressive.\"\nEntertainment-focus.com reviewed the lead single as \"A slow-building pop stormer and that all five girls sharing vocals adds a harder edge to their normally polished pop sound.\" Whilst Yahoo! Music's view of track included it having \"Sultry verses and a full throttle chorus which suggests a new, more sophisticated direction to put them on par with their rivals.\"\nUna Healy takes the first verse and the middle 8 in the song. The first bridge is shared by Rochelle Wiseman and Mollie King, while the chorus is sung by Vanessa White. The second verse is sung by Wiseman as the second bridge is sung by Frankie Sandford and White. White also closes the song.\nThe single was also performed at various British music festivals and on various"

Tour. The band also appeared on Dancing on Ice, GMTV and Blue Peter.\nIn an interview with HitQuarters, Steve Mac described how he, Ina Wroldsen and Rhys Barker created the track together,\n\"We were searching for sounds and found the basic hook sound that's in the verse and carries all the way through. I started playing along to it and then Ina started singing along, and the song was written over that. No drums were ever put down. Once we finished writing the song together, Ina laid a guide vocal over the top of the keyboard sound and then went away and left me and Rhys to do the rest of it. So it really was built from that sound. It's an Eurythmics kind of sound.\"\nMac also acknowledged the influence of producer RedOne's work with Lady Gaga, \"There's no question that without Gaga we wouldn't be where we are at the moment, with what Red has done and how he has changed radio in America, and what's acceptable, and where dance is.\" \"Ego\" follows a chord progression of: Bm-G-D-Bm-G.\nOn 12 October 2009, \"Ego\" was revealed on BBC Radio 1 as the Saturdays' seventh official single and the second and final official single to be released from their second studio album Wordshaker which was released on the same date.

The band decided that \"Ego\" would be the final single from their second studio album. Rochelle Wiseman backed the album by saying \"We are not releasing any more singles from the album, as we want to release a new album, not because there is no more good songs on the album.\" as there were people questioning the album's songs.\nCarla Pearce of FemaleFirst mentioned that the single \"Combines infectious synthesised riffs with a thumping beat to create a riot of a track that will no doubt become another smash hit.\" Nick Levine of Digital Spy award the song 3/5 stars describing the chorus as \"catchy enough\". UpdateTheBeat stated that \"Ego\" was a \"women-empowerment\" and it has the potential to be a number-one single! They went on to say, \"The heavy beat is the first thing to strike you, as the girls warble away chanting: \"You need to have a sit down with your ego!\" If I was to describe the song in one word it would have to be- confident.

CONFIDENT- oh that was three...\" They also went on to say that the girls have \"clearly matured\" and became more \"willing to be more deep in their songs\", he always stated the Vanessa stole the song with her powerful vocals. And finally stated that \"Ego\" is definitely the stand out track on the album. DirrtyRemixes.com stated that the single is \"amazing\" and \"just can't stop playing it!\" They also gave their views over the B-side, saying that the song is not the best song, but it has good potential.

The video for the song was directed by Jonas & Fran\u00e7ois, and is featured on Higher Than the Eiffel, Ibiza Fever 2010, Global Gathering Festival Anthems, Clubbers Guide to Festivals and the similarly titled single from the band.\nThe song was described by Max Feldman of PopMatters as being a \"sizable club banger\" while Lou Thomas of BBC Online goes on to characterize the tune as a \"triumph of metallic guitar-ish samples, understated sax riffs and thumping Lo-Fidelity Allstars-echoing grooves\" and that \"Two tunes in and the motivation is clear: stop what you\u2019re doing and dance\".  Alex Young of Consequence of Sound called it \"a hit with an extremely creative and colorful video\" with Joe Barton of The Skinny alludes to the \"testosterone fuelled house\" with an \"incessant stomp\".\nLizz Paige of Future Radio describes the tune as having a \"thumping beat reminiscent of Daft Punk\" but being \"slightly too slow to dance to\" with \"complex and syncopated rhythms, vocals like Ian Brown and simple and repetitive lyrics that compound further the heaviness of the track\", comparing the song to those of Gorillaz.\nContrarily, Ben Hogwood of musicOMH states that with the composition, the duo \"take their urban \u2018geezerness\u2019 too far, and end up with songs that don\u2019t say very much\", but continues to express that \"it stands out simply because the rest of the album is strong, and at times affecting\".\nThe music video, directed by Jonas & Fran\u00e7ois and produced by Jules Dieng of El Ni\u00f1o won the 2010 UK Music Video Awards for \"Best Visual Effects\" in a Video in association with BEAM.\n\n\nOnly Man (Album Version) - 3:21\nOnly Man (Reset!

I started playing along to it and then Ina started singing along, and the song was written over that. No drums were ever put down. Once we finished writing the song together, Ina laid a guide vocal over the top of the keyboard sound and then went away and left me and Rhys to do the rest of it. So it really was built from that sound. It's an Eurythmics kind of sound.\"\nMac also acknowledged the influence of producer RedOne's work with Lady Gaga, \"There's no question that without Gaga we wouldn't be where we are at the moment, with what Red has done and how he has changed radio in America, and what's acceptable, and where dance is.\" \"Ego\" follows a chord progression of: Bm-G-D-Bm-G.\nOn 12 October 2009, \"Ego\" was revealed on BBC Radio 1 as the Saturdays' seventh official single and the second and final official single to be released from their second studio album Wordshaker which was released on the same date.

Written and produced by the band alongside Henrik Jonback, the song was conceived when lead singer Andrew Wyatt felt like a tyrant while in a long-distance relationship, comparing his cruelty to that of Mongolian emperor Genghis Khan. Wyatt did not want to commit to the relationship, while simultaneously not wanting her being involved with anybody else. Wyatt believed the public could relate to this irrational jealousy, recognizing it as a truth of human nature. Musically, \"Genghis Khan\" is an electropop song with funk and R&B influences and lyrics which see the protagonist likening his jealousy to the behavior of the Mongolian emperor.\n\"Genghis Khan\" was released as iii's second single on 3 December 2015 through Jackalope and Atlantic. It attracted generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom regarded it a focal point on iii and commended its catchiness, although some critiqued its subject matter. Commercially, it is among the band's most successful singles and appeared on several Billboard charts, achieving its highest peak at number six on Alternative Songs. \"Genghis Khan\" became Miike Snow's first song to chart in their native Sweden, peaking at number eight on the Heatseeker chart. The single also peaked at number 86 in Canada, where it was certified gold, and at number 44 in Australia.\nThe accompanying music video for \"Genghis Khan\", directed by Ninian Doff, depicts a love story between a villain and a James Bond-esque spy. The visual was met with acclaim from commentators, who applauded its theme and choreography. It received two UK Music Video Awards and a Webby Award nomination. Miike Snow has performed live renditions of \"Genghis Khan\" on several occasions, including Jimmy Kimmel Live! and the radio program Morning Becomes Eclectic. In 2016, American duo MS MR performed a live cover of the song for Triple J's Like a Version.\n\"Genghis Khan\" was written by Miike Snow's three members, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt, in collaboration with Henrik Jonback, for the band's third studio album, iii (2016). While in the studio in Los Angeles, California, Karlsson had conceptualized the general melody and beats for a track when vocalist Wyatt began singing about Genghis Khan, a 13th century Mongolian emperor. Karlsson said, \"I was like get a microphone and sing it and he did and we kept it ... So 'Genghis Khan' came from his brain, it was something that went down really quickly and that's what came out.\" Karlsson told The Wall Street Journal that the song started coming together after about 30 minutes. After recording the verses and chorus, Wyatt added a \"whoo-oo-oo\" hook, inspired by a child he overheard singing along to Akon's vocals on Gwen Stefani's song \"The Sweet Escape\".\nThe chorus came about when Wyatt thought of himself and how he felt while in an undefined long-distance relationship with a woman he was not committing to, yet at the same time he did not want her seeing anyone else. In an interview for Notion, he explained he felt like a \"tyrant\" and thought the notion of feeling the need to \"have every girl\" is \"a little bit Genghis Khan\", perceiving it as a \"natural metaphor\" for him. He further elaborated on the topic of tyranny in a separate interview for Nylon, \"I felt that the nature of tyranny comes from that place, where you're entitled to freedom and choice and the other person has to be subjected to your scheme of things.\" He clarified that he is not endorsing Genghis Khan, but rather \"identifying a negative property within [him]self\" when referencing the emperor.\n\"Genghis Khan\" is one of two tracks on iii that were co-produced by the band and Jonback, along with \"Back of the Car\". While working on their previous studio album Happy to You (2012), the band focused on a uniform sound as Wyatt wanted to present a consistent character during concerts. This changed for iii as the singer put his focus on his studio efforts rather than his stage performance. He adapted his singing style based on the needs of each song throughout the album, using a \"sneering tone\" on \"Genghis Khan\". The track was mixed by the band and Niklas Flyckt. Flyckt utilized a Urei 1176LN limiting amplifier to emphasize the ghost notes, and a Thermionic Culture Vulture to enhance the sound"

The song was written by Ina Wroldsen and Steve Mac, who also produced the song. The single was released digitally on 22 May 2011. \"Notorious\" was recorded in 2011 after the band were looking for a new sound to release in their third album. According to the lyrics in the song the band are loving life, they like to go out and enjoy themselves however they work hard and they all have a bad and naughty side to them. The lyrics of the song has been described as \"playful\". Vanessa White said the song was a more \"grown up\" approach to the music they have released before. The group performed the song live for the first time on So You Think You Can Dance and the song received its first radio airplay on The Chris Moyles Show.\n\"Notorious\" received mainly positive reviews from critics. It gained comparisons to the Black Eyed Peas, Rihanna and Kelis. Some critics labelled the song as \"quite amazing\" and \"big\" and \"a bit Black Eyed Peas-esque\". It song was also praised for the big production of the song. Aled Jones described the song as \"unexpected\" from the group. It has also been said that the all-girl group are bringing a tougher, edgier sound. Yahoo! Music questioned the song if it was enough, stating; \"a bad girl\", short skirts, nice hair, rave breakdown - but is it enough?\".\nThe single's release was accompanied by a music video, which was filmed in Los Angeles; and the final version of the video premiered on both the band's official website and ITV2 at 8:30am on 19 May 2011. The music video has been described as \"sexy secretary look as they knuckle down to a day's work at the office\" and \"The lift handily opens out into a dance floor where they strut their stuff in front of some appreciative men.\"  However; the music video has been compared to Boots pharmacy advert but \"with a better song\". In the music video, the band had number of different clothing changing where they went for the secretary look and then later changed into stylish clothes for the clubbing scene. They also released 20 second teasers of the video until the full video was broadcast. Also, before the release of the song, each member released \"lyric teasers\" where they would release lyrics of the song each day.\n\"Notorious\" is a dance-pop and R&B song. In late 2010; after the release of their previous single, \"Higher\" the band originally announced that they would be heading back into the recording studio in 2011 in order to record their third studio album. In March 2011, the song's producer Steve Mac confirmed that he had finished the single and it was almost ready for release. He revealed that the single was \"different\" from their past hit singles, despite being written and produced by the same song-writers. \"Notorious\" was released as the lead single from their third studio album, after they announced Headlines! would only be an extended play and according to their record label, the CD would \"act as a bridge\" between last studio album Wordshaker (2009) and their upcoming third full one in 2011.\nMollie King stated that the song is about when you step on the dance floor you turn into a completely different person, which you turn into a bad girl. Una spoke; \"Dance music is massive at the moment so it's a dance track, but it also has something unique behind it. It's got this drop-out chorus where it's just the beat and you can only hear our voices - there aren't many tracks like that, so it's a bit different.\" The band were asked by Wonderland what they were 'Notorious' for and they replied with \"We are notorious for making good music, hopefully.\" Where Una said she wanted to make live shows notorious.\nThe band began to tease fans with details for the single. The first teasers were released week beginning 2 May 2011, where the girls released \"lyric teasers\" each day the band would release an image of one of the members holding a piece of paper with some lyrics on. The following week, behind the scenes images of the music video were released. The band officially announced their single on their official website stating the song would be released on 22 May 2011. Vanessa White told Heat World that \"Notorious\" was more grown up to what the band had already released which their whole album would be more \"grown up\". She also"

The song was the result of combining two pieces of music, the first of which was conceived in the studio, and the second of which was a soundcheck recording from one of the group's concert tours that was discovered by guitarist the Edge. The lyrics were written by lead vocalist Bono and describe two characters in a brightly lit city in a futuristic version of European society. Some lyrics in the song were taken directly from advertising slogans, and they also featured the phrase \"dream out loud\", which has appeared in other U2 media. The song touched on several themes, including moral confusion and the future of European society.\nPromotional recordings of the song were released in the United States and Mexico, and the song appeared on two record charts shortly after its release in 1993. The song was briefly performed at three shows on U2's Zoo TV Tour in 1993. The band had difficulties performing it in 1993, and it was not played again until the U2 360\u00b0 Tour in 2011.\nThe recording of the song received mostly positive reception from critics, who praised it as the album's opening track.\nDuring the Zoo TV Tour in 1992, U2 were trying to create a vision of an attractive future for Europe, as opposed to a negative, dystopian image that would be found in science fiction. With recent and ongoing events in Europe, such as the Revolutions of 1989, the enlargement of the European Union, and the Bosnian War, lead vocalist Bono created a surreal vision of a European location called \"Zooropa\".  Bono has referred to Zooropa as being a concept album, with a main theme of the exploration of interpellation within the European Union.\nBono and guitarist the Edge had been reading works by cyberpunk author William Gibson, who wrote about a futuristic urban environment known as \"The Sprawl\".  Gibson was an influence in the texture of the song, which Bono described as \"fucked up sci-fi\". Bono wanted to use noise to create a visual setting for the song, similar to Gibson's futuristic world, filled with advertisements on LED displays and neon signs, as in the 1982 film Blade Runner.  With \"Zooropa\" as the album's opening song, Bono stated that he wanted the album's music to be like \"legal drugs\" that would create a trip where \"you come out of the other end and you feel like you've been on some kind of a journey\". The closing song on the album, \"The Wanderer\", features Johnny Cash on vocals, and was intended on being the \"antidote\" to the futuristic-sounding opener.\n\"Zooropa\" was written and recorded during the album's sessions at Windmill Lane Studios and The Factory Studios in Dublin, which took place from March to May 1993 between legs of the Zoo TV Tour. The song was created from two separate pieces of music. The first was a jam session recorded by the band in Dublin during the album's sessions. The second was a soundcheck the band had recorded a few years prior on tour in Australia or New Zealand that the Edge found while listening to cassette recordings of their soundchecks. Along with sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy, the Edge edited the best parts of the soundcheck using Sound Tools to create a song arrangement, which served as a backing track. The two-halves of the song were then edited into a stereo mix. Producer Flood created an atmospheric mix and then crossfaded it in with the song's \"sombre, ethereal\" introduction. The bass guitar in the intro was played by drummer Larry Mullen Jr. while the Edge was busy working on the album's guitar riffs.\nSynthesizer sounds were added by producer Brian Eno on a Yamaha DX7 keyboard, including a \"squishy, mad-synth sound\" to create a \"dovetail\" connecting the different segments of the song. The Edge later added guitar tracks, as well as additional sounds to the song using an EMS Synthi\u00a0A synthesiser. Once the song was almost finished, the band had doubts about the first half's backing track. Having established an arrangement for the song, they performed it again in the studio and used the new recording for the first half, while using portions of the new performance for the second half.\nThe band had originally intended on recording an EP during the sessions, but"

It is the eleventh track on their 1997 album, Pop, and was released as its fourth single on 20 October 1997.\nAs with \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", the song is about The Troubles in Northern Ireland. The single cover for this song features pictures of four Northern Irish politicians \u2013 Gerry Adams, David Trimble, Ian Paisley, and John Hume (clockwise from top left).\nTwo months before the release of the single, live versions of \"Please\" and three other songs from the PopMart Tour were released on the Please: PopHeart Live EP in September 1997.\nThis song was played live during every performance of the PopMart Tour, with an outro similar to the drumbeat to that of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday.\"  Each performance segued directly into \"Where the Streets Have No Name.\"  During the Elevation Tour, the song was initially played in electric form before being played acoustically by Bono and the Edge at about 20 different shows.  The song has not been played in full since the final show of the Elevation Tour. However, it was frequently sampled along with \"The Hands That Built America\" during \"Bullet the Blue Sky\" on the Vertigo Tour. It was later sampled in the outro of \"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\" on the U2 360\u00b0 Tour to lead into the beginning of fellow Northern Ireland Troubles song \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\".\nNote\nThe four live tracks were previously released in other countries on the Please: Popheart Live EP.\nThe \"Please\" singles were backed with the following B-sides:\nTwo remixes of \"Dirty Day\" from Zooropa were made for the single, both by Butch Vig and Duke Erikson of the alternative rock group Garbage.\nThis song was recorded for the soundtrack for Wim Wenders' The End of Violence, in collaboration with Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor. The version featured here is an instrumental remix, with few differences from the original version.\nThis performance was taken from the European premi\u00e8re of the PopMart Tour on 18 July 1997 at Feijenoord Stadium, in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The middle eight in \"Please\" featured the drumbeat from \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", and the outro, with Bono's falsetto, segued into the opening chords of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", which was updated to an almost techno sound. The end of the performance included some lyrics from another song from Pop, \"The Playboy Mansion\".\nThis performance of \"With or Without You\" was taken from the first leg of the PopMart Tour in June 1997, at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, Canada.\nThis performance of \"Staring at the Sun\", played by Bono and the Edge as part of an acoustic set at the PopMart concerts, was a departure from the version on the Pop album. It was a more subtle, vocal-oriented version, with only the two guitars and some harmonies during the choruses.\nThere are five versions of this song available:\nThe album version, featured on Pop.\nThe single version, on the single and video. This version was more similar to the live performances, with an orchestrated intro and the \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" drumbeat on the middle eight. This version was recorded at the Wisseloord Studios in Hilversum, Netherlands.\nThe USA edit, a special edit included on the US versions of the \"Please\" single CD. It is a more stripped down and shortened version of the single version. Its running time is 3 minutes, 55 seconds.\nThe live performance from the 18 July 1997 concert in Rotterdam, also from the single.\nAnother live performance, from the 3 December 1997 concert in Mexico City. This version appears on the Hasta la Vista Baby! album.\nThe \"Please\" music video is a black-and-white concept piece by Anton Corbijn. It takes place on a street called \"No Name\" (a reference to the song \"Where the Streets Have No Name\") where a beggar is standing, with a sign saying \"please\" hanging from his neck. Several people pass by on their knees, until a point where this situation is reversed. The band actually does not show up for much of the video, finally making an appearance during the Edge's guitar solo.  This video appears on the DVD for The Best of 1990-2000, along with the director's commentary.\nTwo live videos from the PopMart Tour have been released as well \u2013 one video from the PopMart: Live from Mexico City release, and one known as the \"Mural Mix\", (filmed in Helsinki on 9 August 1997), which was released on \"The History Mix\" bonus disc from The Best of 1990-2000 & B-Sides.\n\n\n\nAll times \"Please\" has been played live\n\"Australian-charts.com \u2013 U2 \u2013 Please\".

It was released through RCA UK on 4 November 2020, as the third promotional single from their sixth studio album of the same name. The song was written by MNEK, Kamille, Maegan Cottone and TMS, and was produced by the latter. \"Confetti\" is a pop song which is reminiscent of a compilation of early 2000s hits. It sees the group celebrating independence after a break-up and focuses on their individual enjoyment of life.\nA remix of \"Confetti\" featuring American rapper Saweetie was later released on 30 April 2021, as the fourth and final single from the album. It marked Little Mix's first song released as a trio, following Jesy Nelson's departure from the group in December 2020, although her vocals are featured in the original album version. A music video for the remix was released the same day as the song's release, and was included as a bonus track on the Record Store Day vinyl editions of the album, released on 12 June.\n\"Confetti\" received generally positive reviews upon its initial and final release from music critics, with many praising its feel-good vibe and self-sufficient lyrics. The remix was described as an \"explosive return\" as this was their first release of 2021 and as a trio. Commercially, the album version peaked within the top 40 of the UK Official Singles Chart at number 23, while the remix peaked at number 9. The song was later certified gold in the country by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\nThe solo version of the song was released on 4 November 2020, two days before the parent album dropped on 6 November 2020. The remix version of \"Confetti\" features American rapper Saweetie. Little Mix announced the remix on 22 April 2021 through their social media by posting an accompanying video announcement. The remix was released on 30 April 2021 and served as the fourth and final single from their sixth studio album of the same name. The remix version of the song does not include former member Jesy Nelson's vocals, as this marked the group's first release after her departure from the group in 2020, although her verse was included in the album version. The remix was also inlcuded as a bonus track on the Record Store Day vinyl editions of the album, which was released on 12 June 2021.\nIn an interview with Euphoria Magazine, member Perrie Edwards shared her thoughts about the song saying, \"We love the song \u2018Confetti,\u2019 it\u2019s always been one of our favorites and we know from socials that the fans love it too!\". \"It felt right to do an updated version of the song and give it a moment!\" Jade Thirlwall added. Talking about the music video Leigh-Anne Pinnock said, \"We really feel it might be one of our best videos ever. We\u2019re really excited for everyone to see it\". After the departure of Nelson from the group in 2020 and making this song as their first release since then, Thirlwall stated \"It\u2019s just learning to adapt. I think it\u2019s quite exciting. And we got off to a good start as a three by having our No. 1 single in the UK. That was like, \u2018Oh wow, this is a good sign, good omen, that this year is going to be good for us.\" To promote the song, the group also appeared on the cover of Euphoria Magazine, a day before the song was released. Little Mix released a \"Confetti\" themed filter on Instagram as well to further promote the single.\n\"Confetti\" is a pop song written by Tom Barnes, Pete Kelleher, Ben Kohn, Camille Purcell, Uzoechi Emenike, Maegan Cottone, with Saweetie writing her verse on the remix version. The song was produced solely by TMS. It runs for a total length of three minutes and five seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, the song is written in the key of A minor.\nLyrically, the song contains self-sufficient lyrics and talks about being strong and celebrating independence after a break-up. The song also promotes a focus on one\u2019s individual enjoyment of life, a lack of preoccupation with men and relationships, and an appreciation for what one has right here and now. Musically, the song is reminiscent of a compilation of early 2000s hits, and encapsulates the feel-good tone of the album as a whole.\nIn an interview with Nylon, Pinnock stated that the song is also about \"female empowerment\". She added \"I think that's what we do best. So we absolutely love having females on our tracks\". Pinnock went on to describe Saweetie's feature on the remix as \"perfect\""

The song was written by Lipa, Clarence Coffee Jr. and its producer Jeff Bhasker. Intended to be \"playful and fun,\" it is a synth-pop song that contains elements of disco, funk, hip pop, house and 1980s music. The lyrics discuss themes of feminism and self-reflection with Lipa referring to herself as a \"female alpha\".\n\"Future Nostalgia\" was released for digital download and streaming on 13 December 2019 through Warner Records as the first and only promotional single from the album. Several music critics complimented the throwback yet futuristic sound and experimental nature of the song. Some also found Lipa's confident attitude and the song's sassy lyrics appealing. The song placed on year-end lists published by the Official Charts Company, Popjustice and Vulture. It entered official charts in Australia, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia and Spain, while also charting on component charts in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\nA lyric video was released for \"Future Nostalgia\" on 16 December 2019. A remix of the song by Joe Goddard appears on Lipa and The Blessed Madonna's remix album, Club Future Nostalgia (2020). Lipa promoted the song with a performance at her Studio 2054 livestream concert.\n\"Future Nostalgia\" was written by Dua Lipa, alongside Clarence Coffee Jr. and the song's producer Jeff Bhasker. They worked on the song in Los Angeles. Before writing it, Lipa and Bhasker had been experimenting in the studio for a few days to get a feel of how they wanted to work together and for Lipa to play Bhasker some of the music she had been working on. The two had not collaborated previously, although Lipa was a fan of Bhasker due to his previous work with other artists. While leaving the studio one day, Lipa accidentally texted Bhasker complimenting him and writing that she wanted to do some sessions together, thinking she was texting her manager. When they went back into the studio together, Lipa and Bhasker began talking about architecture and being overly confident, as well as having a laugh over their text conversation.\nAfter discussing writing a song together, Lipa told Bhasker the name of her album, Future Nostalgia. Bhasker then suggested them attempting to write a title track. Lipa wanted to create something bold, so Bhasker began playing his instruments with very experimental sounds and she began writing down lyrics. After they had written half of \"Future Nostalgia\", the two of them got writer's block, which lead to Lipa calling Clarence Coffee Jr to help them. They wanted it to be \"playful and fun\" and not taking themselves too seriously. That day the three of them came up with the line \"I know you ain't used to a female alpha.\" Lipa explained that she did not necessarily consider herself to be a \"female alpha\" but thought that if she put it in to writing, she could almost manifest that energy. \"Future Nostalgia\" was the first song written for Future Nostalgia.\nMusically, \"Future Nostalgia\" is a synth-pop song with disco, funk, hip pop, house and 1980s elements. It is composed in  time in the key of A minor, with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. The track has a structure of verse, chorus, bridge, verse, chorus, post-chorus, middle eight, chorus. The verses use solely the D5 chord, while the track follows a Dm\u2013C\u2013G/B\u2013C/G chord progression everywhere else. \"Future Nostalgia\" has a modern electronic production, consisting of 1980s-funk and grunge bass-popping, electroclash synths, tinkering keys, a jazz piano progression, 1980s disco beats and brass instrumentation.\nThe song opens with vintage synth plinks and drum machines, while the middle eight features rhythm guitar. Lipa's vocals span from C\u2084 to D\u2085, and she makes use of cocky spoken word and talk-rapped verses as well as purring falsetto in the chorus. The track features vocodered backing vocals, courtesy of Bhasker, where he repeats the title of the song. In the song, Lipa name-drops American architect John Lautner as well as Bhasker. The Lautner name drop is a symbol for Lipa's desire to make her music sound futuristic and retro at the same time. Described by Lipa as a \"feeling of empowerment and sassiness,\" the song's lyrics deal with the themes of feminism"

It was written by Mabel, 24kGoldn, Kamille, Grace Chatto and Jack Patterson, the latter two of whom also produced the song with Mark Ralph. It was released by Atlantic Records UK on 21 August 2020 as the first single from Clean Bandit's upcoming third studio album. The song is also included as a bonus track on digital and streaming versions of Mabel's debut studio album, High Expectations.\nClean Bandit started writing \"Tick Tock\" in November 2019 and finished it just before the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic the following year. The group never met 24kGoldn who features on the track in person, as he was in Los Angeles at the time. The song is about an obsessive relationship.\nOn 17 August 2020, Grace Chatto of Clean Bandit announced the song through a video posted on the group's social media pages. \"Our new single is ready, it's called 'Tick Tock' and features Mabel and 24kGoldn, it's out this Friday,\" she said. \"We are so excited for you to hear it!\" The single's cover art was also revealed in the Instagram post. Mabel and 24kGoldn replied to the post with a smiling face with hearts emoji and \"let's goooo\", respectively. Mabel also posted a short video of her lip-syncing to the song on her social media pages.\nAn acoustic version of the song and an acoustic video was released on 4 September 2020.\nDirected solely by Clean Bandit, the official video for \"Tick Tock\" premiered at 1 pm BST on 21 August 2020, after a 30-second trailer was released one day prior. It takes place at a house that resembles a cuckoo clock in the middle of a forest of glaciers. It also features a bathtub full of popcorn, as well as cardboard cities with running trains surrounding various music instruments, such as drums and digital pianos.\nWhile the song is about obsessive relationships, the music video takes a slightly different direction. Jack Patterson said that they took a lighter approach and made the video about their own individual obsessions. \"I have a Hornby model of a Eurostar train spinning around me. I love all types of transport,\" said Patterson.\nOn 29 August 2020, Clean Bandit and Mabel performed the song live during the final of the fourth series of The Voice Kids UK.\nDigital download and streaming\n\"Tick Tock\" (featuring 24kGoldn) \u2013 2:58\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 Acoustic\n\"Tick Tock\" (Acoustic) \u2013 3:08\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 Joel Corry Remix\n\"Tick Tock\" (featuring 24kGoldn) (Joel Corry Remix) \u2013 2:39\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 Sam Feldt Remix\n\"Tick Tock\" (featuring 24kGoldn) (Sam Feldt Remix) \u2013 2:34\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 UK Mix\n\"Tick Tock\" (featuring S1mba) (UK Mix) \u2013 2:58\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 VIP Remix\n\"Tick Tock\" (featuring Beenie Man and Konshens) (VIP Remix) \u2013 3:00\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 Topic remix\n\"Tick Tock\" (featuring 24kGoldn) (Topic remix) \u2013 2:32\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nOriginal version\nGrace Chatto \u2013 production\nJack Patterson \u2013 production\nMark Ralph \u2013 production\nMabel \u2013 vocals\nAcoustic version\nAshton Miranda \u2013 production\nBenjamin Totten \u2013 production\nThomas Totten \u2013 production\nMabel \u2013 vocals\n\n\n\n\n\nBain, Katie (24 August 2020). \"First Spin: The Week's Best New Dance Tracks From Duke Dumont, Clean Bandit, Whipped Cream & More\".

After the departure of Nelson from the group in 2020 and making this song as their first release since then, Thirlwall stated \"It\u2019s just learning to adapt. I think it\u2019s quite exciting. And we got off to a good start as a three by having our No. 1 single in the UK.

It first appeared in its original version on Moloko's second album, I Am Not a Doctor; it was released as a single on 8 March 1999, reaching number 45 on the UK Singles Chart. The song experienced chart success after it was remixed by DJ Boris Dlugosch, peaking at number four in the UK in September 1999. Murphy had started writing the lyrics while clubbing in New York City, and knew the song was at heart a dance track, but the group wanted to record it in a different artistic fashion for its album version.\nTogether with their record company they had commissioned mixes by Todd Terry (who had turned Everything But the Girl's \"Missing\" into an international club anthem). Moloko were not satisfied with the Terry mix and had to convince their label Echo Records to put out the Boris D. version instead. The remixed version was eventually featured on over 100 compilations, and was later added on Moloko's third album, Things to Make and Do, after hitting the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. In 1999 it reached number one on the US dance chart. As a form of barter for the remix, Moloko vocalist R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy later co-wrote and appeared on Boris D.'s \"Never Enough\" single, starring in the video for that release as well.\nScottish newspaper Aberdeen Press and Journal viewed \"Sing It Back\" as a \"Balearic hit\". In her review of the I Am Not a Doctor album, Heather Phares from AllMusic described it as a \"techno torch song\". A reviewer from Daily Record said it is \"their best single since 1996's Fun For Me\". Stevie Chick from NME wrote, \"Roisin Murphy, it must be said, has a remarkable voice, a chalky, skewed howl which can twist into a purr, a cry or a sexy growl. On 'Sing It Back', she's cast as Eartha Kitt, all unquenchable lust, sly, coquettish snarls, a luxuriant, lingering sigh. What a shame it's wasted on some of the limpest, radio-friendly handbag tedium ever put on wax.\"\nThe music video was produced to promote the single, directed by Dawn Shadforth. It features Moloko vocalist R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy dancing alone in a metallic flapper dress, accompanied by psychedelic lighting effects. The video is featured on the DVD of Moloko's special edition for the Statues album. It was later published on Moloko's official YouTube channel in October 2016. The video has amassed more than 16,4 million views as of September 2021. \nSeveral live videos exist as well, including one in the group's live concert movie 11,000 Clicks, a similar concert version from the Dutch Pinkpop broadcast, a televised version from the TV show Later... with Jools Holland, and a samba version featured on MTV Brasil.\nQ Magazine ranked \"Sing It Back\" at number 905 in their list of the 1001 Best Songs Ever in 2002.\nAustralian music channel Max placed it at number 887 in their list of 1000 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2012.\nGerman magazine Musikexpress listed the song as number 449 in their ranking of the 700 Best Songs of All-Time in 2014.\nMixmag put the song in their list of Vocal House: The 30 All-Time Biggest Anthems in 2018.\nTomorrowland featured the song in their Official The Ibiza 500 as high as number 55.\nUK CD1\n\"Sing It Back\" (Tee's Radio) \u2013 3:25\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T Loco Mix) \u2013 5:22\n\"Sing It Back\" (DJ Plankton's Dub) \u2013 8:32\nUK CD2\n\"Sing It Back (Boris Musical Mix Edit) \u2013 4:38\n\"Sing It Back (Herbert's Tasteful Dub) \u2013 5:38\n\"Sing It Back (Tee's Freeze Mix) \u2013 9:02\nBoris Dlugosch mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Musical Mix) \u2013 9:15\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Musical Mix Edit) \u2013 4:37\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Main Instrumental) \u2013 9:19\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Funk Dub) \u2013 6:53\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Reprise) \u2013 8:14\n\"Sing It Back\" (BMR Club Mix) \u2013 7:12\nLevent Canseven mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Levent's Funk-O-Rama Mix) \u2013 7:40\n\"Sing It Back\" (Levent's Funk-O-Rama Dub) \u2013 7:42\n\"Sing It Back\" (Can 7 Supermarket Mix) \u2013 8:20\n\"Sing It Back\" (Can 7 Supermarket Radio) \u2013 4:04\nMousse T. mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Bootleg Dub) \u2013 7:37\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Feel Love Mix) \u2013 7:09\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Feelluvdub) \u2013 7:09\nMatthew Herbert mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Herbert's Evangelista Albertini Acid House Mix) \u2013 6:44\n\"Sing It Back\" (Herbert's Tasteful Dub) \u2013 5:58\nTodd Terry mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mike Penfold paranoia ice Mix) \u2013 9:02\n\"Sing It Back\" (Tee's Radio) \u2013 3:26\nBooker T mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T Loco Mix) \u2013 5:23\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T"

The song was inspired by 1980s music and is lyrically about moving on after a heartbreak. It was released on 27 March 2020 through RCA UK as the lead single off their sixth studio album, Confetti (2020). \"Break Up Song\" peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart and charted in several other countries. It has since received gold music certifications from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and from Pro-M\u00fasica Brasil (PMB).\nLittle Mix members Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall wrote \"Break Up Song\" with Frank Nobel, and producers Kamille and Goldfingers. According to Thirlwall, they wrote the song more than a year prior to its release with 1980s pop music and an element of nostalgia in mind, similar to that of their 2015 single \"Black Magic\". Edwards, Pinnock and Thirlwall composed it during a whirl of creativity where they wrote seven songs with Kamille in one day, after having only one melody from a frustrating previous session. The track's 1980s sound stemmed from a synthesiser they dabbled with in the studio.\nA different song was initially chosen as their sixth album's lead single with an accompanying music video already filmed. However, the group opted for \"Break Up Song\" at the last minute after hearing the demo again during a playback session. The demo had only one verse and main line. Edwards described it as \"very basic at the time. The beat was all over the place and it was really, really rough - but it just had something about it.\" Thirlwall recalled, \"We got that jittery feeling that we had with \"Shout Out to My Ex\" and \"Black Magic\" where it just felt special.\"\nThirlwall described the track as \"a very feel-good kind of empowerment song about going out and just forgetting about all your woes and troubles\". It was also called an \"80s-synth pop anthem\" about \"getting over the end of a relationship\".\nA Little Mix-themed filter on Instagram was made available to the group's followers to promote the track. The song was released on 27 March 2020 and on the same day a Spotify vertical video and a lyric video were both released. The latter was made by Kayleigh, a fan of the band from the Netherlands.\nLittle Mix announced the official music video for the song on 7 May 2020 on their social media, and it was released a day later at 9am BST. The music video for the song was semi-animated, as the planned video shoot for the song had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The group filmed portions of the video at home using the original concept. The animation of the video displayed felt fabric texture to depict the band. In the video, the animated part was focused on the group hosting a Good Morning Britain-style breakfast show on a television channel called LM TV. Leigh- Anne Pinnock is presented as a news reporter, while Jesy Nelson presents the weather forecast. Perrie Edwards is presented as a fitness mentor, while Jade Thirlwall tackles the latest fashion, with each of them having their own segment in their respective verses of the song. The video also includes real-life clips of the band dancing to the song while dressed in different styles of 80's clothing.\nOn 21 August 2020, Little Mix performed \"Break Up Song\" for the first time as part of the set list for their Little Mix Uncancelled concert. The song was later performed on the eighteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing in December 2020, with member Jesy Nelson absent from the performance.\nDigital download and streaming\n\"Break Up Song\" \u2013 3:20\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 acoustic\n\"Break Up Song\" (acoustic version) \u2013 3:22\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 Nathan Dawe remix\n\"Break Up Song\" (Nathan Dawe remix) \u2013 3:21\nDigital download and streaming \u2013 Steve Void remix\n\"Break Up Song\" (Steve Void remix) \u2013 2:57\nStreaming \u2013 Break Up Song \u2013 EP\n\"Break Up Song\" \u2013 3:20\n\"Break Up Song\" (acoustic version) \u2013 3:22\n\"Break Up Song\" (Nathan Dawe remix) \u2013 3:21\n\"Break Up Song\" (Steve Void remix) \u2013 2:57\nCredits adapted from Qobuz.\nJesy Nelson\u00a0\u2013 vocals\nLeigh-Anne Pinnock\u00a0\u2013 vocals, songwriting\nJade Thirlwall\u00a0\u2013 vocals, songwriting\nPerrie Edwards\u00a0\u2013 vocals, songwriting\nKamille\u00a0\u2013 production, keyboards, vocal production, bass, background vocals\nGoldfingers\u00a0\u2013 production, drums, keyboards, programming\nRaphaella Mazaheri-Asadi\u00a0\u2013 vocal production\nFrank Nobel\u00a0\u2013 drums, keyboards,"

It was released through Big Hit Music and Sony Music on July 9, 2021, as a stand-alone single. The song was also included as part of the CD release of the group's previous single \"Butter\", and is the band's third English-language single.\n\"Permission to Dance\" was written by Ed Sheeran, Johnny McDaid, Steve Mac and Jenna Andrews, with production being handled by Mac and Andrews alongside Stephen Kirk. Sheeran had previously co-written \"Make It Right\", from BTS's Map of the Soul: Persona (2019). Big Hit initially described that the song \"will make your heart beat to the rhythm of BTS's positive energy\". The song has been described as an upbeat dance-pop song.\nOn May 21, 2021, BTS released their second English-language single \"Butter\" to critical and commercial success. The song was initially released digitally, as a cassette, and as a 7-inch vinyl. On June 15, BTS announced a CD release of \"Butter\" alongside the announcement for a new song. On June 27, Ed Sheeran revealed in an interview with Most Requested Live that he wrote a song for BTS, stating \"I've actually worked with BTS on their last record, and I've just written a song for their new record\".

The song also became BTS' fifth number-one hit on the chart in ten months and two weeks, marking them as the artists with the fastest accumulation of five number-one singles since Michael Jackson in 1988. Additionally, the song became their fourth single to debut at the top spot on the Hot 100, extending their record as the group with the most number-one single debuts (tied with Justin Bieber and Drake, and behind Ariana Grande, who has five).

The song debuted atop the Billboard Hot Trending Songs, a chart powered by Twitter to look at which songs are discussed most on the platform.\nIn the music video, the band members are seen dancing in multiple settings including, a sunny locale, a laundromat, and a patio. The video garnered 72.3 million views on its first day, becoming the sixth-most viewed YouTube video in the first 24 hours at the time of its release.\nUnlike with past singles, BTS did not attend any music programs to promote the song, but still won eight first-place trophies, and achieved a triple crown on Inkigayo.\nCD single and digital EP\n\"Butter\" \u2013 2:44\n\"Permission to Dance\" \u2013 3:07\n\"Butter\" (instrumental) \u2013 2:42\n\"Permission to Dance\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:07\nDigital\n\"Permission to Dance\" \u2013 3:07\n\"Permission to Dance\" (R&B remix) \u2013 3:36\n\"Permission to Dance\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:07\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nBTS \u2013 primary vocals\nEd Sheeran \u2013 songwriting\nJohnny McDaid \u2013 songwriting\nSteve Mac \u2013 songwriting, production\nJenna Andrews \u2013 songwriting, production, vocal production\nStephen Kirk \u2013 production, vocal production\nChris Laws \u2013 audio engineer\nDan Pursey \u2013 audio engineer\nJuan Pena \u2013 audio engineer\nKeith Perry \u2013 audio engineer\nRob Grimaldi \u2013 audio engineer\nPdogg \u2013 audio engineer, vocal arrangement\nJohn Hanes \u2013 audio engineer\nSerban Ghenea \u2013 mixing engineer\nChris Gehringer \u2013 mastering engineer\n\n\n\n\n\nSkinner, Tom (July 1, 2021). \"BTS tease new Ed Sheeran collaboration 'Permission To Dance'\".

It was released digitally in the United States on April 7, 2009, to US radio on April 28, 2009, and in the UK on August 10, 2009. The song contains a sample of Steam's \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\". An uptempop dance pop track, the lyrics of the song deal with DeBarge getting over her ex-boyfriend. A music video was released to promote the song, which features DeBarge and her friends stealing her ex-boyfriend's car and driving to various locations, including a house party. Throughout the video, DeBarge is seen flirting with several men in an attempt to get back at her ex-boyfriend.\nDespite the mixed critical reception, it achieved some commercial success, peaking in the top forty in Sweden and the top twenty in Canada and the United States, but it fared better as a dance single, peaking at number three on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Despite the minimal chart performance of the single, it has become her biggest hit to date, as well as her only single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US.\n\"Goodbye\" was one of the first songs that was recorded for the album. During an interview with TheStarScoop, DeBarge said of the first time she heard the song on the radio,\n\"I was screaming up and down. I was actually at home and listening to New York Radio Online. I had called all my friends, telling them to listen. My mom video taped me. It was really surreal for me. Every time I hear my song on the radio, I just take it in and [it's] so cool. It\u2019s me!\"\n\n\"Goodbye\" is generally considered a pop-dance track. J!-ENT described the song as \"an upbeat, addictive track utilizing the classic 1969 Steam track \u201cNa Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\u201d. A wonderful debut single for Kristinia.\" People magazine praised the song and compared it to recent releases by Rihanna, stating \"First single 'Goodbye', an undeniable dance-pop confection, recalls Rihanna's 'S.O.S. (Rescue Me)', reworking Steam's 1969 hit 'Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye' much like 'S.O.S. (Rescue Me)' did 'Tainted Love'.\" Meanwhile, upon the song's UK release, noted R&B writer Pete Lewis of the 'Blues & Soul' referred to it as \"a punchy, upbeat single whose hook prominently samples the familiar hook from Steam's 1969 American Number One 'Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Godbye'\". Nick Levine of Digital Spy said, \"Like a low calorie chocolate bar, 'Goodbye' is sweet enough in the moment, but it doesn't have enough substance to leave you feeling really satisfied.\"\nGlenn Gamboa of Newsday said that \"DeBarge comes across as a streetwise Jordin Sparks on the \"stomping smash\". People called the song \"an undeniable dance-pop confection\". Time said that the song is \"so enjoyably trashy, it's a wonder no one thought of it before.\"\n\"Goodbye\" received generally mixed reviews from critics. Commonsensemedia praised the song, stating \"It's quite a feat to breathe new life into a song that has taken on such a life of its own. But DeBarge is able to make this song uniquely her own and put a funky dance twist on a classic. This young singer appears to have inherited the family talent for mass-appeal music with an easygoing style.\" DigitalSpy said of the single, \"Honestly, you wait years for someone to sample the hook from 'Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye', and then everyone does it at once! It backs Wale and Lady GaGa on 'Chillin', Jay-Z uses it to shoo off pop's most controversial vocal effect on 'D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)', and here's US newbie Kristinia DeBarge swallowing it whole on her debut single. Blame it on the over-familiarity of the sample, or maybe the fact that DeBarge nicks a trick from Rihanna's 'SOS (Rescue Me)' here, but the result isn't quite the pop smash it could be. The crux of the issue? Like a low calorie chocolate bar, 'Goodbye' is sweet enough in the moment, but it doesn't have enough substance to leave you feeling really satisfied.\"\nHeavenlyReviews praised the song as well, stating \"\"Goodbye\", this song is one of those strong anthem breakup songs that the rhythm just kinds gets stuck in your head and for the next seven days you will be singing this song, humming this song, and thinking about this song.\" Bisaidso were very critical of DeBarge, commenting \"Damn, we can\u2019t go five years without a new DeBarge trying to break into the music biz, can we? Her debut album (written and produced by Babyface) should out this summer. Let\u2019s hope young Kristinia doesn\u2019t end up with a rap sheet like"

It was written by Furtado, Tim \"Timbaland\" Mosley and Nate Hills. It was produced by Timbaland and Nate \"Danja\" Hills. The song features a prominent influence of 1980s dance music and sexually suggestive lyrics, in which the song's protagonist asks a lover to satisfy her sexually.\n\"Do It\" reached the top twenty in Canada and was a number-one dance hit in the United States, where it became Furtado's lowest peaking single on the Billboard Hot 100.\nThe music video for \"Do It\" was directed by Aaron A. (the documentarian on Furtado's Get Loose Tour), and co-directed by Furtado. The filming had taken place on location in Detroit. The video was premiered on MuchMusic on July 13, 2007, and on MTV's Total Request Live on August 1, 2007.\nIn January 2007, it was revealed that Timbaland plagiarized the synth line in \"Do It\" from an earlier track by Finnish demoscener Janne Suni and Glenn Rune Gallefoss.\nFurtado has credited the influence of 1980s musicians such as Blondie, Madonna, the Police, Prince and Talking Heads on Loose, saying that the album's creative team \"were picking up on some of the more surreal, theatrical elements of '80s music, the stuff that puts you in sort of a dream state. There's a mysterious, after-midnight vibe to this album that's extremely visceral. I want people to escape into the music and indulge their most animalistic impulses.\" Referring to the sexually suggestive lyrics in \"Do It\" and other songs on Loose, Furtado cited the influence of what she described as \"the assertive female sexuality of '90s hip-hop, from Queen Latifah to MC Lyte, Yo-Yo, Salt-N-Pepa, TLC. They were sexy, smart and creative\u2014strong women in control. That's what I like about the sexual content on Loose: It's very organic.\"\nBillboard magazine said \"[it] again demonstrates Furtado's striking versatility [...] Missy Elliott is stripped onto the single version, with a midsection breakdown . . . amusing, but hardly necessary in scoring yet another essential moment from [Loose]\". Stylus magazine cited the track and \"No Hay Igual\" as the album's \"undisputed highlights [...] The two songs couldn't possibly be more different, yet the duo [Furtado and Timbaland] manages to convincingly pull off both of them.\" Slant Magazine said the song is \"a deliciously uptempo 80's cut\", and The Guardian wrote that Furtado \"delivers irresistible hooks of Maneater, Promiscuous and Do It with punchy, playful charisma rather than breathy cooing.\" Blogcritics published a more negative assessment of the song:\nThe songs are much more upbeat and not recognizable as the Nelly Furtado that has come to make our ears flutter with her beautiful eclectic sounds. Take for example the song \"Do It\". What a blast from the '80s past! Here we have a song that would be a huge hit in the '80s thrown in on an album that so desperately wants to score a club hit so that teenagers will download the song as a ringtone. It's a mess. Should we blame Timbaland for the need to clean up aisle 3?\nThe Village Voice wrote that the song \"weakly evokes J.J. Fad\" and exemplified why Loose \"isn't a love child [between Furtado and Timbaland], but a bump-and-grind that never finds a groove\". The Northern Light editorialised, \"Although \"Do It\" fits well after \"Say It Right\" [the preceding track on the album], there is something very D+ about the song. As cute as it is, it sounds like something that was just better than a filler track.\" MTV News summarised \"Do It\" as a \"roller-skating jam [that] is all percolating, bubblegum keyboards\", and said it contained \"one of Timbaland's best beats since he put the snakey whistle on Ludacris' \"The Potion\"\". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote of the album and song, \"Ms. Furtado and Timbaland love unexpected details, and this secretly meticulous CD is full of them [...] in \"Do It\", Ms. Furtado mutters a casual \"Yeah\"; Timbaland samples it and turns it into a rhythm instrument that returns at the end of the song, to reward everyone who's paying attention.\" Billboard magazine wrote that the song contains \"breezy uptempo rhythmic instrumentation alongside a sensual lyric that requests a suitor to deliver the physical goods\", and that it is one of the tracks on Loose on which \"she extorts Gwen Stefani's '80s vibe and schoolgirl chants\". Hope, Clover. Other critics have identified a 1980s influence in the song. Stylus magazine described \"Do It\" as an \"undeniable '80s dance-pop\" song on"

The song, which features a rap verse from American rapper SchoolBoy Q, was written by Tinashe, Schoolboy Q, Bobby Brackins, DJ Mustard, Jon Redwine, and Marley Waters. It features a sample from the 2005 single \"We Be Burnin'\" by Jamaican recording artist Sean Paul, resulting in writing credits for Cezar Cunningham, Sean Paul, Steven Marsden, Delano Thomas, Michael Jarrett, and Craig Serani Marsh. \"2 On\" was released as Tinashe's commercial debut single from Aquarius on January 21, 2014 and was sent to US rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio on March 18, 2014.\n\"2 On\" is an electro-R&B song that contains elements of trap production. Lyrically, the song is a party song about living life to the fullest. Music critics mostly praised the song for its sound and carefree lyrics, and \"2 On\" was also noted by critics as a departure from Tinashe's murky alternative R&B that was part of her previous songs. The single peaked at number 24 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on US rhymthic radio, was the second-most played song of 2014 on the format, and was certified platinum by the RIAA. The song also reached the top forty in Australia and Flanders (Belgium).\nThe accompanying music video for the track was directed by Hannah Lux Davis and was released on March 24, 2014, with Tinashe dancing in several different scenes. To further promote the song, Tinashe made various live performances, including the SXSW Festival, the Power 106 LA concert, Capital Xtra, Rinse FM, V100.7/Milwaukee's Family Affair and  The Wendy Williams Show. Canadian rapper Drake released an unofficial rework of the song to his SoundCloud account; the song consisted of two parts, the new version of \"2 On\" and \"Thotful\". An official Spanish remix featuring reggaeton singer Randy was released on November 18, 2014, and later included on his mixtape Under Doxis.\n\"2 On\" was written by Tinashe, Schoolboy Q and Bobby Brackins and produced by DJ Mustard, Jon Redwine and DJ Marley Waters. It is nightclub-oriented, which contrasts with Tinashe's previous work such as her 2013 mixtape Black Water. She stated: \"I wanted '2 On' to be transitional, so people get used to the idea of, 'She can make songs that can play on the radio, and she can still make songs that I can vibe out to in my car.'\" \"2 On\" was released worldwide as a music download by RCA Records on January 21, 2014. It impacted US rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio on March 18, 2014.\n\"2 On\" is an electronic R&B song, marking a slight departure from the murky alternative R&B from her mixtapes. The song features \"effervescent keys\", \"synth-string accents\", finger snaps, trap hi-hats, electro beats and distant chilly sighs, the latter which Bradley Stern of MuuMuse described as more reminiscent of her mixtape releases. The song features a sample of Sean Paul's 2005 single \"We Be Burnin'\", with the line \"Just give me the trees and we can smoke it ya/Just give me the drink and we can pour it ya\" featured in the middle eight. As a result, the song's writers (Cezar Cunningham, Sean Paul Henriques, Steven Marsden, Delano Thomas, Michael Jarrett, and Craig Serani Marsh) are credited.\nLyrically, the song is a carpe-diem anthem about being \"super hyped up, super extra out on whatever emotion that it is.\" Although the song became her first hit and got a lot of people buzzing about the song, some listeners didn't really understand the concept of the meaning of \"2 On.\" She spoke with VladTV to address this by saying \"2 On is basically a new way of saying turn up. Being super hyped up with your friends when going out. I just wanted to come up with a fresh phrase that people can catch on to.\"\nJ. Leeds of the online publication Idolator praised the song's production calling it a \"club thumper\" and comparing the music video choreography to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson Tom Breihan of Stereogum commented on the throwback feel from the track saying \"2 On recreates some of the tropes of the late-\u201990s/early-\u201900s teenpop/R&B crossover era, but it does it within quotes\" and also comparing the video having an Aaliyah vibe on it.\nGotty, a writer for The Smoking Section, commented that \"made me want to rollerskate. Maybe not as rhythmic and polished as Tip and them did in ATL but I could definitely hit the rink, do a little bop once I get"

It was written by Tinashe, Bebe Rexha, Stargate, and Cashmere Cat, and produced by the latter two. A crunk&B song, \"All Hands on Deck\" contains a prominent pan flute breakdown, a thick bassline and \"club-friendly\" beat, and has been described as the \"sister song\" to the album's lead single \"2 On\" (2014). The track's lyrical content comprises a dance instructional and portrays a scenario of retaining confidence, and rebound dating after a break-up, and contain themes of girl power and self empowerment. On February 22, 2015, a remix version of the song premiered online featuring Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, and received a digital-only release on February 24. Serving as the third single from Aquarius, it impacted urban contemporary radio and was released as a digital download in the United States on February 24, 2015.\nThe song garnered positive reviews from music critics who commended its club appeal and Tinashe's vocals, while also naming it as a highlight on the album. Azalea's verse on the promotional remix version was also well-received, with critics opining that her addition was beneficial for the track's airplay prospects. Tinashe has performed \"All Hands on Deck\" for radio stations KPWR and Nova 106.9, and as part of her set list for her Aquarius Tour (2014\u201315).\n\"All Hands on Deck\" was written by Tinashe, Bebe Rexha, Stargate and Cashmere Cat, and produced by the latter two. Stargate and Cashmere Cat were also responsible for the track's instrumentation and programming, while the former recorded the song with Tinashe at DownTown Studios in New York City. \"All Hands on Deck\" was then mixed by Phil Tan at the Ninja Club in Atlanta, Georgia, and mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace, New York City. Other personnel involved included Tim Blacksmith and Danny D. as executive producers, and Daniela Rivera as an assistant engineer. The song's title was first revealed in the announcement of the Aquarius track listing on August 27, 2014. Tinashe then uploaded the original version of \"All Hands on Deck\" to her SoundCloud page along with the rest of the album on September 30, 2014. Rexha announced the song's single release on January 23, 2015, on Snapchat. On February 9, 2015, Tinashe announced that the single's release will be accompanied by a new version of the song which will contain a new verse from a guest feature. In an interview with WZMX, she stated, \"I wanted to put out something that's a little fresh, because the song has been on the album for a few months, so I wanted to give somebody a brand new verse, a little something-something\".\nOn February 21, 2015, Tinashe posted the single's cover art on her Instagram account. A remix version of \"All Hands on Deck\" was premiered by Perez Hilton on February 22, 2015, featuring Australian rapper Iggy Azalea rapping the song's new verse. The official remix was released as a promotional single for The Great Escape Tour, that both Azalea and Tinashe were scheduled to be a part of during the Spring 2015. It received its radio premiere on WZMX on February 23, 2015. Serving as the third single from Aquarius, it impacted urban contemporary radio and was released as a digital download in the United States on February 24, 2015. \"All Hands on Deck\" was commercially released in the United Kingdom on April 19, 2015. Another remix featuring DeJ Loaf was released on June 8, 2015.\n\"All Hands on Deck\" is a crunk&B song which contains elements of West Coast hip hop, grime and late 1990s-early 2000s R&B. It comprises a thick bassline, \"club-friendly\" beat, thudding synthesizers and a pan flute breakdown. Noted to be a shift from more sweet and coy-sounding tracks on Aquarius, Tinashe solicits a snarling technique in her vocal delivery, together with a more upbeat attitude and in contrast with Azalea's braggadocio. On the promotional remix single, Azalea's rapped verse occurs halfway through the song's duration, at its bridge, with the rapper announcing herself as \"Iggs\". Described as the \"sister song\" to Aquarius lead single \"2 On\", \"All Hands on Deck\" also garnered comparisons to Cassie's \"Long Way 2 Go\""

The song features compositional samples of songs derived from two Bollywood films of the 1970s, Apradh (1972) and Don (1978), as well as interpolations of Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam's 1985 single \"I Wonder If I Take You Home\" and Gucci Crew II's 1988 single \"Sally (That Girl)\". The song was released as the first single from Monkey Business; it was first serviced to mainstream radio on April 11, 2005, in the United States.\n\"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" is a hip hop song in which the lyrics, according to will.i.am, tells of a situation between a couple when one tries to end the relationship and the other is in disbelief.

It also attained top-10 positions in many European countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands.\n\"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" is one of two songs on Monkey Business that was written by will.i.am and Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas. Additional writers include George Pajon, Jr. and Printz Board.\nThe song contains samples of several songs: \"I Wonder If I Take You Home\", written and composed by Full Force, and \"Ae Naujawan Sab Kuchh Yahan\" and \"Yeh Mera Dil Pyaar Ka Diwana\", both recorded by Asha Bhosle, composed by Kalyanji Anandji, and with lyrics written by Indeewar. The former of the latter two was featured in the Hindi film Apradh (1972) while the latter was featured in the Hindi film Don (1978).\nBlack Eyed Peas member will.i.am, in addition to co-writing the song, produced the track on his own while working with Neil Tucker and Tal Herzberg on engineering it. Co-writer Pajon, Jr. contributed guitars while Keith Harris played the drums. \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" features a prominent use of several string instruments, which include the electric violin and Mellotron strings, played by Charlie Baccarat and song co-writer Board. It was then mixed by Mark \"Spike\" Stent and programmed by Herzberg using Pro Tools technology. The song was recorded at Metropolis Studios in Chiswick, London, England and The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California. \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" serves as the first single taken from Monkey Business (2005). Interscope Records solicited the song to mainstream radios on April 11, 2005 in the United States.\n\"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" is a hip-hop dance song that runs for 4 minutes and 4 seconds. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, it is written in a key of F minor. The song is set in common time and runs through a freely moving tempo of 132 beats per minute. will.i.am described the song to be the lyrical sequel to the band's 2003 single \"Shut Up\" (Elephunk, 2003). He explained: \"When you're on bad terms with a significant other, you don't want to break up. You tell her things and at the time you really mean them. But she's saying, stop f****ing  [sic] with me.\"  Jason King of The Village Voice called the song a \"sassy gender duel\" between will.i.am and Fergie, while commenting that it is reminiscent of \"Shut Up\".\nNicholas Taylor of PopMatters called \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" a \"standout\" in regard to \"complex and engaging hip-hop music, a mix of rap, soul, jazz, and funk that will constantly surprise and delight.\" However, he stated that \"Pump It\" would have been a better choice for the first single, writing that it \"continually impresses and grooves and better melds raps with beats\", while noting \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" to get repetitive and clunky. Taylor further explains the song's cons, writing that it suffers from \"unimpressive rapping\" and \"a distinct lack of substance\". John Bush of Allmusic"

Eriksen\nTor Erik Hermansen\nBeyonc\u00e9 Knowles. \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00e9 for her 2008 double album I Am... Sasha Fierce. Written by Beyonc\u00e9, Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, and production duo Stargate, it was initially a classic rhythm and blues song until Babyface changed the arrangement and chords. The track appears on the I Am... disc, the songs on which give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyonc\u00e9's life stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. It is a midtempo R&B ballad accompanied by piano, strings, and drum machine beats. The lyrics describe heartache and the insecurities of love.\nThe song was initially announced as the sixth single from I Am... Sasha Fierce in the United States and the fourth elsewhere, but was replaced with \"Sweet Dreams\". Columbia Records released \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" outside the US on August\u00a028, 2009. Critics praised Beyonc\u00e9's emotional vocals on the track but had divided opinions on the production. The single reached the top twenty on the singles charts of Australia, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Ireland. Sophie Muller directed a monochrome music video in which Beyonc\u00e9's character reminisces about her relationship on a beach in Malibu, California. Beyonc\u00e9 performed \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" on the I Am... World Tour (2009\u201310).\nBeyonc\u00e9 wrote \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" alongside the Norwegian production team Stargate, which consists of Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen. The duo initially composed \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" as a traditional rhythm and blues song but co-writer Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds changed one chord and added falsetto vocals. His recording a demo version preceded a rewrite of the backing track chords and the addition of a four-on-the-floor piano; the result was a \"grand-piano ballad\". According to the sheet music published by EMI, \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" was composed at a tempo of 84\u00a0beats per minute using common time in the key of D minor. Eriksen explained, \"I suppose many of our songs are in minor keys. We probably lean towards more a moody, melodic expression. It's what comes most natural for us.\"\nStargate and Beyonc\u00e9 produced \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" in 2008 at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City. Beyonc\u00e9 arranged & performed the vocals, which Jim Caruana recorded. Eriksen assisted in recording the instrumental track &, along with Hermansen, arranged the music & played the instruments. Mark \"Spike\" Stent and Matt Green then mixed the track. \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" is included on the double album I Am... Sasha Fierce as part of the I Am... disc, which features ballads that describe Beyonc\u00e9's insecurities about love and depict the person she is \"underneath all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama\". Beyonc\u00e9 said she likes to sing ballads because \"the music and the emotion in the story is told  [sic] so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. [On the I Am disc,] I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear what I had to say.\"\n\"Broken-Hearted Girl\" is a midtempo R&B ballad with an airy vocal melody. Beyonc\u00e9's vocals are accompanied by strings, a drum machine beat and a cascading melancholy piano that opens the song. The ballad has a Dm\u2013B\u266d\u2013F(add9)\u2013F\u2013C/E chord progression and a verse-chorus structure. Beyonc\u00e9 sings the introduction in a low vocal register that heightens her vocal power; in the song, her voice ranges from F\u2083 to F\u2085.\nAccording to Beyonc\u00e9, the lyrics of \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" concern a woman's fear of the downsides of love. The protagonist sings about heartache, and the possibility of a breakup due to the decline of her relationship with an unfaithful lover. She wishes that she did not have to experience this emotional hurt. While her lover is out cheating on her, at home the woman wonders if she has the courage to continue the relationship, \"now that her rock has turned out to be made of mud\", as interpreted by Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music.\nThe protagonist accepts that her feelings for her lover are too strong, and that she does not have the courage to leave him. She decides to fight for her love"

The song was written by Knowles, Terius Nash, Shea Taylor, Ester Dean, Cainon Lamb, Julie Frost, Michael Bivins, Nathan Morris and Wanya Morris, and produced by Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor and Lamb. The song's conception was brought about by Knowles desiring to mix musical styles of the 1990s with the 1970s. It was sent to radio on October 4, 2011 as the fifth single from 4.\nFeaturing a sample of \"Uhh Ahh\" by Boyz II Men, \"Countdown\" incorporates aspects of hip hop, funk, reggae and world music. Lyrically, the female protagonist delivers a message of monogamy to her lover, celebrating self-worthiness as well as appreciating him. Several music critics were surprised by its maturity and compared it to Beyonc\u00e9's earlier solo work and with Destiny's Child. The song finished second in 2011's Pazz & Jop critics' poll and was included on the list of the year's best songs by various critics and publications including Spin, Rolling Stone and The Guardian. \"Countdown\"  peaked at number 71 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also peaked at number 12 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Countdown\" peaked at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart and number nine on the UK R&B Chart.\nAdria Petty directed the accompanying music video, which was recorded whilst Knowles was pregnant in August 2011. The music video sees Beyonc\u00e9 incorporate a mix of classic and modern dances, with references to pieces like that of Audrey Hepburn's appearance in Funny Face. Although well received by critics, the video faced controversy for the use of choreography from Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker's 1983 ballet Rosas danst Rosas. Beyonc\u00e9 performed \"Countdown\" on her 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 and Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live residency shows, as a video interlude on The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and on the set list of The Formation World Tour.\n\"Countdown\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Terius Nash, Shea Taylor, Ester Dean, Cainon Lamb, Julie Frost, Michael Bivins, Nathan Morris and Wanya Morris. Production was handled by Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor and Lamb. Bivins, Morris and Morris are credited as \"Countdown\" samples Boyz II Men's 1991 single, \"Uhh Ahh\". A private listening party for Knowles' fourth studio album was held on May 12, 2011 at the Sony offices in New York City, where one of the five songs previewed was \"Countdown\". While playing the song, Knowles commented: \"[Jay-Z] liked it. I do not think he was dissecting it, just thinking of what he could do to it as a rapper.\"\nOn June 7, 2011, both \"Party\" and \"Countdown\" leaked online, followed by the whole album, three weeks prior to its official release date on June 28, 2011. This was followed by cease-and-desist notices from Beyonc\u00e9's legal team, who forced multiple media sites to remove download links to the songs. Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Knowles' official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and a quote. On June 24, 2011, \"Countdown\" was the ninth song to be chosen. The quote found Beyonc\u00e9 elaborating on the song's inspiration: \"I really liked mixing the 90s with the 70s. I put those two together and it was so much fun putting bridges back into songs, all the things in music that I love that I feel I just want to hear again.\" She also referred to \"Countdown\" as \"really experimental\". Concerning the development \"Countdown\" and the reason for using the sample, Beyonc\u00e9 stated:\nI wanted to do something refreshing and different, so I mixed genres and drew inspiration from touring, traveling, watching rock bands, and attending festivals\u2026 I was like a mad scientist, putting lots of different songs together. Boyz II Men were the first ones to put Destiny's Child on tour. They showed us how to treat an opening act and I will never forget that. That was 15 years ago! Wow, 15 years! I'm old.\nOn September 22, 2011, Columbia Records posted the cover art of \"Countdown\" on the official website of KZII-FM, most commonly known as \"102.5 Kiss FM\". It was the same photograph spread for \"Countdown\" in the album notes for 4 and it was taken by German photographer Ellen von Unwerth. \"Countdown\" impacted both rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on"

It was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Scott Storch and Robert Waller and produced by Storch with guitar played by musician Aaron Fishbein. Beyonc\u00e9 decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song as the third single; the song was sent by Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 19, 2003. \"Me, Myself and I\" is an R&B song about dealing with a philandering partner and learning from the consequences.\nThe live performance of the song from The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience Live was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 2009, and the original version earned Beyonc\u00e9, Storch and Waller an ASCAP Pop Music Award. \"Me, Myself and I\" peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Beyonc\u00e9's fourth consecutive top-five single in the United States. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

World Tour (2009\u201310) and The Formation World Tour (2016)\nAfter the release of her former group Destiny's Child's third studio album Survivor (2001), Beyonc\u00e9 worked on her debut solo studio album, Dangerously in Love. She stated that it was more personal than her previous records because she only had to write for herself. She contacted various musical collaborators, including Storch and Waller. The musical style of \"Me, Myself and I\" is different from the style of her previous singles; Beyonc\u00e9 decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song for the next single. Following the release of the song, Beyonc\u00e9 told Corey Moss of MTV News: \"['Me, Myself and I'] is really powerful. It talks about women basically listening to their inner voice and knowing that they will never disappoint themselves.\"\n\"Me, Myself and I\" was the third single released from Dangerously in Love, which followed \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". It was sent to rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio on October 19, 2003. A CD single was released on October 21, 2003 in the United States, which contained Junior Vasquez's dance radio mix of \"Krazy in Luv\" as its B-side. It officially impacted contemporary hit radio in the United States on November 12, 2003. On December 16, 2003, a 12-inch single was released in the United States. The single was released in selected European countries in January 2004, including Austria, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\"Me, Myself and I\" was released in the United Kingdom as a maxi single on January 12, 2004, as two CD singles and a 12-inch vinyl single; the first disc included a radio edit of the song and \"Dangerously in Love 2\" (2003), and the second one contained two remixes of \"Me, Myself and I\".

The song was also released as a maxi single on January 19, 2004 and later as a three-track single in Germany.\nAccording to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, \"Me, Myself and I\" is an R&B song performed in a moderately slow manner. It is written in the key of D\u266d major; the tempo is set to eighty-four beats per minute, in common time. The chord follows the E\u266dm\u2089-Fm\u2087-G\u266dMaj7 keys, appearing every other bar, and the song has a string arrangement.

Eriksen\nTor Erik Hermansen\nBeyonc\u00e9 Knowles. \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00e9 for her 2008 double album I Am... Sasha Fierce. Written by Beyonc\u00e9, Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, and production duo Stargate, it was initially a classic rhythm and blues song until Babyface changed the arrangement and chords. The track appears on the I Am... disc, the songs on which give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyonc\u00e9's life stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. It is a midtempo R&B ballad accompanied by piano, strings, and drum machine beats. The lyrics describe heartache and the insecurities of love.\nThe song was initially announced as the sixth single from I Am... Sasha Fierce in the United States and the fourth elsewhere, but was replaced with \"Sweet Dreams\". Columbia Records released \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" outside the US on August\u00a028, 2009. Critics praised Beyonc\u00e9's emotional vocals on the track but had divided opinions on the production. The single reached the top twenty on the singles charts of Australia, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Ireland. Sophie Muller directed a monochrome music video in which Beyonc\u00e9's character reminisces about her relationship on a beach in Malibu, California. Beyonc\u00e9 performed \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" on the I Am... World Tour (2009\u201310).\nBeyonc\u00e9 wrote \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" alongside the Norwegian production team Stargate, which consists of Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen. The duo initially composed \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" as a traditional rhythm and blues song but co-writer Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds changed one chord and added falsetto vocals. His recording a demo version preceded a rewrite of the backing track chords and the addition of a four-on-the-floor piano; the result was a \"grand-piano ballad\". According to the sheet music published by EMI, \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" was composed at a tempo of 84\u00a0beats per minute using common time in the key of D minor. Eriksen explained, \"I suppose many of our songs are in minor keys. We probably lean towards more a moody, melodic expression. It's what comes most natural for us.\"\nStargate and Beyonc\u00e9 produced \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" in 2008 at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City. Beyonc\u00e9 arranged & performed the vocals, which Jim Caruana recorded. Eriksen assisted in recording the instrumental track &, along with Hermansen, arranged the music & played the instruments. Mark \"Spike\" Stent and Matt Green then mixed the track. \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" is included on the double album I Am... Sasha Fierce as part of the I Am... disc, which features ballads that describe Beyonc\u00e9's insecurities about love and depict the person she is \"underneath all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama\". Beyonc\u00e9 said she likes to sing ballads because \"the music and the emotion in the story is told  [sic] so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. [On the I Am disc,] I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear what I had to say.\"\n\"Broken-Hearted Girl\" is a midtempo R&B ballad with an airy vocal melody. Beyonc\u00e9's vocals are accompanied by strings, a drum machine beat and a cascading melancholy piano that opens the song. The ballad has a Dm\u2013B\u266d\u2013F(add9)\u2013F\u2013C/E chord progression and a verse-chorus structure. Beyonc\u00e9 sings the introduction in a low vocal register that heightens her vocal power; in the song, her voice ranges from F\u2083 to F\u2085.\nAccording to Beyonc\u00e9, the lyrics of \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" concern a woman's fear of the downsides of love. The protagonist sings about heartache, and the possibility of a breakup due to the decline of her relationship with an unfaithful lover. She wishes that she did not have to experience this emotional hurt. While her lover is out cheating on her, at home the woman wonders if she has the courage to continue the relationship, \"now that her rock has turned out to be made of mud\", as interpreted by Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music.\nThe protagonist accepts that her feelings for her lover are too strong, and that she does not have the courage to leave him. She decides to fight for her love"

It was written by Diane Warren, while production was handled by OneRepublic members Ryan Tedder and Brent Kutzle, alongside Kuk Harrell; while Beyonc\u00e9 is credited on the vocal production. \"I Was Here\" is a reflective R&B ballad, in which Beyonc\u00e9 vulnerably reviews her past, wanting to leave an impact on the world before her life comes to an end. Described as a \"career song\" by Warren, its development was motivated by the September 11 attacks in the United States.\nFollowing the release of 4, \"I Was Here\" charted at number 131 on the UK Singles Chart, 74 on the Swiss Singles Chart, and 44 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart in early July 2011. Later, in 2012, the song also appeared on several charts internationally.\nA music video for the song was released on August 19, 2012 and it features Beyonc\u00e9 performing the song live at the United Nations General Assembly while images of volunteers doing humanitarian work were projected on the screen behind her. It was donated to the World Humanitarian Day and aimed to create social media history with one billion people sharing the message of doing something good for another person. Upon its release, it received positive reviews from music critics who praised the projections, Beyonc\u00e9's vocal performance and her look.\nIn late July, the song was included on the soundtrack for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. \"I Was Here\" was also part of Beyonc\u00e9's set list for her residency show 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 and was used in the Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live shows during an interlude. The live video from the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4 appeared online on November 16, 2011 containing Beyonc\u00e9's home movies and professional highlights. \"I Was Here\" was covered by Lea Michele for Glee's soundtrack album Glee: The Music, The Graduation Album (2012).\n\"I Was Here\" was written by Diane Warren and was produced by Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Beyonc\u00e9 and Kuk Harrell. \"I Was Here\" is the only song on the record that was not co-written by Beyonc\u00e9. On June 1, 2011, Warren revealed in an interview for the New York Post's PopWrap that she wrote \"the best [song she has] ever written\" a week and a half ago and that Beyonc\u00e9 had already recorded it for her fourth studio album 4. She described it as \"a career song and probably my favorite thing I've ever written\". The development of \"I Was Here\" was motivated by the September 11 attacks. Warren wanted to work with Beyonc\u00e9 since the Destiny's Child eras, but admitted that \"I Was Here\" was the ideal timing, \"I thought that the one artist who would be my dream to sing ['I Was Here'] would be Beyonc\u00e9. This is one of those magical stories where what is meant to be actually happens.\"\nIn May 2011, Warren played the song on a guitar over the phone to Beyonc\u00e9's husband Jay-Z, who then called her. Upon hearing \"I Was Here\", Beyonc\u00e9 got chills, and immediately made up her mind, \"Oh my god, I have to have this song.\" September 2011 was going to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and Beyonc\u00e9 thought that the song would perfectly complete her album, which had nearly reached completion. The mastering of 4 was delayed to allow Beyonc\u00e9 to record the song. Warren was present at the recording sessions, which took place two days following her conversation with Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z on the phone. She said, \"There's nothing better than to hear the song that you came up with [sung back]. It's like your heart found another heart\", before adding:\nI've never had chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyonc\u00e9 sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul and became the song that was coming from hers. In all my life, I have never heard anything as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever be one of the best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.\n\"I Was Here\" is a downtempo R&B ballad that is instrumentally based on synthesizers undercurrent, indie rock guitars, musical keyboards and big drums provided by Tedder and Kutzle. The sound of the song's recurring hook uses a combination of a xylophone and a piano. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the"

Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. \"Like a Rolling Stone\" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album Highway 61 Revisited.\nDuring a difficult two-day preproduction, Dylan struggled to find the essence of the song, which was demoed without success in  time. A breakthrough was made when it was tried in a rock music format, and rookie session musician Al Kooper improvised the Hammond B2 organ riff for which the track is known. Columbia Records was unhappy with both the song's length at over six minutes and its heavy electric sound, and was hesitant to release it. It was only when, a month later, a copy was leaked to a new popular music club and heard by influential DJs that the song was put out as a single. Although radio stations were reluctant to play such a long track, \"Like a Rolling Stone\" reached No. 2 in the US Billboard charts (No. 1 in Cashbox) and became a worldwide hit.\nCritics have described \"Like a Rolling Stone\" as revolutionary in its combination of musical elements, the youthful, cynical sound of Dylan's voice, and the directness of the question \"How does it feel?\". It completed the transformation of Dylan's image from folk singer to rock star, and is considered one of the most influential compositions in postwar popular music. According to review aggregator Acclaimed Music, \"Like a Rolling Stone\" is statistically the most acclaimed song of all time. Rolling Stone listed it at No. 1 on their 2004 and 2010 \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" lists. It has been covered by many artists, from the Jimi Hendrix Experience and the Rolling Stones to the Wailers and Green Day. At an auction in 2014, Dylan's handwritten lyrics to the song fetched $2\u00a0million, a world record for a popular music manuscript.\nIn early 1965, after returning from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him and the direction his career was taking, and considered quitting the music business. He said in a 1966 Playboy interview: \"Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation\u00a0... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you.\"\nThe song grew out of an extended piece of verse. In 1966, Dylan described its genesis to journalist Jules Siegel:\nIt was ten pages long. It wasn't called anything, just a rhythm thing on paper all about my steady hatred directed at some point that was honest. In the end it wasn't hatred, it was telling someone something they didn't know, telling them they were lucky. Revenge, that's a better word. I had never thought of it as a song, until one day I was at the piano, and on the paper it was singing, \"How does it feel?\" in a slow motion pace, in the utmost of slow motion.\nDuring 1965, Dylan composed prose, poems, and songs by typing incessantly. Footage in Dont Look Back of Dylan in his suite at London's Savoy Hotel captures this process. However, Dylan told two interviewers that \"Like a Rolling Stone\" began as a long piece of \"vomit\" (10 pages long according to one account, 20 according to another) that later acquired musical form. Dylan has never publicly spoken of writing any other major composition in this way. In an interview with CBC radio in Montreal, Dylan called the creation of the song a \"breakthrough\", explaining that it changed his perception of where he was going in his career. He said that he found himself writing \"this long piece of vomit, 20 pages long, and out of it I took 'Like a Rolling Stone' and made it as a single.

As a single, it was a Top\u00a040 Hit in New Zealand and Belgium. An earlier version of the song, entitled \"Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart\", was recorded for Dylan's 1983 LP, Infidels, but was not included on that album; it later appeared on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991.\n\nAn early version of \"Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)\" was recorded during sessions for Infidels, Dylan's 1983 album, as \"Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart\". A total of thirteen takes of the song were recorded at the Power Station Studio in New York City, in three of the recording sessions, on April 16, April 25 and April 26. On the recording sheet, the song was listed as \"Hold of My Heart\". One of the April 25 takes was released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991.\nThe following musicians played on the recording released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991:\nBob Dylan \u2013 guitar, harmonica, vocals\nMick Taylor \u2013 guitar\nMark Knopfler \u2013 guitar\nAlan Clark \u2013 Keyboards\nRobbie Shakespeare \u2013 bass guitar\nSly Dunbar \u2013 drums\n\nDylan used the basic track from one of the \"Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart\" takes from 1983, and added vocal overdubs in January 1985, including vocals by female backup singers.\nDylan biographer Michael Gray notes that, as elsewhere on the Empire Burlesque album, \"Tight Connection to My Heart\" includes references to a number of lines of dialogue from Humphrey Bogart films. In Sirocco, Bogart says, \"'I've got to move fast: I can't with you around my neck\", which becomes \"Well I had to move fast/And I couldn't with you around my neck\" in the song. Also in Sirocco, Bogart says, \"I don't know whether I'm too good for you or you're too good for me\", changed to \"But I can\u2019t figure out if I\u2019m too good for you/Or if you\u2019re too good for me\" in \"Tight Connection to My Heart\". In The Maltese Falcon, when Bogart's character [Sam Spade] is told \"We wanna talk to you, Spade\", he replies, \"Well, go ahead and talk\"; Dylan turns this into \"You want to talk to me/Go ahead and talk\". Gray writes that Dylan's line \"I\u2019ll go along with the charade/Until I can think my way out\" is said in the movie Tokyo Joe (this line has elsewhere been attributed to another Bogart film, Sahara). A variation on this same line was also used in the Star Trek episode \"The Squire of Gothos\" in 1967. In The Oklahoma Kid, Bogart says to James Cagney: \"I wanna talk to you, kid;\" Cagney replies: \"Go ahead and talk.\" Cagney is later arrested for a crime he didn't commit, and kills two men for attempting to get away when he is arresting them for the crime. The song includes the lines \"You wanna talk to me/Go ahead and talk/I must be guilty of something\" and \"Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest\".\nGray additionally hears references to some non-Bogart films in the song. In Now and Forever, from 1934, Gary Cooper says about some police officers that \"Close up they don\u2019t look as large as they do from a distance;\" in the song this becomes \"What looks large from a distance/Close up ain\u2019t never that big\". Other references are to \"Memphis in June\", the Hoagy Carmichael song used in Johnny Angel, and to the film title Town Without Pity.\nAbout the film references, biographer Clinton Heylin complains of Dylan's \"reliance on the dialogue of Hollywood scriptwriters for any lyrical gaps, as he replaced blazingly original lines from Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart with excerpts from Humphrey Bogart movie scripts\". Jonathan Lethem, contributor to The Cambridge Companion to Bob Dylan, is likewise disappointed that the rewrite \"replaces the original's vulnerable tone with a Bogartishly hardboiled one\". Gray writes that \"these film script snatches...are so unmemorable and unarresting as content yet are mostly so attractive, tersely energetic and imitable as conversational rhythms, and offer cadences of heightened moment: they are great movie lines, in fact, and understandably appealing to [Dylan]\". He adds that, in some of the instances, \"Dylan\u2019s sub-editing, his tightening-up, gives [the lines] their radiance. You might feel that they\u2019re easy building blocks for writer\u2018s-block sufferers, or for singer-songwriters with nothing special to say.

In 1995, Bowie re-recorded the song for his Outside album, and this version was edited and released as the second single from the album, paired with a reworked version of Bowie's 1970 song \"The Man Who Sold the World\".\n\"Strangers When We Meet\" is a song that Bowie recorded 3 times: once in 1993 with Reeves Gabrels and his band Modern Farmer (unreleased), once in 1993 with Bowie's band for release on the album The Buddha of Suburbia, and then again in 1994\u201395 for inclusion on Outside. Both biographers Nicholas Pegg and Chris O'Leary agree that the song seemed out-of-place on Outside: Pegg says that song, \"at the end of 1. Outside's art-rock insanity, 'Strangers When We Meet' seems even more incongruous, resolving all the album's angst and black comedy in a soothing slice of conventional pop\", and O'Leary calls the song \"transient\" and not suited on either of the albums on which it appeared, with the song almost seeming like a bonus track appended at the end of Outside. The Buddha version is called \"tense, more compact, nervier\" compared to the \"lush\" version on Outside.\nWhile the version of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was labeled a \"live version\", it was actually a studio-recorded track based on a reworked version of the song recorded in late October 1995 and performed on the Outside Tour, and mixed by Brian Eno. This version was re-released in 2020 on the EP Is It Any Wonder?\n\"Get Real\" was released as a bonus track to the Japanese release of Outside in 1995, as a b-side to this single, and again on the 2004 re-release of Outside and in the 2007 David Bowie (box set). The song, a leftover from the Outside sessions, was described as a \"far more conventional pop-rock composition than anything on the album\" with a reference to some of Bowie's own \"unlamented\" mid-Eighties work. A sheet of paper dated 6 March 1994, on display at the David Bowie Is exhibit, showed that this song's lyrics were at least partly run through the Verbasizer program, which Bowie liked to use like scissors and paper to cut up and re-arrange his lyrics. Pegg called the song \"an appealing glimpse into the wealth of extra material recorded during the [Outside] sessions, and another example of Bowie's ongoing preoccupation with the nature of reality.\"\nThe single was released in November 1995. While most versions were of the newer Outside version of the song, an American promo CD included a rare single edit of the Buddha of Suburbia version, and a rare 1993 promo cassette contained a different version still of the Buddha recording, and featured different percussion and mixing.\nSamuel Bayer\u2019s video for the song shared some visual similarities with that for \"The Hearts Filthy Lesson\", but was a more simple and placid affair set in a decaying artist's studio.\nIn promotion of the album and single, Bowie performed \"Strangers When We Meet\" four times on various shows in the US and UK. First, on 27 October 1995, it was performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. On 10 November 1995, Bowie performed an unfortunately \"lacklustre\" version of the song on Top of the Pops while in the middle of rehearsals for the Outside Tour, and then played it again on 2 December 1995 on Later... with Jools Holland. It was performed one more time live on TV on 26 January 1996 on French TV's Taratata. Subsequently, the song was performed occasionally during Bowie's 1995\u20131996 Outside Tour and 1997's Earthling Tour. One recording of the song, recorded during the Outside Tour, was released on No Trendy R\u00e9chauff\u00e9 (Live Birmingham 95) (2020), which takes its name from a lyric fragment from the song.\nThe double A-side reached number 39 on the UK charts. In Sweden, \"Strangers When We Meet\" peaked at number 56 in 1996.\nThe 1995 rerecording of the song appeared on the Best of Bowie DVD (2002) and the 3-CD version of Nothing Has Changed (2014).\n\n\"Strangers When We Meet\" (Edit) (Bowie)  \u2013 4:19\n\"The Man Who Sold the World\" (Live) (Bowie)  \u2013 3:35\n\"Strangers When We Meet\" (Edit) (Bowie)  \u2013 4:19\n\"The Man Who Sold the World\" (Live) (Bowie)  \u2013 3:35\n\"Strangers When We Meet\" (Album version) (Bowie)  \u2013 5:06\n\"Get Real\" (Bowie, Eno)\n\"Strangers When We Meet\" (Album version) (Bowie)  \u2013"

The single was first made available at the iTunes Music Store and then was officially released on May 2, 2006. The international radio premiere was April 3, 2006, when Don Jantzen, from the Houston radio station KTBZ-FM, played \"Dani California\" continuously for his entire three-hour program.\nThe single peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the band's third and last single (after \"Under the Bridge\" and \"Scar Tissue\") to enter the top ten. In addition, \"Dani California\" became the second song in history (after R.E.M.'s 1994 track \"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\") to debut at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart, and stayed there for 14 consecutive weeks. It also charted at number one on the Mainstream Rock charts, where it spent twelve straight weeks on top. The song won two Grammy Awards, one for Best Rock Song and the other for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. It also marked the band's joint-biggest UK hit to date along with \"By the Way\", peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart, being kept off number one by Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy\".\nThroughout the song, lyricist Anthony Kiedis laments the early death of Dani, a poor, young Southern girl who eventually lived in California, became a mother and lived a hard, fast, unsettled life. Kiedis has commented that the character of Dani is a composite of all the women with whom he has had relationships. The song narrates much of Dani's life, starting with her birth in Mississippi and apparently culminating with her death in the badlands, by a North Dakota policeman, while en route to Minnesota.\nDani first appeared in the 1999 song \"Californication\", which includes the lyrics \"Teenage bride with a baby inside/Gettin' high on information\" although the girl's name is not specified. She was next mentioned in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2002 single \"By the Way\" as \"Dani the girl\". Kiedis commented: \"When this funky groove came up it struck me as a perfect place to actually tell a story. It sort of revealed itself to me that it's been the same character, just kind of developing. At first I didn't realize that I was writing about the same girl.\"\nGuitarist John Frusciante used various instruments and effects devices in order to achieve the textures and treatments used throughout the song, including Mellotron, Moog effect pedals, and a Doepfer modular synthesizer, used for the filtering and processing of pre-recorded tracks. The one-minute guitar solo at the end of the song is an adaption of Jimi Hendrix's intro to \"Purple Haze\", with the effects kept very close to the original.\nThe working title of the song was \"Wu-Tang\" because Smith's drums sounded similar to those on the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), though they ended up a bit more like Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama\".\nShortly after its release, the originality of the song was questioned on the Dan Gaffney Morning Show on Delaware based news/talk radio station WGMD 92.7 FM. Two of the station's talk show hosts, Dan Gaffney and Jared Morris, alleged that the Red Hot Chili Peppers had plagiarized Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' 1993 hit \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\". To demonstrate, they presented audio snippets of both songs, both side by side and simultaneously (i.e. on top of each other) several times. They stated that the chord progression, key, and the lyrical theme of the songs (both produced by Rick Rubin) showed \"startling similarities\" and urged listeners to \"decide for themselves.\"\nAlthough the chord progressions sound similar, they do in fact differ as \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\" follows \"Am, G, D, Am\" (A Dorian mode), while \"Dani California\" follows \"Am, G, Dm, Am\" (A minor). University of Chicago musicologist Travis Jackson said the songs' chord progressions were similar, but were a \"pretty standard groove\" in music and not necessarily evidence of copying. Other commentators on the controversy point out that the main riff in Petty's song resembles that of a prior song called \"Waiting for the Sun\" which was released in 1992 by The Jayhawks. The Jayhawks were the opening act for Petty's tour in 1992 and keyboardist Benmont Tench played on both \"Waiting for the Sun\" and \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\".\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Petty denied rumors that he planned to sue the"

The song is one of the band's most popular airplay songs and peaked in the top 3 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. It became the joint seventh longest charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, tying with Santana's \"Smooth\" (1999), at 58 consecutive weeks. The song has been certified 3x Platinum by the RIAA, and has sold 4.7 million downloads as of January 2015, the fourth best-selling rock song in digital history.\nIt is the band's highest-charting song to date, topping the Adult Top 40 chart for 15 consecutive weeks and topping the Canadian Airplay Chart. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 2007, but lost to \"Dani California\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers.\nAccording to lead singer Isaac Slade, the song was composed and influenced by his experience while working as a mentor at a camp for troubled teenagers:\nOne of the youngsters I was paired up with was a musician. Here I was, a protected suburbanite, and he was just 17 and had all these problems. And no one could write a manual on how to save him.\nSlade claims that the song is about all of the people that tried to reach out to the boy but were unsuccessful. As Slade says in an interview, the boy's friends and family approached him by saying, \"Quit taking drugs and cutting yourself or I won't talk to you again,\" but all he needed was some support. The boy was losing friends and going through depression. He lost his best friend and could not deal with it. The verses of the song describe an attempt by an adult to confront a troubled teen. In the chorus, the singer laments that he himself was unable to save a friend because he did not know how.\nWhile this was the original intent of the song, the band has opened the song to interpretation. They created a website where fans were welcome to submit music videos they had made for the song. This arose from the response that Slade got from the song:\nI got a lot of e-mails about it (...) One boy died in a car accident, and I guess it had been the last song he downloaded from his computer. They played it at his funeral, and some of his friends got Save a life tattooed on their arms. The response has been overwhelming.\nDuring an interview in Sauce, Bob Wilson asked Slade, \"'How to Save a Life' was apparently inspired by an experience you had as a mentor to a boy who had a drug problem. What's the story behind that?\" Slade answered:\nWell there's a group home here in Denver called Shelterwood, and it takes in teens who've had a tough time; their parents don't want to send them to jail, but they can't keep track of them themselves... A friend of mine was actually the president for that particular school, so he asked Joe and I to come up for one of their weekend retreats... I was paired up with one boy in particular. His story was just amazing \u2013 all the relationships that he had put at risk because of the decisions he made, and eventually losing the relationships... the cost of his lifestyle and his choices, and kind of relating them to my own life and my own stories; seeing all the relationships I've threatened for one reason or another. It was a really inspiring weekend.\nThe song is the band's first to achieve significant popularity outside of the United States. \"How to Save a Life\" was a top five hit in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. \nDue to an early leak by BBC Radio 1 in the United Kingdom, where it was the band's debut single, the song was released in the territory five weeks earlier than planned. It debuted at number twenty nine on the UK Singles Chart on January 21, 2007, via downloads alone. Instead of its planned release date which was to be March 26, 2007, the single was physically released in the United Kingdom on February 28 and gradually rose up the chart, reaching number five on February 25, staying there for four weeks. It eventually peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart on April 8 and became Britain's eleventh biggest-selling song of 2007. On March 29, \"How to Save a Life\" peaked at number 1 in Ireland, becoming their first and only number one single in the country to date. The song only stayed at the top spot for a week but sales still proved strong after it fell from number 1.\nThe song was ranked No. 24 on Billboard's Best Adult Pop Songs of the Decade, and No. 47 on Billboard's Top 100 Digital Tracks of the Decade.

It was written and produced by Cory Rooney, Lopez, and Benny Medina, with additional writing from Chris Brown, Pitbull, Diplo, and others. \"Booty\" samples \"Dat a Freak\", a song by Diplo and Swick, and it features Lopez's frequent collaborator Pitbull. Initially entitled \"Big Booty\", the song was first rejected by Lopez who did not like the idea of having a song with a title like that. However, after playing the demo for her kids and seeing that they enjoyed the track, Lopez was convinced to record it.\n\"Booty\" is a dance track, with a Middle Eastern vibe, heavy percussion and an Asian keyboard riff, while its lyrics portrait Lopez inviting girls to the dancefloor to have a good time and dance, while shaking their buttocks. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, with many complimenting the song's fun nature, the dance environment and Pitbull's appearance, but a few dismissed its concept. Commercially, \"Booty\" performed moderately worldwide. It became a top twenty hit in the United States, charting at number eighteen on the US Billboard Hot 100, and entered the top forty in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among other music markets.\n\"Booty\" performed a snippet of the track during a concert and eventually premiered it full at an Orchard Beach concert. She has also performed \"Booty\" on Good Morning America and at Fashion Rocks. A one-minute teaser clip for the track was released on June 13, 2014, and it features Lopez and a group of women twerking. The teaser-video received high praise for its visuals and choreography, while Lopez was complimented by critics for looking rejuvenated and younger.\n\"Booty\" was officially remixed with vocals from Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, replacing those of Pitbull. It was released as the third single from the album on August 24, 2014. The remix received generally positive reviews from critics, who commended Azalea for adding an explosive verse to the song. The music video for the remix was shot in Los Angeles in late August, and was directed by Hype Williams. It premiered on September 18, 2014, and it shows Lopez and Azalea dancing in revealing swimming costumes, before being drenched with water. Lopez and Azalea performed \"Booty\" for the first time together on live television at the American Music Awards on November 23, 2014.\nIn 2014, Lopez received a demo of a song called \"Big Booty\", produced by Diplo, and was encouraged to record the track, with everybody indicating that it was the type of track she needed to do. However, Lopez claimed: \"Never in my life will I do a song called 'Big Booty', it would never happen,\" explaining that she felt it was going to be a joke and the album was very important. After some reluctance, Lopez ended up writing the track and played the demo in her car to see if it would work. While playing some tracks in her car, with her twins, Lopez stated that they instantly loved that the track: \"As soon as they heard 'Big Booty' they went crazy. They loved this song and because of that I recorded it,\" she admitted. During a brunch where she debuted multiple songs from A.K.A., Lopez spoke of the track, saying: \"I didn't allow myself to be put in a box. On this album, I did all of it.

Released in 2009, it was written and produced by Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea and Marcel Botezan. Musically, the single is of the dance genre, and originally contained the vocals of Romanian singer Alessia. However, after a feud over compensation between Taylor and her, the song was handed to Inna, although the early version had already been released.\nWhen premiering the new version of \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\", Taylor and Inna opted for pseudonyms before revealing their identity later. In order to accompany the single, a music video was shot at a club in Neptun, Romania by Tom Boxer, and it initially did not feature Inna until another version of the visual showed footage of her in Turkey. Commercially, the recording experienced success in European countries, reaching the top ten of the charts in Greece, the Commonwealth of Independent States, France and Romania, among others. \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" was certified Gold by the Dutch Association of Producers and Importers of Image and Sound Carriers (NVPI) for selling over 10,000 copies in the Netherlands.\nInitially, a version of the song featuring the vocals of Romanian singer Alessia was released in early 2009, and drew comparisons to Inna's \"Hot\" (2008) at that time. The track was further credited to Bogdan Croitoru, also known as Fizz, which opted for the pseudonym of Bob Taylor. However, following a dispute over compensation, the artists decided to quit their collaboration and Alessia demanded her vocals to be replaced with others, although \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" had already experienced commercial success in Romania and had been heavily played in night clubs. Particularly, the track was handed to Inna to re-record. According to Alessia, whose voice is a semi-tone higher than Inna's, the latter had a disadvantage when re-recording the song as it was not in her tonality, and this could not be changed because the track was already finished.\nThe new version of the dance single with Inna's vocals was initially made available for consumption as credited to Bob Taylor and Anni (backwards to Inna), as the artists wanted to \"stay in the shade\" reportedly because \"the Romanian audience has some bias\". Following a time of speculation and controversy, the performers of the recording were finally revealed, with Inna writing on her website; \"I consider that a good song can be promoted and listened to without knowing by whom it is composed or who interprets it. With the help of 'D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu', I have showed this thing and, look, again, you \u2013 the audience \u2013 had the biggest intake. I thank you and don't forget that you are the only ones that can make a hit out of a song.\"\nAn accompanying music video for \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" was shot by Tom Boxer in a club in Neptun, Romania. It was filmed in the period of Alessia's and Croitoru's argument over compensation, with Inna initially not appearing in it, before another version was released on 7 November 2009 incorporating footage of the singer in Turkey. The visual opens with a glass falling down in front of a black backdrop, with it breaking, and then sees Taylor mixing in a club. Following this, the focus alternates on female strippers and a group of partying people. Subsequently, a girl sporting an orange dress walks around the club, eventually drawing the attention of a male, with her sitting at the bar and watching a man mixing drinks. After the group of people\u2014including masked men\u2014further perform to the track, the clip ends with a shot of one's white T-shirt with an unknown blue figure on it. Scenes interspersed through the main clip portray Inna posing in swimsuit during a ship trip, footage of loudspeakers or two topless men fighting sporting yellow pants.\nUpon its release, \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" experienced commercial success in Europe. On the native Nielsen Music Control chart, the song peaked at number seven in August 2009, and further reached the top ten in various territories. While the recording achieved a peak position at number two in Greece, it charted at number four in the Commonwealth of Independent States, and in France, where it has sold 15,400 registered copies as of 2010, it became Inna's third top ten single at number six. Additionally, on Spain's PROMUSICAE chart, \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" debuted at number 31 on 2 May 2010 and climbed to number 15 on 15 August 2010, lasting for 26 consecutive weeks.

The lyrical content of the song revolves around Lopez's love to dance for her man. The song was due to be released as a promotional single to help promote the album on April 19, 2011, but the song was unlocked and released on April 17, 2011, through a campaign on Lopez's Facebook page. \"Papi\" received praise from music critics, stating that it was one of the highlights from Love?\n\"Papi\" received a full commercial release as Love?'s third single in September and October 2011. On October 27, 2011 \"Papi\" became Lopez's 11th number one single on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs Chart. A music video was released for the song and it was directed by Paul Hunter, who had previously worked with her for videos including her 2000 hit \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\". The plot of the video involves Jennifer Lopez eating a mysterious love cookie, and the next morning a mob of men go crazy for her, chasing her all over the city. The song was also used as the opening number of Miss Earth 2011.\n\"Papi\" is a Latin and electro-flavored, up-tempo dance track written by Bilal Hajji, AJ Junior and Teddy Sky, co-written and produced by BeatGeek, RedOne and Jimmy Joker. The melody is driven by \"beating\" drums and \"pounding\" synths. According to Rick Florino, from Artistdirect.com, the song also uses elements of \"propulsive house\" music. The lyrics center around Lopez's love for dancing for her man. Florino described the song's middle-8 breakdown as \"a bass thump and seductive Spanish lines [that] pulsate in tandem before one final crescendo of the chorus.\" On the line \"My rock is shinin\u2019 bright / Even if he ain\u2019t by my side / He makes sure that I glow / I make sure everybody knows,\" J. Lo sings of her man, who is not around the club but whose presence is sparkling on her finger. It was scheduled for release on April 19, 2011 as the third of four promotional singles. \"I'm Into You\" was subsequently confirmed as the album's second single. The track was released three days early, after a preview was posted on Lopez's \"Like for Love?\" campaign, whereby the Love?'s three promotional singles were released early if enough fans \"liked\" them through Facebook. The opening portion of the song is used in the dance-breakdown present in the music video for Lopez's second Love? single, \"I'm Into You\" (2011).\nStaff from entertainment website Idolator said \"While this track, like 'On the Floor,' doesn't bring anything new to the dance party table, that isn't really a problem. This track is totally club-ready and there's no reason why it shouldn't play just as well as 'On the Floor'.\" Joe Guerra from The Houston Chronicle agreed calling the song one of Love?'s \"best moments.\" Rick Florino, from Artistdirect.com, gave the song a positive review, saying that on the song, \"Lopez [is] at her finest\". In his review, Florino praised Lopez's voice, noting that it \"pulsates with a fresh, fiery, and focused energy\" while also commenting that \"her unique delivery brandishes traditional Latin flare, [that] captivates listeners hypnotically.\" He ended by praising the song's memorable chorus and \"majestic hook.\" Monica Herrera wrote favorably for Billboard that: \"The pro-monogamy house trend revived by RiRi's \"Only Girl,\" still going strong here. Fun, harmless, & strictly for Jenny's Latina fans.\" \"Pop Crush\"'s Amanda Hensel rated it four-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote that: \"Papi is spicy hot \u2014 just like the Puerto Rican, Bronx-raised herself.\" [...] \"It's a perfect fit for any club packed full of dance-hungry people, and all-in-all, exemplifies what we love about the singer/actress.\"\nBBC Music's Alex McApherson wrote that: \"The woman who gave us the supreme millennial house of Waiting for Tonight will know her way around On the Floor and Papi, both apparent distillations of the trashy Miami house aesthetic that dominates pop these days.\" Entertainment Weekly's Adam Markovitz wrote that the album is \"a harmless collection of prefab dance pop with just enough hints of Latin spice to remind listeners of Jenny's from-the-block past (see: the stoop-party-ready Papi) without losing sight of her Bel Air present.\" IGN Music's Chad Grischow positively wrote that \"The album is at its best when the"

It was released as the second single from the album on April 7, 2009. \"We Made You\" was written by Eminem, Andre Young, Dawaun Parker, Mark Batson, Trevor Lawrence Jr. and Walter Egan. Production was handled by Dr. Dre, with Eminem and Doc Ish serving as additional co-producers.\n\"We Made You\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, and became a success, peaking inside the Top 10 in fourteen countries and at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100. Just like \"Shake That\", this single is known for being a departure from the serious tone of his second released singles from his previous albums such as \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\", \"The Way I Am\" and \"Like Toy Soldiers\", instead having a more comedic tone.\nIt features chorus vocals by Charmagne Tripp. Produced by Dr. Dre and co-produced by Doc Ish and Eminem himself, the song samples \"Hot Summer Nights\" by Walter Egan. The official cover for the single is a picture of the music video, with Eminem, Oxen, Lisa Ann and Bobby Lee.\n\"We Made You\" has generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone magazine gave it a positive review stating, \"It's nice to see Eminem goofing around again after a few years out of the spotlight during which he grappled with serious issues like the death of his friend Proof, and 'We Made You' with its damnation of current celebrities will likely prove to be a solid pop cultural time capsule of this weird 2009 moment we're experiencing now.\" Billboard said, \"Atop Dr. Dre's marching beat is primarily piano instrumentation, which amid drums and tubas give the track a carnival feel... And in case his word play was too fast and strange accent too difficult to decipher, Charmagne Tripp sings the chorus.\" Tim Jonze of The Guardian however, reported, \"'We Made You' is not Eminem doing what he does best.\"\n\"We Made You\" sold 167,000 downloads in its first week to enter the Hot Digital Songs chart in Billboard Magazine at number three. The song also debuted at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, to become Eminem's second top ten in a row on the chart, ranked \"Crack a Bottle\", a collaboration with Dr. Dre and 50 Cent. This marks the first time that Eminem has had back-to-back top-ten hits on the Hot 100 as a lead artist since 2002, when he scored with \"Without Me\", \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" and \"Lose Yourself\". \"We Made You\" has reached the top ten in twelve countries, including number one in Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and Germany.\n\nThe single's music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who also shot \"Without Me\" from The Eminem Show is in the same vein as previous videos under the Slim Shady persona, and the first of its kind since Encore's \"Ass Like That\". The video was filmed in Las Vegas and features guest star appearances by Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, Denaun Porter, Bobby Lee, The Palms hotel owner George Maloof, Francesca Le (playing Kim Kardashian), Melissa Peterman, Vanilla Ice, Trisha Paytas (playing Jessica Simpson's role in The Dukes of Hazzard), Derrick Barry (of America's Got Talent fame) (playing Britney Spears), actress Gabrielle Salinger (playing Amy Winehouse) and pornographic actress Lisa Ann (playing Sarah Palin). The music video for \"We Made You\" premiered on April 7, 2009 at 6:00 AM on several MTV networks, as well as MTV.com. The video also premiered on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom on the next day.\nThe music video parodies TV shows Rock of Love and Star Trek (with the Starfleet insignia replaced with an inverted 2nd Infantry Division), as well as video game Guitar Hero with Eminem against an imitation version background of the notes while the homage to film Rain Man was shot at The Palms, a film Eminem has previously referenced in his lyrics. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is also homaged. On April 3, 2009, Eminem talked about the music video in an MTV News interview, stating that there is some \"Celebrity bashing in it\", which is often a feature of his album's lead singles. Celebrities mocked include Bret Michaels, Kevin Federline, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Samantha Ronson, Amy Winehouse and her then-husband Blake Fielder-Civil, Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Jessica Alba, Elvis Presley, Tony Romo, John Mayer, Jennifer Aniston, and Kim Kardashian.

The song, released on August 27, 2013, is the first single from Eminem's eighth studio album The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The song was produced by Rick Rubin and samples Billy Squier's \"The Stroke\", as well as the Beastie Boys' \"Fight for Your Right\", taken from their 1986 debut album Licensed to Ill, which Rubin had also produced, and Naughty by Nature's \"Feel Me Flow\".

Music critic Craig Rosen. The song samples the \"Kick it!\" part of \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)\", performed by Ad-Rock. According to Billboard's Lars Brandle, the song is \"a punchy, guitar-and-beats driven song which channels Joan Jett & the Blackhearts' I Love Rock 'n' Roll and Licensed to Ill-era Beastie Boys.\"\nDuring the halftime at the September 7, 2013 Michigan\u2013Notre Dame football game, Eminem premiered a preview of the music video for \"Berzerk\". Then the video was premiered two days later on September 9, via VEVO. The video was filmed in Brooklyn, New York and directed by Syndrome. It features cameo appearances from fellow American rappers Kendrick Lamar and Kid Rock (both of whom Eminem mentions in the song's lyrics) in addition to Shady Records labelmates Slaughterhouse, Mr. Porter, Yelawolf and The Alchemist, the song's producer Rick Rubin and Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg. The video also features short clips of backyard wrestling, and public fights as well as short clips of the official music video of Billy Squier's \"The Stroke\", which is heavily sampled in the song. The video received a nomination at MTV Video Music Awards 2014 in the category \"Best Hip-Hop Video\".\n\"Berzerk\" originally premiered on August 26, on SiriusXM channel, Shade 45. The Marshall Mathers LP 2, a sequel to Eminem's acclaimed studio effort The Marshall Mathers LP, was revealed during MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, 2013 with two previews of \"Berzerk\" via Beats By Dr. Dre commercials. Some critics describe Eminem's return in these commercials as the highlight of the show. The video that accompanied the song featured a boombox prominently.

The song has peaked at number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. When the R&B component of the chart is removed, the song debuted at number one on the Rap Songs chart. \"Berzerk\"'s debut is just below the debut of the lead single for Recovery, \"Not Afraid\", which sold 379,000 copies in its first week. It has sold over a million copies in the US as of October 2013.\nIn Canada, the song debuted at number two with 50,000 downloads sold, which more than doubled the 24,000 downloads sold in the debut week of \"Not Afraid\". It was Eminem's best one week download total ever in the country, until it was surpassed by the 54,000 downloads sold for Eminem's later single, \"The Monster\". The song was certified Double Platinum in Digital downloads in Canada on November 1, 2013.\nThe song debuted at number one on the UK R&B Chart and was replaced on the chart by his single \"Rap God\".\nWill Hermes of Rolling Stone gave the song 4 out of 5 stars, highlighting its goal to \"celebrate old-school hip-hop\". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song 4 out of 5 stars, stating the song \"harks back\" to Eminem's \"Slim Shady days\". Copsey compared the song to Beastie Boys circa 1986, although the song as \"inimitable\" and \"unmistakably Eminem\". VH1 India gave the song 8/10 concluding, \"Whether you shudder under 'Berzerk's' cacophonous assault or wear its raps like an emblem \u2014 it's 2013, and Eminem still got your"

The music video for \"We Made You\" premiered on April 7, 2009 at 6:00 AM on several MTV networks, as well as MTV.com.

Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is also homaged. On April 3, 2009, Eminem talked about the music video in an MTV News interview, stating that there is some \"Celebrity bashing in it\", which is often a feature of his album's lead singles.

The song is included in the soundtrack for the 2016 film Suicide Squad.\nThe song was Eminem's return after the successful The Marshall Mathers LP, intended as a sequel to \"The Real Slim Shady\" and essentially says that he is back to save the world. It also refers to Eminem's role in the music industry and his effect on culture.\nThe song mocks a number of Eminem's critics, including then-Vice-President Dick Cheney (including his recurring heart problems) and his wife Lynne, the FCC, Chris Kirkpatrick (of NSYNC), Limp Bizkit and Moby, as well as parodying Prince's decision to change his name to a symbol. It also lampoons comparisons of him to Elvis Presley as a white man succeeding commercially in a predominantly black art form. A line also attacks his mother Debbie Mathers for the lawsuit she filed for the lyrics of his debut single \"My Name Is\".\nThe opening lyric \"Two trailer park girls go round the outside\" is based on the country rap single \"Buffalo Gals\" by Malcolm McLaren. The introduction\u2014\"Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks\"\u2014is sampled from Obie Trice's own track \"Rap Name\".\nStephen Thomas Erlewine marked it as one of the best tracks on The Eminem Show. David Browne was positive: \"'I've created a monster, 'cuz no one wants to hear Marshall no more,' he (Eminem) whines, partly in jest, in the beat-crazy single 'Without Me'.\" HipHopDX noted that the blazing single \"Without Me\" is one of the only light-hearted songs on the album. NME magazine noted that this song is \"tackling disco.\" RapReviews wrote: \"His (Eminem's) fearlessness continues on the lead single \"Without Me\" when he lambasts everyone from Dick Cheney's wife to the leading electronic artists of the day.\" Kris Ex exclaims: \"\"Without Me\"\u2014like his \"The Real Slim Shady,\" the leadoff single from 2000's The Marshall Mathers LP\u2014is a fun-loving, barb-laden romp on which he flits from one topic to the next like a bumblebee with ADD.\"\n\"Without Me\" is one of Eminem's most successful singles. The song reached the number one position in the charts in numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand for 7 weeks. In the United States, the song reached a peak of number two on the Billboard Hot 100 behind \"Hot in Herre\" by Nelly, although it reached number one on both the Mainstream Top 40 and Rhythmic charts.\n\"Without Me\" was nominated for Record of the Year at the Grammy Awards of 2003 (losing to Norah Jones's song \"Don't Know Why\"), being Eminem's first song to receive a Grammy nomination in a major category. It also received a nomination for Best Male Rap Solo Performance but lost that award as well to the song \"Hot in Herre\" by rapper Nelly.\nIn 2009, the song was honored by Pitchfork Media as the 251st-greatest song of the 2000s.\nThe song was the 69th-best-selling single of the 2000s in the United Kingdom.\nThe song's music video features a number of scenarios built around its context, including Eminem and Dr. Dre as parodies of comics in general, specifically Batman, Robin (Rap Boy), and Blade trying to save a child who bought a copy of The Eminem Show that has a Parental Advisory sticker. Eminem and his band of heroes rush to the rescue before the child puts the CD in his CD player and when they arrive Rap Boy snatches it away from him, showing that his CD has explicit lyrics that are not suitable for him to listen to. The kid cries and is upset after Rap Boy and Blade (Dr Dre) confiscate the album away from him. The video was shot from April 12\u201313 at Barwick Studios. The comic panel contains the rabbit from You're a Superstar. Early on, Eminem appears throughout some of the video where he is on a hospital bed being pushed through a ward (a reference to ER, which here is called \u018eM drawing from the rapper's stage name).

It was released on 18 March 2016. The single was serviced to US contemporary hit and rhythmic contemporary radio on 5 April 2016. Azalea wrote \"Team\" with Bebe Rexha, Lauren Christy, among other credited composers, including the main producers, a part of the D.R.U.G.S. collective: Marlon \"Chordz\" Barrow, Alexander \"Nezzo\" Palmer and Michael \"Omega\" Fonseca, with additional contributors Ryan Anthony Avilez, Louis Harden and Brandon \"Stix\" Salaam-Bailey. The song contains an interpolation from the 1999 composition \"Back That Thang Up\", written and performed by Juvenile, Lil Wayne and Mannie Fresh.\nAzalea raps about self-confidence in the track, declaring, \"Baby I got me, and that\u2019s all I need, only friend I need,\" with the rapper later disclosing life and career struggles she had faced during the process of creating the album in an interview. It marked Azalea's first solo single in three years. The release was accompanied by the premiere of a dance video version on Azalea's Vevo channel, featuring a cast of dancers performing a choreographed routine, although Azalea herself is absent from the clip. The song's official music video premiered on 31 March 2016. \"Team\" reached the top forty in Australia, becoming her ninth single to do so. It debuted and peaked at number forty-two on the US Billboard Hot 100, staying on the chart for eight weeks. The track also earned Azalea's highest debut as a lead act on the Hot Rap Songs chart with its arrival at number eight and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) later that year. \"Team\" was nominated for Choice R&B/Hip-Hop Song at the 2016 Teen Choice Awards. As of October 2019, \"Team\" has garnered over 300 million streams worldwide across all platforms.\nIn October 2015, Azalea announced her second studio album was titled Digital Distortion and set be released in the following year, along with a buzz track titled \"Zillion\" and the project's lead single premiering before its release. In December, during a Twitter Q&A with fans, she revealed that the lead single would be titled \"Team\", later sharing a snippet of the track and clarifying: \"lead is TEAM. meaning: I've got my own back, I am my own team. 20% meaningful 70% bop 10% ratchet.\" In March 2016, she announced the song would be released on 18 March and unveiled the single's cover artwork, a \"colorfully distorted\" portrait of Azalea with a white cap. She also shared a second snippet featuring Azalea chanting the lyrics: \"Yeah, that's all I need/ That's all I need/ Baby I got me, only friend I need/ Playing on my team is someone like me.\"\nDuring an interview with etalk that same month, Azalea commented while talking about her upcoming album, \"My first single has no feature on it which was my number one goal, to try to achieve a song which was strong without needing somebody else to sing it.\" \"It was good to get back to doing a song where I only had to consider myself when creating,\" elaborating later on how her experience influenced the making of the track, \"If I'm gonna have everyone try to come at me, then I have to support my own self and I have to be strong on my own and I don't need all of that extra stuff. I'm just gonna rock it myself.\" On 14 March, she continued teasing the track on Twitter posting another preview addressing: \"Kylie Jenner, we know you're technically a Jenner, but you're still a Kardashian in our hearts,\" with the pun lyrics, \"Watch a new car dash/ Call me Kylie.\" On March 18, a \"dance video\" for \"Team\" was uploaded on Azalea's Vevo channel and the song became available for digital download on iTunes. Following the release, it topped the real-time Billboard + Twitter Trending 140 chart, becoming the \"most shared and discussed track on the social-media network for five straight hours through noon ET.\"\n\"Team\" is an electro hop song. The chorus is sung by Azalea; lyrically it discusses the rapper's independence and self-confidence, sung over \"commanding, head-knocking\" drums according to Rap-Up. Along with the independent woman theme, it also conveys a \"warning to not mess with\" Azalea's clique. Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson at Digital Spy pondered the song to be \"both lonely and inclusive,\" as Azalea positions herself as \"both a one-woman army and a leader ready to"

It was released as the third single from his debut album, The College Dropout. The song was written and produced by West and features singer Syleena Johnson. The hip hop song contains an interpolation of \"Mystery of Iniquity\" by Lauryn Hill from her live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, therefore Hill is credited as a composer. \nIt was released in February 2004 and entered the UK Singles Chart at number ten and peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 on May 11, 2004, his first solo Top 10 hit in the USA. The song was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 47th Grammy Awards, Viewer's Choice at the 2004 BET Awards and received nominations for a total of four awards at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards.\nThe song contains an interpolation of \"Mystery of Iniquity\" by Lauryn Hill from her live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0. West originally attempted to acquire legal clearance to sample the recording but due to various complications, the permission was withheld. West then called upon Syleena Johnson to re-sing the relevant vocal portions of \"Mystery of Iniquity\" which ended up in the final track. The version of the song with the original sample can be heard on West's Freshman Adjustment mixtape. However, the earliest version of the song can be found on West's 2001 mixtape The Prerequisite, on which it called \"Dream Come True\". Lyrically, \"All Falls Down\" examines the self-consciousness and insecurity within society, particularly the black community, and how these characteristics pertain to economic materialism.\nIn a 2013 interview with The New York Times, West revealed Dead Prez's impact on the song;\n\"It wasn\u2019t until I hung out with Dead Prez and understood how to make, you know, raps with a message sound cool that I was able to just write \u201cAll Falls Down\u201d in 15 minutes.\u201d\nWest performed the song live on Def Poetry Jam in 2004 as a poem titled \"Self Conscious\". A performance of \"All Falls Down\" was included on West's 2006 live album Late Orchestration, which was recorded in 2005 at Abbey Road Studios in London. It was performed live by West in 2015 as the closer to his headlining set at Glastonbury.\nThe song was performed by West as part of a medley at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, as well on numerous television shows, including; Late Show with David Letterman, Total Request Live, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and Later... with Jools Holland.\nThe music video for \"All Falls Down\" was directed by Chris Milk and shot at Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California. It follows West as he accompanies his girlfriend, played by Stacey Dash, to the airport to catch her flight. The video is shot in first-person perspective, displaying the journey from their car to the airport terminal through West's eyes. The music video also features cameos by GLC, Consequence, Common,  Kel Mitchell, and Syleena Johnson, who features on the song, as the lady who checks Dash in at the airport reception. Complex named it the 18th best music video of the 2000s decade.\n\"All Falls Down\" is placed as the fourth song of Kanye West's debut studio album, The College Dropout. The album is notable for containing complex societal issues, which West strives to advertently cover in ways relating to the Black American community. These thematic concepts, prevalent through the entirety of the album, are omnipresent within this specific song.\nWest in \"All Falls Down\" decides to vulnerably share his own imperfections. This shines through his divulge into chronic issues with personal insecurities, which he recognizes as a problem that relates to the greater population within society than just himself. Within the concept of insecurities, West makes the decision to specifically hone in on the continuous, dividing matter of excessive materialism, or a desire of it, in attempt to pertain to an affluent appearance. While focusing on this topic, he admits that although being subject to this affair, he knowingly understands the mindset contradictory to such a lifestyle pertaining to short-term, consumerist happiness. Yet, he still finds himself to be a participant in this way of life.\nWest also ties this thematic idea to an even deeper, underlying meaning. The reason this lifestyle is endeavored is in an attempt to recompense for"

I'm just gonna rock it myself.\" On 14 March, she continued teasing the track on Twitter posting another preview addressing: \"Kylie Jenner, we know you're technically a Jenner, but you're still a Kardashian in our hearts,\" with the pun lyrics, \"Watch a new car dash/ Call me Kylie.\" On March 18, a \"dance video\" for \"Team\" was uploaded on Azalea's Vevo channel and the song became available for digital download on iTunes.

The song was digitally and physically released on 11 April 2014. \"Up!\" was written by Jade, Zac Poor and Mario Marchetti, and produced by Marchetti. It became her fifth top twenty hit since winning The X Factor Australia in 2012. On 12 March 2014, \"Up!\" was announced as the official Socceroos song for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. It was also used to promote the sixth season of X Factor Australia.\nOn 11 March 2014, it was announced that Samantha Jade had written and recorded \"Up!\" as the official anthem of the Australian football team for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. \"Up!\" is an up-tempo, dance-pop song, co-written by Jade, Zac Poor and Mario Marchetti, with Marchetti serving as producer. Jade explained how the name of the song came about during writing sessions, saying: \"When we were writing it we wanted something up-tempo and uplifting, so the word 'up' was the place to start.\" The track, which was recorded in Sydney, Australia in early 2014, drew inspiration from words in a book written by the players \"documenting what it means to be a Socceroo.\" Jade described the recording as a \"celebration-type record - it's about turning up the night and making the most out of things\", feeling that it was a perfect song for the Socceroos.\n\"Up!\" was released as a digital download and CD single on 11 April 2014. The physical single contained Jades cover of \"Never Tear Us Apart\" by INXS as a b-side. \"Up!\" debuted at number eighteen on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart on 27 April 2014, and was the highest debut of the week.

Shame on Sony Australia!!!\" while Take 40 Australia said, \"For a song that is supposed to be the official Soccerros anthem for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, the clip looks generic, boring and unauthentic \u2013 all things which Samantha Jade and 'Up!' are not!.\"\nA second video was released on 3 May, titled \"The Socceroos Mix\" and included clips of the Socceroos matches over the past decade to the original audio.\nJade promoted \"Up!\" on television and radio, including Sunrise and on KIIS 106.5, respectively.

We were in the studio, we were writing and I was like, 'Ugh I can't breathe.' And they were like, 'We're going to write this song.'

Vulture editor Dee Locket explained why \"Focus\" was not included on the album's final cut; the song's rollout was not \"remembered as a success \u2013 it was calculated to a fault, too polished for a time when pop's biggest stars, particularly its women, were letting their flaws bleed into the music.\"\nAccording to sheet music published by Kobalt Music on Musicnotes.com, \"Focus\" was written in the key of G\u266f minor and set in  time at a moderate tempo of 98 beats per minute. Grande's voice ranges from C\u266f\u2084 to G\u266f\u2085. A retro-styled song, \"Focus\" is based on a 1970s-inspired dance beat.

It was released digitally in the United States on April 7, 2009, to US radio on April 28, 2009, and in the UK on August 10, 2009. The song contains a sample of Steam's \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\". An uptempop dance pop track, the lyrics of the song deal with DeBarge getting over her ex-boyfriend. A music video was released to promote the song, which features DeBarge and her friends stealing her ex-boyfriend's car and driving to various locations, including a house party. Throughout the video, DeBarge is seen flirting with several men in an attempt to get back at her ex-boyfriend.\nDespite the mixed critical reception, it achieved some commercial success, peaking in the top forty in Sweden and the top twenty in Canada and the United States, but it fared better as a dance single, peaking at number three on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Despite the minimal chart performance of the single, it has become her biggest hit to date, as well as her only single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US.\n\"Goodbye\" was one of the first songs that was recorded for the album. During an interview with TheStarScoop, DeBarge said of the first time she heard the song on the radio,\n\"I was screaming up and down. I was actually at home and listening to New York Radio Online. I had called all my friends, telling them to listen. My mom video taped me. It was really surreal for me. Every time I hear my song on the radio, I just take it in and [it's] so cool. It\u2019s me!\"\n\n\"Goodbye\" is generally considered a pop-dance track. J!-ENT described the song as \"an upbeat, addictive track utilizing the classic 1969 Steam track \u201cNa Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\u201d. A wonderful debut single for Kristinia.\" People magazine praised the song and compared it to recent releases by Rihanna, stating \"First single 'Goodbye', an undeniable dance-pop confection, recalls Rihanna's 'S.O.S.

It was released on September 25, 2012, as the lead single from her second studio album, Warrior (2012). Kesha co-wrote the song with its producers, Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, and Cirkut, with additional writing from Nate Ruess, the lead singer of Fun. Kesha wrote the lyrics after traveling around the world and embarking on a spiritual journey.\n\"Die Young\" charted in multiple countries, debuting at 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. In its third week, \"Die Young\" broke into the Hot 100's top-ten, making it Kesha's seventh consecutive top-ten hit as a lead artist since her debut on the chart in 2010 with \"Tik Tok\" and ninth top-ten hit overall including her collaborations with 3OH!3, Britney Spears, and Nicki Minaj. It eventually peaked at number two, continuing Kesha's string of top-ten singles. The song has also reached the top ten in multiple countries worldwide, including most of the English-speaking world and has received a Platinum certification in five countries.\nIn December 2012, the song was removed from some radio stations in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.\nProduced primarily by Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco, Kesha worked with the lead singer of fun., Nate Ruess, to write \"Die Young\". Co-producer Blanco called the song \"old hippie rock.\" The song was written in 2011, after Kesha traveled the world. Before working on her second studio album, she went on a spiritual journey. Recalling experiences of feeding baby lions and swimming with great white sharks, Kesha said, \"I got hypnotized, and I just really wanted this record to be really positive, really raw, really vulnerable and about the magic of life.\" She intends for the song to show her vulnerable side, saying, \"I have a lot of growing and evolving to do. I'm definitely not a one-trick pony and I think people are starting to see that more and more.\"\nAbout the song, she told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio:\n\"It's kind of an anthem. It's a celebration song, which I\u2019m obviously known for writing those, but this one, the concept of it was to live each and every single day like it's your last and to always remain having a youthful spirit no matter how old I get...I can sing like a motherf***er! You're going to hear that because I'm also doing this acoustic EP for my fans. Some of the old songs and the new songs.\"\nThe song employs Kesha's trademark electropop sounds. \"Die Young\" spreads acoustic guitar strums, in the progression of C#m-B-E-A, over an uptempo dance beat, while Kesha belts her half-rapped, half-sung vocals on the verses, where she says, \"I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums.\" Over throbbing percussion, she continues: \"Oh what a shame that you came here with someone / So while you're here in my arms / Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young.\" \"Die Young\" features synth riffs in the new wave style, reminiscent of The Cars and other music in the 1980s. Towards the end of the song, a choir of backing vocals chimes the chorus over a glam rock drum beat.\nSeventeen called it \"classic Ke$ha\", while Robbie Daw of Idolator said, \"[I'm] getting a 'if you\u2019ve heard one Ke$ha song, you\u2019ve heard 'em all' vibe, which is unfortunate.\" In an interview with Rolling Stone, she said she intended to craft songs in the 1970s \"cock rock\" genre, but Daw felt that her lackluster vocal delivery neither departed from her previous sound nor lived up to the hype. Rolling Stone said that \"Die Young\" is \"the Ke$ha we know and love,\" and that \"it sounds sorta exactly like Taio Cruz\". August Brown of the Los Angeles Times agreed, saying the single was, \"...no major departure from her classic template of ravey pop spiced with gum-smacking raps and occasional vocal acrobatics.\" Further, she wrote that \"Die Young\" had a \"stock-and-trade\" message, with the title being, \"...a fate... less like a thing to be avoided, and more like the goal is to live fast and leave a good-looking corpse.\" Marc Hogan of Spin wrote that Kesha's usual idiosyncrasies of punk rockers downing shots, transparent in even her worst songs, did not appear on \"Die Young\", announcing that \"this one feels a bit more, well, blah than her previous hits.\""

It appeared  on the 1991 Rush film soundtrack. In January 1992, Clapton performed the song in front of an audience at Bray Studios, Berkshire, England for MTV Unplugged, with the recording appearing on his Unplugged album.\nThe song was Clapton's best-selling single in the United States and reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. In his home country the United Kingdom it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart, and also charted in the top 10 in more than twenty nations around the world. It won three Grammy Awards for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked \"Tears in Heaven\" 362nd on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\nIn August 1990, Clapton's manager, two of his roadies and his friend and fellow musician Stevie Ray Vaughan were killed in a helicopter accident. On 20 March 1991, Clapton's 4-year-old son Conor died after falling from the 53rd-floor window of a New York City apartment belonging to Conor's mother's friend.\nAfter isolating himself for a period, Clapton began working again, writing music for the film Rush (1991). He dealt with the grief of his son's death by cowriting \"Tears in Heaven\" for the soundtrack with Will Jennings. In an interview in 1992, Clapton said of the song, \"It was in the back of my head but it didn't really have a reason for being until I was scoring this movie ... then it sort of had a reason to be. And it is a little ambiguous because it could be taken to be about Conor but it also is meant to be part of the film.\"\n\nIn an interview with Daphne Barak, Clapton said: \"I almost subconsciously used music for myself as a healing agent, and lo and behold, it worked... I have got a great deal of happiness and a great deal of healing from music.\" Jennings said:\n[Clapton] said to me, \"I want to write a song about my boy.\" Eric had the first verse of the song written, which, to me, is all the song, but he wanted me to write the rest of the verse lines and the release (\"Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees...\"), even though I told him that it was so personal he should write everything himself. He told me that he had admired the work I did with Steve Winwood and finally there was nothing else but to do as he requested, despite the sensitivity of the subject. This is a song so personal and so sad that it is unique in my experience of writing songs.\nShortly after the single was released, Clapton recorded the song in front of an audience at Bray Studios, Berkshire, England as part of a set for MTV Unplugged, released as Unplugged. The album topped numerous charts, including the US, Japan and Australia, reached number two in the UK, and was nominated for nine Grammy Awards the year it was released.\n\"Tears in Heaven\" is Clapton's best-selling single in the United States. With more than 2,800,000 copies sold \u2013 both physical and digital \u2013 it remains one of the best-selling pop singles of the 1990s and one of the best-selling singles released by any non-American artist. The Reprise Records single reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts, where it charted for 26 weeks. It was kept from the number one spot by \"Save the Best for Last\" by Vanessa Williams. It is also Clapton's highest-charting single on the Hot 100 after \"I Shot the Sheriff\", which is Clapton's only Hot 100 number one single to date. While charting on Americas most important single chart, Clapton received several sales awards by the Billboard magazine, including a \"Hot Shot Debut\" and a \"Power Pick/Sales\" certificate. After the physical single release was certified with a Gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 18, 1992, the single was still selling about 150,000 copies every week. On April 15, 1992, \"Tears in Heaven\" was certified with a Platinum certification award for sales of more than 1,000,000 copies in the United States. It topped the Top Single Sales chart, compiled by the Billboard magazine in 1992. The release also topped Billboard magazines Adult Contemporary chart, on which \"Tears in Heaven\" charted for a total of 30 weeks, and also became a number one single on the Top 100 Cashbox charts. By the end of 1992, \"Tears in Heaven\" sold more than 2,300,000 copies in the United States alone. The pop single also received a lot of airplay,"

It was written by Fergie and Toby Gad while the production was helmed by will.i.am. The song was released as the fourth single from the album on May 22, 2007. \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" deviates from the hip hop and urban music of Fergie's previous singles and opts for a more simplistic pop ballad sound that incorporates acoustic elements. It features credits from about thirty instrumentalists, many of which play the violins, violas and celli on the track. Lyrically, the song talks about moving on from the pain of a breakup.\nThe critical reception of \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" was positive, with many praising the maturity and simplicity displayed on the single as well as the message. The song was a commercial success domestically, attaining the top position on the Billboard Hot 100. It became her third single to do so and earned her the accolade of being the first female artist with three number-one singles from one album since Christina Aguilera in 2000. \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" also became Fergie's longest-charting and highest-selling single in the US with 3,833,000 units sold as of August 2012. The song also reached number one in eleven international territories including Australia, where it spent nine weeks at the top position, became the highest-selling song of 2007, and was certified quintuple platinum.\nThe accompanying music video for the song was directed by Anthony Mandler and released in May 2007. It depicts Fergie and her love interest, portrayed by actor Milo Ventimiglia, in their turbulent relationship that ultimately ends with Fergie packing up her belongings and driving away in her car. The music video featured Fergie in apparel designed by Candie's and was used by the brand to promote their clothing line.\n\"Big Girls Don't Cry\" was written by Fergie (credited as Stacy Ferguson) and Toby Gad. The song was recorded at the Metropolis Recording Studio in London, England. will.i.am produced the song as well as playing the bass, supervising in programming the drums and engineering the song. In discussing the album with Clover Hope of Billboard, Adams described the production of this song to be his most challenging yet, saying that \"I did an Edie Brickell type of production.\" He was aided by Neil Tucker and Tal Herzberg, who also provided additional editing with the use of Pro Tools technology. The song features a large number of instrumentalists on the song. On the basses are Trey Henry and Mike Valerio while Keith Harris plays the drums, keyboard bass and keys. George Pajon Jr. plays the guitar. \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" features eighteen violinists, four people on the violas and four people on the celli. The strings were arranged and conducted by Ron Fair, who also produced the additional vocals on the song. They were recorded by Allen Sides at the Signet Sound. The song was mixed at Ocean Way Recordings in Hollywood, California, by Jack Joseph Puig and Dean Nelson. A&M Records, in association with will.i.am Music Group and Interscope Records, sent the song to contemporary hit radio on May 20, 2007, in the United States.\n\"Big Girls Don't Cry\" has a length of 4 minutes and 28 seconds. It incorporates elements from different genres such as acoustic folk and is composed by simple drums, synthesizers, violins, strings, viola, and celli. The song is written in the key of G major and is set in time signature of common time with a moderate pop tempo of 113 beats per minute. Fergie's vocal range spans from the high-tone of C\u2085 to the lower register of G\u2083. The song has a basic sequence of G\u2013Csus2\u2013D5 as its chord progression. The song is a ballad about the end of a relationship and dealing with personal issues.\n\"Big Girls Don't Cry\" received general acclaim. Spence D. of IGN writes that the album's aura diminishes as \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" plays and comments \"Listening to this song it begins to dawn on you that by this juncture the album has strategically delivered a song tailor made for each of the varying commercial radio formats.\" Mike Joseph of PopMatters praised the song for permitting her vocal ability to shine. Bill Lamb of About.com rated the song four out of five stars, praising the mood, lyrics and vocals as \"mellow, still sexy\", \"intelligent\" and \"strong\". He noted however that there could be a moment in the song where it all catches fire. Lamb further added that the simple, gentle back lets the track"

It was released on August 6, 1990 as the lead single from his album No Fences. The song spent four weeks at number one on the Hot Country Songs, and won both the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association awards for 1990 Single of the Year.\n\"Friends in Low Places\" was written in 1989 by songwriters Earl Bud Lee and Dewayne Blackwell. The two songwriters had given the song to Brooks to record as a demo soon before the release of his self-titled first album, when he was a relatively unknown singer. Enamored with the song, Brooks recorded the official version the next year. Mark Chesnutt recorded the song for his second album Too Cold at Home.\nAccording to Earl Bud Lee, one of the song's co-writers, the idea of the song was born when he and some songwriting friends gathered for lunch one day at Tavern on the Row, a popular Nashville eatery. When the check came, Lee realized he had forgotten his money. He was asked how he was going to pay for the meal, and he replied, \"Don't worry. I have friends in low places. I know the cook.\" Lee and his songwriting partner, Dewayne Blackwell, immediately recognized that the line \"friends in low places\" had potential, but they didn't act upon it immediately.\nSome months later, Lee and Blackwell were at a party, celebrating a recent No. 1 hit by another songwriter. They began to talk about the dormant \"friends in low places\" idea, and \"at that very moment, it all started to come together in a song,\" Lee said. Because nothing else was available, they wrote the song on paper napkins. When the songwriters polished \"Friends in Low Places\", they contacted Garth Brooks to see if he would record a demo for them.\nGuitarist James Garver would add the name of the bar in the song, \"The Oasis\", after an establishment in his hometown of Concordia, Kansas.\n\"Friends in Low Places\" is in a moderate tempo and the key of A major. The song begins with arpeggios on the chords A, B\u266ddim7, B\u20987, and Eadd9, a pattern which is repeated throughout the verses. The intro was not originally part of the song, but was improvised by session guitarist Mark Casstevens. The chorus uses A-B\u2098-E twice before ending on an A chord. An electric guitar solo with pedal steel guitar flourishes is played between the first chorus and second verse.\n\"Friends in Low Places\" requires an unusually wide vocal range spanning over two octaves to be sung properly. The song spans from a low note of E\u2082 to a high of F\u266f\u2084.\nLee and Blackwell had met Brooks when he was a shoe salesman in a Nashville store, looking for his big break. The two struck up a conversation with the struggling musician, and upon learning his background, they gave him some work making demos of their songs. They were impressed with his voice and talent, but there wasn't much else they could do for him.\nWhen Blackwell contacted Brooks to make the \"Friends in Low Places\" demo, Brooks explained to Blackwell that he was newly signed to Capitol Records, and that his first single and first album were already scheduled.\nThe demo of \"Friends in Low Places\" was recorded at Windwalker Studios, in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. Musicians on the demo were John Beland (of The Flying Burrito Brothers) on acoustic and electric guitars, along with session aces Steve Turner on drums, and bassist Larry Paxton. Frank Green was the recording engineer. The actual master recording of \"Friends in Low Places\" borrowed quite a lot from the original demo, copying Beland's now famous acoustic guitar intro.\nAfter recording the demo (the last he would ever make), Brooks thanked Lee and Blackwell for all of their help. He then expressed his liking for the song, wishing aloud that he had heard it several weeks earlier, when he was recording his new album.\nBrooks provided the following background information on the song in the CD booklet liner notes from The Hits:\n\"\"Friends in Low Places\" was the last demo session I ever did as a singer. The demo was for Bud Lee and Dewayne Blackwell. I sang the session out in Hendersonville, and for the next two weeks the chorus to this song kept running through my head. I knew it would be a year and a half before the release of No Fences because Garth Brooks was just getting ready to be released. I asked Bud Lee and Dewayne if I could hold on to it and, without a blink of an eye, they both said yes. Putting that kind of faith into an"

It was written by Lewis in collaboration with Richard \"Biff\" Stannard, Iain James, Jez Ashurst and Bradford Ellis, and produced by Richard \"Biff\" Stannard. It was released in the United States on 5 November, in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 29 November and many parts of Europe on 2 December. \"One More Sleep\" is recognised as one of the biggest recent Christmas songs in the UK according to the Official Charts Company. Furthermore, the song is certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. \"One More Sleep\" is also one of the most-streamed Christmas songs in the UK, with over 65 million streams.\nIn February 2013, a representative from Syco Music, Lewis' record label, announced that she was about to start writing and recording material \"imminently\" for her fourth studio album, and that it would be released in late 2013. The news came after Lewis announced that she had parted ways from Modest! Management, the management team who had represented her since she won the third series of The X Factor in 2006. Various media outlets speculated that this was due to the weak commercial performance of her third studio album, Glassheart, which was released in November 2012. It became her first album to not debut at number one or earn platinum certification in the United Kingdom. It was also reported that the second single from the album, \"Lovebird\", had sold fewer than 600\u00a0copies, meaning it failed to attain one of 200\u00a0chart positions on the UK Singles Chart, was another contributing factor to her departure.\nIn June 2013, speculation arose that Lewis' fourth album would in fact be a Christmas album, after British production duo MagicIT tweeted that they were in a studio recording Christmas songs with the singer. The following month, Lewis confirmed that she was indeed in the process of recording a Christmas album. She revealed that it was recorded on the recommendation of Syco boss Simon Cowell. Speaking about the decision to record a Christmas album at this point in her career in July 2013, further explained how Cowell had come up with the idea: \"Simon is still very much involved in my career and helps me out. He came up with the Christmas album idea, and we both kind of felt it was the right time to go ahead with it.\"\nOn 24 October 2013, Lewis unveiled \"One More Sleep\" as the album's lead single, and she released the single cover artwork a week later on 31 October. The artwork is a head shot of Lewis holding a red bow over her eye. The song was released as a digital download in the United States on 5 November through RCA Records, Ireland, Italy and Switzerland through Sony Music Entertainment and the United Kingdom through Syco Music on 29 November, and multiple other European countries on 2 December, including France and Spain. Lewis uploaded a Cahill remix of the song to her official SoundCloud account on 21 November 2013.\n\"One More Sleep\" was co-written by Lewis in collaboration with Richard \"Biff\" Stannard, Iain James, Jez Ashurst and Bradford Ellis. Stannard and Ash Howes produced the song, while they and Lewis carried out the vocal production. It was recorded by Biffco and mixed by Howes at Biffco Studios, Brighton, and Angel Recording Studios, London. The song utilised a multitude of instrumentalists: Keys and programming were performed by Ashurst, Stannard and Howes; Celli by Nick Holland; drums by Freddy Sheed and bass by Knight Time Horns; trombone by Barnaby Dickinson and trumpet by Graeme Flowers; James Knight performed the saxophone; strings were led by Rolf Wilson, arranged and conducted by Cliff Masterson and booked by Roz Colls; Rolf Wilson, Simon Baggs, Steve Morris, Julian Leaper, Tom Piggot Smith, Richard George, Jonathan Hill, Laura Bruce White, Tim Grant, Reiad Chibah performed the violins; and violas by Greg Walmsley, Nerys Richards. Background vocals were sung by Katie Holmes, Kelli-Leigh Henry-Davila and Bianca Claxton, while Choir vocals were performed by Diva singers, who were arranged and conducted by Masterson.\n\"One More Sleep\" is a Motown inspired song which lasts for a duration of 3:59. The hook consists of a Christmas countdown, whereby Lewis sings \"Cause I got five more nights of sleeping on my own/ Four more days until you\u2019re coming home/ Three more"

It was released on May 25, 2018, to radio stations through Atlantic Records as the fourth single from her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy (2018). \"I Like It\" is a Latin trap song that comprises a trap drum beat and salsa music. It was written by the three performers along with Jordan Thorpe and Klenord Raphael, while the production was handled by J. White Did It, Tainy, Craig Kallman and Invincible. The song contains a sample from \"I Like It Like That\", replayed by musicians during production, with Tony Pab\u00f3n, Manny Rodriguez, and Benny Bonnilla being credited as co-writers.\nWork on the song took from October 2017 to early April 2018. Its music video was filmed in Little Havana, Miami and has received more than 1.3 billion views. The single topped the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Cardi B's second number one\u2014the first time a female rapper achieved this in the chart's history, and the first for both Bad Bunny and J Balvin. It also reached the top 10 in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Critically acclaimed, Billboard staff, Los Angeles Times, and Apple Music's editorial selection ranked it as the best song of the year, while Rolling Stone named it \"the best summer song of all time.\"\n\"I Like It\" was nominated for Record of the Year at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. It became the first song led by a female rapper to surpass a billion streams on Spotify, also making Cardi B the first woman in hip hop with a pair of billion-streamers on the service, joining her collaboration \"Girls Like You\". \"I Like It\" is the highest-ranked song led by a female rapper on the Billboard Hot 100 decade-end chart for the 2010s. It was certified nine times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2020, becoming the second-highest-certified single by a female rapper, following the Diamond-certified \"Bodak Yellow\". As of 2021, it is the most-streamed song by a female rapper in the UK.\nDuring the recording sessions of Invasion of Privacy, Cardi and her team were listening to beats and song ideas. Craig Kallman wanted to include a track that pays homage to her Latin heritage and searched among his Latin music collection of records that he used to play when he was a DJ. Decided for Pete Rodriguez's \"I Like It Like That\" and \"Oh That's Nice\", he added J. White to the production process. The sample of the former song \"over a very rough instrumental\" and with a Cardi verse on it was sent to musician Edgar Machuca. White and Machuca worked on the production, chopping up the sample and trying to \"make the song sound better and cohesive and beef up the production.\" Cardi re-wrote the hook a number of times and cut vocals, eventually choosing the chorus she was most comfortable with. The three producers looped the \"I Like It\" part as they felt that was the catchiest part of the sample. Machuca proposed to add Bad Bunny and J Balvin to the track, with both artists contributing with their verses and ideas. Tainy and Invicible finished working on the production focusing on the instrumentals. Work on the record started in October 2017, and finished in early April 2018.\n\"I Like It\" is a Latin trap song. It is a blend of trap and salsa, and interpolates 1967 boogaloo song \"I Like It Like That\". By replaying the sample instead of using the physical sample, its owners receive compensation and credit for their composition, with production saving money and retaining publishing ownership. As noted by a Billboard editor, the song is \"heavily indebted to the world of Latin hip hop.\" Bad Bunny raps in English and Spanish, while J Balvin performs in Spanish.\n\"I Like It\" received critical acclaim. Writing for Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos deemed it \"the song of the summer\" and commented \"[it] sounds like it was chemically concocted in a mad scientist's lab to be 2018's reigning song of the summer. [...] Everything about this song is perfect for summer: the trap-meets-salsa beat, features from two of reggaeton's biggest stars, a sample of Pete Rodriguez's"

Recorded late into the production of Rowland's second solo album Ms. Kelly (2007), the song was released on March 13, 2007 as the lead single from the album. The artists co-wrote the song with its producers Sean Garrett, Polow da Don, Blac Elvis, and Jason Perry, with additional production from S-Dot. \"Like This\" is a R&B song, with its lyrics referring to a woman growing out of a past relationship.\nThe song received generally positive critical reviews. Upon its release, the song became Rowland's highest-charting solo success since her 2002 single \"Stole\", reaching the top-ten in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as  the top-twenty in Australia and New Zealand and number 30 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. In addition, it became Rowland's first single to peak at the top position on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. An accompanying music video was directed by Mike Ruiz and filmed in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, California in mid-March 2007.\n\"Like This\" was written by Sean Garrett, Polow da Don, Blac Elvis, Jason Perry, Rowland, and rapper Eve Jeffers. The song was one of the last songs on the Ms. Kelly album that Rowland and Garrett started working on in mid-September 2006 after the cancellation of My Story, the album's actual version. Conceived around an instrumental track from da Don, Rowland declared \"Like This\" the perfect example of what attitude she exactly had on her mind when creating the revamped version the album, telling MTV News in 2007: \"Polow already had this hot track. I loved the sound of the cowbell; it was so different! Sean and I started writing and he said 'Kelly this is your first single'.\" Happy about finally running \"into that song that definitely sticks out\" after many months recording, Rowland eventually took a break from recording.\nInitially titled \"Wooo!\" and \"Bump like This\", Rowland resumed recording weeks later after she had approached Eve to appear on the song. \"I just heard Eve on this song\", she recalled. \"I knew her energy belonged on the song and, just like that, it all came together. Then I knew: This was the single [...] and it turned out he [Sean] was right.\" Garrett further elaoborated in an interview with MTV: \"It's a great combination of her thoughts and her feel on the type of music that she likes to do. It's a cross between something in a club and on mainstream radio. We're just trying to stay a step ahead of what's going on.\" Next to Polow da Don, Garrett, S-Dot, and Elvis received co-producer credits on \"Like This\". Vocal production was helmed by Rowland and Max Gousse, while mixing was handled Jean Marie Horvat with Colin Miller serving as assistant.\n\"Like This\" received generally positive review from contemporary music critics. Spence D. of media website IGN observed that \"Rowland's playfully serious stance is exposed on the jump off track, which surges to a Polow the Don groove that is slinky and invigorating. Toss in a little cameo from Eve and you've got one of those sizzling summertime mid-tempo jammies that'll appeal to even the most sullen of R&B pop fans.\" BBC critic Gemma Padley wrote that the song \"works an hypnotic riff not a million miles away from Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot\u201d Billboard felt that \"compared with her gospel-fueled 2002 solo debut Simply Deep, Rowland appears confident and dominant on foot-stompers like [...] the Eve-assisted single.\" Metro's Shereen Low declared it a \"stomping tune,\" while Sal Cinquemani from Slant called the song \"hot and fresh\" and ranked it 33rd on Slant's Best Albums & Singles of 2007 listing.\nMichael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly found that \"it\u2019s gota bouncy enough beat, and a 'ladies leave your man at home' vibe that\u2019s reminiscent of Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s \u201cJumpin', Jumpin'\u201d but aside from the bridge, the vocal could\u2019ve been handled by prettymuch any female singer on the charts today [...] And shouldn\u2019t a singer of Kelly\u2019s caliber deliver something a little more distinctive for a lead single?\" Guardian journalist Rosie Swash found that \"whilst \"Like This\" is hardly Rowland's Sistine Chapel, the 26-year-old's new track does have something to it [...] The rumbling drums, the sparse keyboard chords, the Lil' Kim-esque \"I told y'all I was gonna bump like this!\", well, damned if Rowland isn't having the time of her life.\" In his review for Splice Today, Noah Berlatsky called the song \"surprisingly"

It was released as a non-album single in July 1971, to raise awareness for the millions of refugees from the country formerly known as East Pakistan, following the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the outbreak of the Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison's inspiration for the song came from his friend Ravi Shankar, a Indian-Bengali musician, who approached Harrison for help in trying to alleviate the suffering. \"Bangla Desh\" has been described as \"one of the most cogent social statements in music history\" and helped gain international support for Bangladeshi independence by establishing the name of the fledgling nation around the world. In 2005, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan identified the song's success in personalising the Bangladesh crisis, through its emotive description of Shankar's request for help.\n\"Bangla Desh\" appeared at the height of Harrison's popularity as a solo artist, following the break-up of the Beatles and the acclaim afforded his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass. It was pop music's first charity single, and its release took place three days before the Harrison-sponsored Concert for Bangladesh shows at New York's Madison Square Garden. The single became a top ten hit in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe, and peaked at number 23 on America's Billboard Hot 100. The recording was co-produced by Phil Spector and features contributions from Leon Russell, Jim Horn, Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner. The Los Angeles session for the song marked the start of two enduring musical associations in Harrison's solo career, with Keltner and Horn.\nBacked by these musicians and others including Eric Clapton and Billy Preston, Harrison performed \"Bangla Desh\" at the UNICEF concerts, on 1 August 1971, as a rousing encore. In a review of the Concert for Bangladesh live album for Rolling Stone magazine, Jon Landau identified this reading as \"the concert's single greatest performance by all concerned\". The studio recording appeared on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison, which remained its only official CD release until September 2014, when it was included as a bonus track on the Apple Years 1968\u201375 reissue of Harrison's Living in the Material World album. Artists who have covered the song include Stu Phillips & the Hollyridge Strings and Italian saxophonist Fausto Papetti.\nBy the spring of 1971, George Harrison had established himself as the most successful ex-Beatle during the former band members' first year as solo artists; in the words of biographer Elliot Huntley, he \"couldn't have got any more popular in the eyes of the public\". Just as importantly, writes Peter Lavezzoli, author of The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Harrison had \"amassed such good will in the music community\" during that time. Rather than looking to immediately follow up his All Things Must Pass triple album, he had spent the months since recording ended in October 1970 repaying favours to the friends and musicians who had helped make the album such a success. These included co-producer Phil Spector, whose wife, Ronnie Spector, Harrison supplied with songs for a proposed solo album on Apple Records; Ringo Starr, whose \"It Don't Come Easy\" single he produced and prepared for release, following the original session for the song in March 1970; Bobby Whitlock, singer and keyboard player with the short-lived Derek and the Dominos, whose eponymous debut solo album featured Harrison and Eric Clapton on guitar; and former Spooky Tooth pianist Gary Wright, whose Footprint album (1971) Harrison also guested on, along with All Things Must Pass orchestrator John Barham.\nAnother project was a documentary on the life and music of Ravi Shankar, Howard Worth's Raga (1971), for which Harrison had stepped in at the last minute to provide funding and distribution through Apple Films. With Harrison also serving as record producer for the accompanying soundtrack album, work began with Shankar in Los Angeles during April 1971 and resumed in late June, following Harrison-produced sessions in London for the band Badfinger.\nA Bengali by birth, Shankar had already brought the growing humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh to Harrison's attention, while staying at the ex-Beatle's house, Friar Park, earlier in the year. The state formerly known as East Pakistan (and before that, East Bengal) had suffered an estimated 300,000 casualties when the Bhola cyclone hit its shores on 12 November 1970, and the"

Harrison was inspired to write the song following the successful Concert for Bangladesh shows, which were held in New York on 1 August 1971 as a benefit for refugees from the country formerly known as East Pakistan. The lyrics reflect his disappointment that such a humanitarian aid project was necessary, given the abundance of resources available across the planet, and his belief that if all individuals were more spiritually aware, there would be no suffering in the world. Adding to Harrison's frustration while writing the song, the aid project became embroiled in financial problems, as commercial concerns delayed the release of the Concert for Bangladesh album, and government tax departments failed to embrace the goodwill inherent in the venture.\nHarrison recorded \"The Day the World Gets 'Round\" in England between October 1972 and March 1973. The recording features an orchestral arrangement by John Barham and a similarly well-regarded vocal performance from Harrison. The other contributing musicians were Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner. Reviewers have described the composition variously as a protest song, a devotional prayer, and a counterpart to John Lennon's peace anthem \"Imagine\".\nAs with all the new songs released on Living in the Material World, Harrison donated his publishing royalties from the track to the Material World Charitable Foundation, an organisation he set up to avoid the tax problems that had befallen his Bangladesh relief effort. The song typifies Harrison's ideal for a world unencumbered by national, religious or cultural delineation. In 2009, Voormann and Yusuf Islam covered \"The Day the World Gets 'Round\" and released it as a single to benefit children in war-torn Gaza.\nIn his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison describes the period following the two Concert for Bangladesh shows as \"very emotional\". The concerts took place at Madison Square Garden, New York, on 1 August 1971, as the first part of his fundraising program for the 8\u201310 million refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. The generosity of all the participants, together with the response from the general public, encouraged Harrison to feel \"very positive about certain things\". At the same time, the fact that it had fallen to musicians such as himself and concert instigator Ravi Shankar to address the issue left Harrison \"slightly enraged\", given the wealth of resources available to governments around the globe. Author Gary Tillery writes that, through his humanitarian gesture, Harrison had \"changed the perception\" of rock musicians, \"making it clear they could be good world citizens too\", while music critic Mikal Gilmore has noted of Harrison's \"cautious yet optimistic and tender\" worldview: \"[it] stood in stark contrast to the ugly dissolution of the Beatles and the defeated idealism that then characterised so much of rock & roll culture.\" The day after the Madison Square Garden concerts, Harrison began writing the song \"The Day the World Gets 'Round\", having stayed in New York to work with producer Phil Spector on the proposed live album of the event.\nHarrison found frustration in this next phase of the Bangladesh project, as the various record companies associated with the concerts' performers attempted to profit from the forthcoming release. Chief among these was the Beatles' US distributor, Capitol Records, who delayed issuing the album in the hope of negotiating a royalty rate to cover what they perceived as high distribution costs for the boxed three-record set. Harrison was resolute that Capitol should absorb the costs, just as the Beatles' Apple record label had already paid for the album's lavish packaging and full-colour booklet. All those involved with the concerts and post-production on the live album had given their services for free, in keeping with Harrison's hope that, in Tillery's words: \"Every penny of income \u2013 from the gate receipts to the profits from an album and a film \u2013 would go toward alleviating the suffering.\"\nBy early October 1971, bootleg recordings of the concerts were available in New York, potentially denying funds to the refugees. On 23 November, Harrison's exasperation with the situation saw him raging against Capitol president Bhaskar Menon during a late-night television interview with Dick Cavett, and threatening to take the album to a rival label.

It was scheduled to be issued as a single in September that year, as the follow-up to \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\", but the release was cancelled. Music critics have traditionally viewed \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" as a highlight of the Material World album, praising its pop qualities and production, with some considering the song worthy of hit status.\nHarrison wrote and recorded \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" during a period marked by his heightened devotion to Hindu spirituality, which coincided with marital problems with his first wife, Pattie Boyd, and the financial complications affecting his Bangladesh aid project. The track is an upbeat love song in the tradition of early 1960s Brill Building songwriters. Its lyrics have invited debate among commentators as to whether Harrison is addressing a lover such as Boyd or, like the majority of his lyrics on Material World, God.\nAlthough produced by Harrison alone, the recording employs aspects of the Wall of Sound production synonymous with his former collaborator Phil Spector \u2013 through the use of reverb, two drummers and multiple acoustic rhythm guitar parts. The musicians accompanying Harrison on the track are Gary Wright, Nicky Hopkins, Ringo Starr, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. In November 1976, during the filming of their joint appearance on Saturday Night Live, Harrison performed \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" with singer Paul Simon, but the song did not appear in the broadcast.\nAs with all the new songs on his 1973 album Living in the Material World, George Harrison wrote \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" in 1971\u201372, a period of heightened devotion to Hindu spirituality on his part. \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" is a love song, and in light of problems in Harrison's marriage to Pattie Boyd at the time, Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley remarks: \"it's interesting to speculate as to who it was written about\u00a0...\" Author Jeff Walker suggests that the song's apparently non-devotional subject matter may have resulted from Harrison and Boyd's marital difficulties.\nAgainst Harrison's wishes, Boyd had resumed her modelling career in May 1971, having long felt isolated by her husband's association with the Hare Krishna movement. His Concert for Bangladesh aid project had then united the couple, according to their friend Chris O'Dell, who recalls Harrison as \"attentive and affectionate\" towards Boyd while planning the concerts that summer. The project's subsequent business and legal issues became a source of frustration for Harrison, as he spent much of 1972 negotiating with government departments for the release of the funds raised for the refugees. In February 1972, Harrison and Boyd were injured in an automobile accident in England, after which, author Alan Clayson writes, \"her recovery was impaired by George's pounding on a drum-kit that he'd set up in the next room.\"\nIn August that year, Harrison set off for a driving holiday around Europe without Boyd, a trip that Huntley describes as \"the first publicly visible signs\" of problems in the Harrisons' marriage. While in Portugal, Harrison stayed with his musician friend Gary Wright, who, Huntley suggests, \"play[ed] the diplomat\" by telling the press: \"He's writing lots of new things and he seems to be having a good time\u00a0... Sometimes he takes Pattie with him, but I feel he just felt like a holiday and wanted to get away.\"\nIn his book The Words and Music of George Harrison, Ian Inglis writes that \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" incorporates many of the elements of pop composition pioneered during the early 1960s at New York's Brill Building, where songwriters such as Barry Mann, Carole King and Gerry Goffin began their careers. Inglis lists these \"stock motifs\" as \"a repetitive and attractive melody\", \"a stereotypical choice of language\", \"the familiar topic of lost, or unrequited, love\" and \"the conventional form of address from a man to a woman, in the persistent use of 'baby'\". These elements appear in the song's chorus, where Harrison sings: \"How I love you / Baby, so don't let me wait too long.\"\nHarrison biographer Simon Leng views \"pop-soul music\" as \"the obvious root\" of \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" and cites musical tension as one facet of the pop-soul style that Harrison adopts. This tension is evident in the \"implie[d] dissonance\" during the verses, Leng adds, when Harrison moves from an F major chord to D-flat major. In reference to a lyric in the verses, Clayson suggests: \"Although 'Don't Let Me Wait Too Long' betrayed that George's sublimation of lust"

Harrison was inspired to write the song following the successful Concert for Bangladesh shows, which were held in New York on 1 August 1971 as a benefit for refugees from the country formerly known as East Pakistan. The lyrics reflect his disappointment that such a humanitarian aid project was necessary, given the abundance of resources available across the planet, and his belief that if all individuals were more spiritually aware, there would be no suffering in the world. Adding to Harrison's frustration while writing the song, the aid project became embroiled in financial problems, as commercial concerns delayed the release of the Concert for Bangladesh album, and government tax departments failed to embrace the goodwill inherent in the venture.\nHarrison recorded \"The Day the World Gets 'Round\" in England between October 1972 and March 1973. The recording features an orchestral arrangement by John Barham and a similarly well-regarded vocal performance from Harrison. The other contributing musicians were Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner. Reviewers have described the composition variously as a protest song, a devotional prayer, and a counterpart to John Lennon's peace anthem \"Imagine\".\nAs with all the new songs released on Living in the Material World, Harrison donated his publishing royalties from the track to the Material World Charitable Foundation, an organisation he set up to avoid the tax problems that had befallen his Bangladesh relief effort. The song typifies Harrison's ideal for a world unencumbered by national, religious or cultural delineation. In 2009, Voormann and Yusuf Islam covered \"The Day the World Gets 'Round\" and released it as a single to benefit children in war-torn Gaza.\nIn his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison describes the period following the two Concert for Bangladesh shows as \"very emotional\". The concerts took place at Madison Square Garden, New York, on 1 August 1971, as the first part of his fundraising program for the 8\u201310 million refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. The generosity of all the participants, together with the response from the general public, encouraged Harrison to feel \"very positive about certain things\". At the same time, the fact that it had fallen to musicians such as himself and concert instigator Ravi Shankar to address the issue left Harrison \"slightly enraged\", given the wealth of resources available to governments around the globe. Author Gary Tillery writes that, through his humanitarian gesture, Harrison had \"changed the perception\" of rock musicians, \"making it clear they could be good world citizens too\", while music critic Mikal Gilmore has noted of Harrison's \"cautious yet optimistic and tender\" worldview: \"[it] stood in stark contrast to the ugly dissolution of the Beatles and the defeated idealism that then characterised so much of rock & roll culture.\" The day after the Madison Square Garden concerts, Harrison began writing the song \"The Day the World Gets 'Round\", having stayed in New York to work with producer Phil Spector on the proposed live album of the event.\nHarrison found frustration in this next phase of the Bangladesh project, as the various record companies associated with the concerts' performers attempted to profit from the forthcoming release. Chief among these was the Beatles' US distributor, Capitol Records, who delayed issuing the album in the hope of negotiating a royalty rate to cover what they perceived as high distribution costs for the boxed three-record set. Harrison was resolute that Capitol should absorb the costs, just as the Beatles' Apple record label had already paid for the album's lavish packaging and full-colour booklet. All those involved with the concerts and post-production on the live album had given their services for free, in keeping with Harrison's hope that, in Tillery's words: \"Every penny of income \u2013 from the gate receipts to the profits from an album and a film \u2013 would go toward alleviating the suffering.\"\nBy early October 1971, bootleg recordings of the concerts were available in New York, potentially denying funds to the refugees. On 23 November, Harrison's exasperation with the situation saw him raging against Capitol president Bhaskar Menon during a late-night television interview with Dick Cavett, and threatening to take the album to a rival label.

The recording features a sparse musical arrangement and recalls Harrison's work with the Beatles during 1966\u20131968, through its Indian-inspired mood and use of sitar drone. Part of Harrison's inspiration for the song was the popular 1971 book Be Here Now by spiritual teacher Ram Dass \u2013 specifically, a story discussing the author's change in identity from a Western academic to a guru in the Hindu faith. Some Harrison biographers interpret \"Be Here Now\" as a comment from him on the public's nostalgia for the past following the Beatles' break-up.\nHarrison wrote the song in Los Angeles in 1971, while working on the soundtrack to the Ravi Shankar documentary Raga, and shortly before organising the Concert for Bangladesh. The recording took place in late 1972 at his Friar Park home, with musical contributions from Klaus Voormann, Nicky Hopkins, Gary Wright and Jim Keltner. Contrary to the song's message, its release coincided with heightened speculation regarding a possible Beatles reunion, following Harrison, Ringo Starr and John Lennon recording together in Los Angeles in March 1973.\n\"Be Here Now\" has received critical attention for its dreamlike sound and the quality of Harrison's acoustic guitar playing. Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone described the track as a \"meltingly lovely meditation-prayer\", while author Ian Inglis views it as a moving musical expression of \"the spiritual, scientific, and metaphysical implications of time\". Singers Robyn Hitchcock and Ian Astbury have each covered the song.\nIn his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison recalls coming up with the tune for \"Be Here Now\" while staying in Nichols Canyon, Los Angeles, in the spring of 1971. At the time, Harrison was in Los Angeles producing the soundtrack to Raga, an Apple Films documentary about Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar. The same visit led to Harrison staging the Concert for Bangladesh in New York that summer, following a plea from Shankar, a Bengali Hindu, that something be done to raise international awareness for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. In his autobiography, Harrison says of writing the song: \"I was almost falling asleep. I had the guitar in bed and the melody came fast.\" In keeping with this description, the mood and melody of \"Be Here Now\" have a meditative and dreamlike quality.\nThe song is in the musical key of A, with a time signature of 4/4 throughout. According to his handwritten note on the lyrics reproduced in I, Me, Mine, Harrison played the guitar part in open G tuning \u2013 which would typically require the placing of a capo on the guitar's second fret, to attain an open chord of A major. Author and music journalist Paul Trynka writes of \"Be Here Now\" containing \"modal folk riffs\". The composition includes a recurring guitar motif, played over the chords of A major and A major 7, and is structured into two sections of verse separated by a middle eight.\nHarrison drew inspiration for the song's lyrics from \"The Transformation: Dr. Richard Alpert, PhD. into Baba Ram Dass\". A humorous story, \"The Transformation\" was the first of four sections in Ram Dass's book Be Here Now, a popular introductory text to Hindu spirituality. As Richard Alpert, Dass had been a Harvard academic and an associate of Timothy Leary during the early 1960s, before embracing Hinduism \u2013 like Harrison in 1966, via experimentation with hallucinogenic drugs \u2013 and changing his name. Before the book's publication in 1971, according to musicologist Ian MacDonald, the phrase \"Be here now\" had become a \"hippie maxim\", reflecting a fundamental contention of Hindu philosophy regarding the all-importance of the present moment. For Harrison, the present meant his identity outside the public's perception of him as a Beatle, a role he had already tired of in 1965\u201366, during the height of the band's fame.\nAuthor Ian Inglis writes of the parallels between \"Be Here Now\" and one of Harrison's 1968 compositions for the Beatles, \"Long, Long, Long\", due to the two songs' \"common subject matter: time\". In \"Be Here Now\", Harrison delivers his message in simple terms, stating that \"The past was\", whereas \"Now is\". According to theologian Dale Allison, the song also addresses the Hindu concept of maya, whereby the physical world is an illusion and the only truth is to realise the divine nature of one's soul. Harrison warns against what Allison terms \"mistak[ing] the material world, which is only a grand illusion, for the real world\", particularly in the lyrics to the middle eight:\nWhy try to live a life \n That isn't real \n No how? \n A mind that wants"

It was released on September 27, 2004, as the lead single from Snoop Dogg's seventh studio album, R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece (2004). The song was produced by The Neptunes (Pharrell and Chad Hugo). Snoop performs the chorus and the second and third verses, while Pharrell performs the first verse. It is regarded as an iconic song.\nThe song topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks from December 10, 2004, making it Snoop Dogg's first number one on the chart. It was also his fourth top-ten as a solo artist, first since 2003's \"Beautiful\" (1993's \"What's My Name?\" and 1994's \"Gin and Juice\" were the others). The song also gave him his first number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It also peaked at number one for four consecutive weeks in New Zealand, and number ten in the UK Singles Chart. It gained some critical attention for its minimal, extremely sparse production, consisting of tongue clicks, keyboards, a drum machine beat and white noise.  It was nominated at the Grammy Awards of 2005 for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, though it lost both awards to the songs \"Jesus Walks\" and \"Let's Get It Started\", respectively. The single was Pharrell's biggest hit worldwide, until 2013's \"Get Lucky\" and \"Blurred Lines\" (his highest peaking single as lead artist is \"Happy\").\nOn December 10, 2009, \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" was named the most popular rap song of the decade by Billboard.\nThe phrase \"drop it like it's hot\" was already in common use before the song was released, and had been used in various songs since the 1990s. It is a metaphorical description of a dance move commonly performed by women, and is performed by various women throughout the music video. It was used in Positive K's 1992 album The Skills Dat Pay Da Bills, in the song \"Ain't No Crime.\" It was also used by Lil Wayne as a guest rapper on Juvenile's 1999 hit single \"Back That Azz Up\" from his album 400 Degreez, and in his own song called \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" from his 1999 debut album Tha Block is Hot featuring B.G. and Mannie Fresh. Clark Kent said \"drop it like it's hot\" in the song \"Cashmere Thoughts\" from Jay-Z's 1996 debut album, Reasonable Doubt. DJ Quik used the phrase in the song \"Sexuality\" from his album Balance & Options. Another song with the same name is \"Drop It Like It's Hot\", but it is sung by the Big Tymers, and featuring Chilli, Juvenile, and Lac. This version of the song was featured in the Big Tymers' predecessor of their debut, How You Luv That Vol. 2.\nOutside of hip-hop, it was also the title of a song on indie rock band Minus the Bear's 2002 EP Bands Like It When You Yell \"Yar!\" at Them.\nUSA Today called the song \"scorching\". Rolling Stone's Tom Moon said \"The serpentine down-tempo single 'Drop It Like It's Hot', produced by the Neptunes, links Snoop's slyly exuberant delivery to a relentless dance-floor bounce\". Steve \"Flash\" Juon of Rap Reviews wrote: \"the stripped down sound of the Neptunes produced 'Drop it Like It's Hot' has produced one of Snoop's biggest hits to date. Ironically it may be in some ways more gangsterish than his \"Deep Cover\" debut in some aspects, but he's so chill about his delivery it doesn't sound the least bit menacing: That's quintessential Snoop for you - hard when you're not looking, but still velvet enough to appeal to the ladies and drive off in a fly Mercedes\". Similarly, AllMusic's David Jeffries stated: \"the ultrahot production team\u00a0the Neptunes' contribution to the killer single 'Drop It Like It's Hot' had been duly noted, but lost in all the chatter was how inspired and on-fire\u00a0Snoop\u00a0sounds\".\nThe music video of the single was shot in black-and-white. It was directed by Paul Hunter. It shows Snoop Dogg doing the dance step known as the Crip Walk in the very beginning and end. The video included both of Snoop Dogg's sons, Corde and Cordell. Other appearances in the video include Terry Kennedy, Lauren London, Pharrell Williams' fellow Neptunes member Chad Hugo, and Pusha T.\nThe video won the award for the best hip hop video at the 2006 MTV Australia Video Music Awards and a MOBO Award for Best Video in 2005.\nThere are two radio edits for the song: one is a standard radio edit that removes profanities and drug"

Written by Lights in collaboration with songwriter-producer Tawgs Salter, the song was released July 22, 2014 via LIGHTS Music as the lead single from the album. In the United States, it was released to modern rock radio through Warner Bros. Records on September 9, 2014.\nThe song has enjoyed commercial success - it reached number 31 on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 and the top ten on multiple airplay formats, and was certified Gold by Music Canada in January 2015 - and was also met with positive reviews from contemporary music critics, being described as \"impossibly catchy.\"\n\"Up We Go\" is a synthpop song that combines Lights' signature electro-influenced pop production style with \"lush\" guitars. Jeff Benjamin of fuse described the style as a compromise between the lighter synths of her debut and the grittier electropop territory explored on Siberia. Lyrically, the song is an anthem about persevering through difficult times, with the chorus assuring the listener that \"from down this low / It's only up we go\".\nThe song received mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. In his \"Song of the Day\" spotlight featuring \"Up We Go\", Jeff Benjamin of fuse praised Lights for \"[mixing] clever lyrics... with inspiring lyrics about persevering and looking forward to the brighter day\" and was also complimentary of the shift in her sound. Also praising the lighter musical approach, Greg Moskovitch of Music Feeds wrote that \"[t]he punchy, synth-pop production provides a soaring and glittering soundbed for Poxleitner\u2019s motivational lyrics, which lead into an anthemic, impossibly catchy chorus.\" British music blog Popjustice rated the song 8/10 and felt the song had the potential to elevate Lights's career to the next level: \"Canadian electronic pop expert Lights hasn't yet enjoyed the UK success she deserves... which is a shame, because if this excellent first track from her new album 'Little Machines' is anything to go by she's about to scale new heights.\"\n\"Up We Go\" debuted at number 84 on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 for the chart dated August 9, 2014. On the chart dated November 8, 2014, \"Up We Go\" reached a new peak of number 31, becoming her second highest-charting single yet, behind \"Drive My Soul\", which peaked at number 18. It debuted at number 42 on Canada CHR/Top 40 on the chart issued September 13, 2014, as well as number 47 on Canada Hot AC and number 43 on Canada AC the following week. The song has since peaked in the top 10 on the former two, and the top 5 on the latter.\nThe official music video for \"Up We Go\" was directed by Alon Isocianu and premiered on Lights's VEVO channel on September 3, 2014. The one shot video features the singer in an elevator, with various background events and characters appearing as the doors open to new locations.\nThe song \"Up We Go\" also features in the soundtrack and ingame songs of EA's The Sims 4.

In the Slovakian and Slovenian Singles Chart it peaked at seven and two respectively. After a few weeks on the French download charts and music video charts, \"Release Me\" finally entered the Official French Singles Chart at seven in late July. It entered a lot of French charts and became the third most played song on French radio during 2009. The song was also ranked high on a number of airplay charts all over Europe. In 2010 the song was translated to Italian and French by the investment banker/art producer Olivier Doria.\nOn 27 July \"Release Me\" entered the first chart outside of Europe, the Australian Dance Chart at eleven, however on the overall ARIA Charts it peaked at only No. 26. It has also entered the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Chart at 38, and peaked at one.

It was written by group member Winfred Lovett, the bass singer and songwriter of the group, who intoned the song's spoken introduction. The song was recorded for the album The Manhattans, released in 1976 by Columbia Records, and was released as a single in March of the same year. \"Kiss and Say Goodbye\" became a worldwide success, appearing in the musical charts of countless countries, a Top 10 hit in many countries, including No. 1 in the US, Belgium, Netherlands, New Zealand, and in Europe (European Hot 100 Singles). With the exception of Adult Contemporary Chart, \"Kiss and Say Goodbye\" was ranked number 1 in US on all Pop Singles Charts and on all R&B Singles Charts. The song was one of the biggest hits of 1976 and of the 1970s.\nThe song was written by Manhattans bass singer Winfred \"Blue\" Lovett, who also provided the spoken introduction heard in the full-length version of the original recording. The lyrics and melody came to him late one night. As he later recalled, \"Everything was there. I got up about three o'clock in the morning and jotted down the things I wanted to say. I just put the words together on my tape recorder and little piano. I've always thought that when you write slow songs, they have to have meaning. In this case, it's the love triangle situation we've all been through. I figured anyone who's been in love could relate to it. And it seemed to touch home for a lot of folks.\"\nLovett originally considered the song a country tune more appropriate to be sung by Glen Campbell or Charley Pride. He decided to do it with his group. The Manhattans lead singer Gerald Alston is featured in the song starting to sing after Lovett's spoken introduction.\nThe original demo of the song was recorded with The Manhattans backing band, \"Little Harlem.\" After hearing a tape of the recording, producer/arranger Bobby Martin decided to re-record the song with backing by MFSB at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia. Recorded in early 1975, Columbia Records officials withheld releasing the song until 14 months later. Winfred \"Blue\" Lovett had his concerns over when the record came out as well as the record itself. \"I was critical, a perfectionist in the studio, and there are still parts of it that make my skin crawl. For example, in one place, the background vocals go off pitch. Somehow, though, that didn't seem to bother anyone else.\"\nThe full length of \"Kiss and Say Goodbye\" on the album The Manhattans is 4:28. The length of 3:29 on the 7\" single is an edited version of the song.\nThe B-side of the 7\" single contains the song \"Wonderful World of Love\", which was also recorded by The Manhattans for the album The Manhattans. It was written by Robert S. Riley Sr., songwriter and producer/promotion man of the group, who wrote several songs (lyrics) for them. The song was produced by Bobby Martin and The Manhattans.\nReleased as a single, the song became a worldwide hit for the group, ranked number 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, and also on the Billboard R&B chart for one week. The single reaching number 4 on the UK, (where received Silver certification), and number 7 on the Canada, (where received Gold certification). In the U.S., the song was the 400th #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. It also became just the second single to earn Platinum certification status, after the RIAA established the designation in 1976. (Johnnie Taylor's \"Disco Lady\" had been the first a few months earlier.) The single ultimately sold 2.5 million copies. Billboard ranked the song as the No. 6 Pop Singles for 1976 and No. 3 Soul Singles for 1976.\nBesides being the first and only No. 1 pop hit for The Manhattans, \"Kiss and Say Goodbye\" marked 11 years since the group made their first appearance on the Billboard in 1965, with the song \"I Wanna Be (Your Everything)\" (No. 68 on the Hot 100). \"Kiss and Say Goodbye\" ended the decade at No. 83 on the Billboard Top 100 Songs of the 1970s.\nWritten by Winfred Lovett\nArranged by Bobby Martin\nSpoken voice on intro \u2013 Winfred Lovett\nLead vocal \u2013 Gerald Alston\nMusic played (uncredited) \u2013 MFSB\nBackground vocals (uncredited) \u2013 The Manhattans, Barbara Ingram, Evette Benton, Carla Benson\nCredits\nProducer \u2013 Bobby Martin and The Manhattans\nRecording \u2013 Kenny Present\nMastering \u2013 Stuart J.
