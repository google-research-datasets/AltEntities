Written by Mendes, Teddy Geiger, Geoff Warburton and Scott Harris, and produced by Geiger and Andrew Maury, it was released as a single on April 20, 2017. The song was included in the reissue of his second studio album Illuminate (2016). An accompanying music video was released on June 20, 2017. The single reached the top 10 in several countries, including the US and the UK.\n\"There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back\" is a \"dance-y\" pop rock track. A Billboard editor noted it features some electric guitar and \"strained\" vocals on the chorus. As the upbeat track progresses, it incorporates handclaps, funky guitar riffs, and foot-tapping bass. The pre-chorus was inspired by early works of Timbaland and Justin Timberlake.\nWriting for Billboard, Taylor Weatherby noted \"the song's sound falls right in line with the guitar-laced goodness he brought on his sophomore effort, but this time bringing in a little more edge.\" Allison Bowsher for Much opined the sound \"is a return to the earworms that launched Mendes' career back in 2015. Reminiscent of the high energy pop sensibilities of Mendes' \"Something Big,\" today's new track plays with lifts and falls throughout, allowing Mendes to show off the strength of his voice.\" In MTV News, Madeline Roth thought the track is \"more danceable than anything in his catalog. His voice is gritty and hoarse, especially on the passionate, aggressive hook.\"\nTIME chose the song as a contender for one of the songs of the summer, commending the \"smart use of both electric guitar and tropical house beat.\" Billboard considered it the 44th best song of the year, CBC Music named it the 5th.\n\"There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back\" is featured on the Illuminate World Tour setlist. The singer performed the single on The Graham Norton Show on June 9, 2017, at Capital FM's Summertime Ball 2017 on June 10, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on June 19, at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards on August 27, and at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards on 12 November 2017, in which Billboard named his performance the second best of the night. On May 18, 2018, Mendes was a special guest on Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour, and performed the song alongside Swift at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.\nIn the United States, the song has peaked at number 6, becoming Mendes' third top 10 single on the US Billboard Hot 100. In Canada, the song has reached a peak of 6, becoming his highest-charting single in his home country at the time. He has since surpassed this peak with his single \"If I Can't Have You\" which reached number 2 in May 2019. It has reached top 5 in several other countries such as Australia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Scotland, and the United Kingdom, as well as topping the South Korea charts.\nThe music video for the song was released on June 20, 2017. The clip, filmed in Paris, Amsterdam and the United Kingdom, sees Mendes and his love interest (played by actress Ellie Bamber) exploring Europe while the singer is out on tour. The couple races through transportation hubs, ride trains and trek along the coastline. The video also shows footage from Mendes' concerts.

It was composed by drummer Peter Criss, his friend Stan Penridge and producer Bob Ezrin. Casablanca Records released it as a single in August 1976, after it was released as the B-side of \"Detroit Rock City\". \"Beth\" is Kiss's biggest commercial hit in the United States; it reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100, received a Gold Record certification from the RIAA, and won the 1977 People's Choice Award for \"Favorite Song\". In 2003, \"Beth\" ranked #3 in VH1's 25 Greatest Power Ballads.\nThe song, originally titled \"Beck\", was composed by Criss and Penridge during their time with the band Chelsea. During the recording of Destroyer, Criss showed it to Ezrin, who made several changes to it and recommended changing its title to \"Beth\". \"Beth\" has appeared on several compilations and live albums, including Kiss Unplugged (1996), where the group performed it acoustically.\nBy 1975, Kiss had released three studio albums, in which the compositional contributions of drummer Peter Criss were minimal; the only track on which he appeared credited was the instrumental track \"Love Theme from Kiss\", written by the four members of the band and included in their debut album. Criss assumed the role of vocalist in other songs created by his bandmates; however, for Destroyer, Criss set himself the goal of adding one of his own compositions. During a limousine ride, Criss sang a fast-paced version of \"Beck\" for bassist Gene Simmons and guitarist Paul Stanley, assuming they would not be interested in including a sentimental ballad on the album. Simmons and Stanley suggested that he sing it to producer Bob Ezrin, who agreed to record it and assured him that it would be a success.\nDuring Criss's time in Chelsea, he and the group's guitarist Stan Penridge decided to write a mocking song about the wife of their bandmate Mike Brand, Becky. According to Criss, she regularly called the group during rehearsals to ask when her husband would come home, and this gave them the idea of composing the first verse of the song: \"Beck, I hear you callin', but I can't come home right now. Me and the boys are playin', and we just can't find the sound\". Criss later admitted that he composed the song for his first wife, Lydia.\nCriss sang the song to Bob Ezrin, who decided to include it in Destroyer because Kiss' other songs were primarily about sex, and \"Beck\" was a love song that \"everyone would relate to\". Ezrin made several arrangements of the song's melody and wrote part of the lyrics. Gene Simmons suggested changing the name to \"Beth\" because it would be easier to sing and to avoid confusion with Jeff Beck. However, Lydia Criss later claimed credit for proposing the change for the same reason, and because the original Becky had a twin sister named Beth.\nIn his autobiography, Simmons recounted that \"I have never seen [Criss] compose a single song. Peter might have contributed a line or two of the lyrics, but after listening to Penridge's original demo, it's clear who made the original song\". In 2014, during an interview for Rolling Stone, Paul Stanley agreed with Simmons's assessment that Penridge was the main author, and he commented that Criss had nothing to do with the composition of \"Beth\", adding that \"if you write one hit, you should be able to write two\". Criss, in his defense, mentioned that Stanley was jealous because \"he is the main vocalist of a group in which he did not write the greatest success. That's his problem. They hate the fact that I was the songwriter of a hit and won the People's Choice\".\nFor the song's recording, Ezrin brought the New York Philharmonic orchestra and musician Dick Wagner into the A&R studio as a substitute for Ace Frehley. According to Criss and Simmons, Frehley did not participate in the recording because he was engaged in playing cards with friends. Once the orchestra arrived at the studio, Ezrin suggested that all 25 members wear fake tuxedos and that Criss appear in the studio in his trademark makeup so he could take some pictures. For his part, Ezrin put on a top hat and played the grand piano. Finally, Criss recorded the vocals at the Record Plant studio.\nStructurally, \"Beth\" lacks a solo; instead, the mid-octave section repeats the intro along with the chorus in an orchestral interlude. The sound of the violin and viola, led by the cello, change the key from C major to A minor and then the trumpets, tubas, trombones and French horns enter, accentuating the hook.\nThe song was a last-minute addition to"

It was released for digital download on February 10, 2012. \"Turn Up the Music\" is an uptempo song which draws from the genres of electronic dance and house. Instrumentation consists of pulsating beats,  synthesizers, a \"throbbing bass\" and percussion. According to Mason Jr., the song's inspiration came from visualizing Brown as an artist, \"how he dances and how he performs, and giving him something to match that energy.\"\n\"Turn Up the Music\" garnered positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its production and compared the song to Brown's previous singles \"Forever\" (2008) and \"Yeah 3x\" (2010), for its similar musical direction. Critics also noted its similarities to the work of LMFAO and David Guetta. \"Turn Up the Music\" achieved commercial success worldwide, becoming Brown's first number one single on the UK Singles Chart, and his eleventh top ten single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song also reached the top ten in Australia and New Zealand, and the top twenty in Canada, Hungary, Ireland and Slovakia. It was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).\nThe accompanying music video for \"Turn Up the Music\" was directed by Godfrey Taberez and Brown, and filmed in Los Angeles, California. It features Brown at a party filled with masked people, where he performs heavily choreographed dance routines. The video garnered positive reception from critics, for its series of dance sequences which were compared to Michael Jackson. It won Best Male Video and Best Choreography at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, and earned Taberez and Brown a nomination for Video Director of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards. Brown promoted the song with live performances on televised shows and at awards ceremonies, including Dancing with the Stars, Today, the 2012 NBA All-Star Game halftime show, the 54th Grammy Awards, the 2012 Billboard Music Awards and the BET Awards. He also included the song in his set list at Supafest Australia. The official remix of \"Turn Up the Music\" premiered online on February 20, 2012, and features Brown's former girlfriend Rihanna.\n\"Turn Up the Music\" was written by Alexander \"Fuego\" Palmer, Chris Brown, Damon Thomas, Harvey Mason Jr., Michael \"Mike J\" Jimenez, Terence Cole and Agent X. Production for the song was handled by Fuego and The Underdogs. The mixing engineering process was completed by John Hanes with assistance by Phil Seaford, while the audio mixing was completed by Serban Ghenea. \"Turn Up the Music\" was recorded at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California and Mason Sound in North Hollywood, California by Andrew Hey and Brian Springer with assistance by Iain Findley. In an interview with MTV News, Mason Jr. revealed that inspiration for the song came from visualizing Brown as an artist. He explained, \"The inspiration was really him as an artist, visualizing how he dances and how he performs, and giving him something to match that energy.\"\nOn January 25, 2012, Brown announced via his official Twitter account that the lead single from his fifth studio album Fortune would be called \"Turn Up the Music\", tweeting \"New FORTUNE single coming 1/26!!! TURN UP THE MUSIC!!!!\". The following day, both the single and its artwork were posted online, showing Brown wearing an unbuttoned shirt and a fedora, while words in different languages are displayed. \"Turn Up the Music\" was officially sent to contemporary hit radio playlists in the United States on February 7, 2012.

Written by Mendes, Teddy Geiger, Geoff Warburton and Scott Harris, and produced by Geiger and Andrew Maury, it was released as a single on April 20, 2017. The song was included in the reissue of his second studio album Illuminate (2016). An accompanying music video was released on June 20, 2017. The single reached the top 10 in several countries, including the US and the UK.\n\"There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back\" is a \"dance-y\" pop rock track. A Billboard editor noted it features some electric guitar and \"strained\" vocals on the chorus. As the upbeat track progresses, it incorporates handclaps, funky guitar riffs, and foot-tapping bass. The pre-chorus was inspired by early works of Timbaland and Justin Timberlake.\nWriting for Billboard, Taylor Weatherby noted \"the song's sound falls right in line with the guitar-laced goodness he brought on his sophomore effort, but this time bringing in a little more edge.\" Allison Bowsher for Much opined the sound \"is a return to the earworms that launched Mendes' career back in 2015. Reminiscent of the high energy pop sensibilities of Mendes' \"Something Big,\" today's new track plays with lifts and falls throughout, allowing Mendes to show off the strength of his voice.\" In MTV News, Madeline Roth thought the track is \"more danceable than anything in his catalog. His voice is gritty and hoarse, especially on the passionate, aggressive hook.\"\nTIME chose the song as a contender for one of the songs of the summer, commending the \"smart use of both electric guitar and tropical house beat.\" Billboard considered it the 44th best song of the year, CBC Music named it the 5th.\n\"There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back\" is featured on the Illuminate World Tour setlist. The singer performed the single on The Graham Norton Show on June 9, 2017, at Capital FM's Summertime Ball 2017 on June 10, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on June 19, at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards on August 27, and at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards on 12 November 2017, in which Billboard named his performance the second best of the night. On May 18, 2018, Mendes was a special guest on Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour, and performed the song alongside Swift at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.\nIn the United States, the song has peaked at number 6, becoming Mendes' third top 10 single on the US Billboard Hot 100. In Canada, the song has reached a peak of 6, becoming his highest-charting single in his home country at the time. He has since surpassed this peak with his single \"If I Can't Have You\" which reached number 2 in May 2019. It has reached top 5 in several other countries such as Australia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Scotland, and the United Kingdom, as well as topping the South Korea charts.\nThe music video for the song was released on June 20, 2017. The clip, filmed in Paris, Amsterdam and the United Kingdom, sees Mendes and his love interest (played by actress Ellie Bamber) exploring Europe while the singer is out on tour. The couple races through transportation hubs, ride trains and trek along the coastline. The video also shows footage from Mendes' concerts. As of July 2021, the music video has received over 1 billion views, his fourth video to do so. The Music Video was Directed by Jay Martin and Produced by Cal Gordon. The Cinematography was from Thomas Hole.\nThe song is heard in the television series The Good Doctor at the closing of Season 1, Episode 4 in a scene set in a bar. It was also the song used by Dancing with the Stars season 25 winners Jordan Fisher and Lindsay Arnold in their first dance, a tango.  It can also be heard in national TV ads for Ford Motor Company of Australia. The Portuguese supermarket chain Continente used a Portuguese language cover of the song in its 2018 TV Christmas campaign.\nIt also appears in the movie Little Italy with Emma Roberts and Hayden Christensen\nIt's also featured in the trailer for 2021 film Sing 2.\nDigital download (NOTD Remix)\n\"There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back\" (NOTD remix)\u00a0\u2013 3:14\nDigital download (Acoustic)\n\"There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back\" (Acoustic)\u00a0\u2013 3:21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Billboard Adult Contemporary number ones of 2017 and 2018 (U.S.)\n\"There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back\".

(2005). It was released as the album's first single in Australia on 15 August 2005, as a CD single. The song reached number two on the ARIA Charts and number seven in New Zealand. In the United States, the single was promoted early in 2006 by Archie Comics through a mention in issue #167 of the group's namesake Veronica comic, which featured a guest appearance and cover picture of the Veronicas and a card containing a code that could be used to download an MP3 version of the song for free. It was also featured on the first episode of the third season of the MTV series Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County. The song was released as promo for the 2008 Ashley Tisdale's movie Picture This!. Similarly, it was also used in the film She's the Man.\n\"4ever\" was released as The Veronicas' second UK single in late Summer 2009. The track was included on the UK version of the album Hook Me Up which was released shortly afterwards. The song debuted on the UK singles chart at number 197 on 28 September 2009, and moved up one hundred and eighty places to a new peak of 17 the following week. It was re-released in the US as the third single from Hook Me Up. The band re-recorded the vocals for the re-release of the single in the US and the release of the single in the UK. The new vocals are also used in the 2009 music video for the song.\n\"4ever\" was written and produced by Lukasz Gottwald and Max Martin. In an interview with Digital Spy, Lisa described the idea behind the song:\nI think it's just a really fun song. It's got a great guitar riff and the message behind it isn't anything too heavy. It's about living life for the moment, forgetting about your worries and just getting up and dancing. Plus it's a bit bratty, which we like!\nThe original version of the song was recorded in 2005. In 2009, they re-recorded the song to release in the UK and Ireland as their second single. In the press release Jess described the new sound of the 2009 version:\nSince recording \"4ever\", the band has progressed, so we wanted to update the song [...] We recorded more guitars and new vocals to bring the song up to how it sounds when we perform it live.\nThe song has received generally positive reviews. Craig Mathieson from The Age stated that the sisters \"have the pop single of the year in '4ever', a juiced-up slice of stimuli that is constructed so cannily you can't help but love its deviousness.\" Shannon Sanders from Iowa State Daily said the song was \"ever-so-clever\" while Alex Macpherson from The Guardian called it a \"thrilling a piece of power pop... Propelled by a crunchy guitar riff and a twitchy us-against-the-world desperation...\"\nDan Raper of PopMatters said \"the song has a strong girl come-on and a chorus that sounds like 'It's My Life' by Bon Jovi\".\nNick Levine from Digital Spy called the song \"an absolute smash. To put it more precisely, it's a pop-rock stomper with a killer guitar riff, lyrics about seizing the moment and a massive chorus that actually warrants the description 'anthemic'\u2009\". Selby Times compared it to their hit \"Untouched\", saying it \"complements its dynamic rock style with the same attitude and sassiness that made summer hit 'Untouched' so popular.\"\n\"4ever\" was first released in Australia on 15 August 2005, and made its debut on the ARIA Top 50 Singles chart at number five on 28 August. It remained in the top ten for eleven consecutive weeks where it peaked at number two on its tenth week on the chart. The song was certified platinum status by the Australian Recording Industry Association with shipments of over 75,000 copies.\nIn New Zealand, the single made its debut on the New Zealand Singles chart at number seven where it peaked. The single spent seven non-consecutive weeks in the top ten and twenty-three weeks on the chart.\nIn the United States, the single made its debut on the Hot Dance Club Play charts peaking at number 20 on 17 December 2005. It also peaked at number 88 on the Pop 100 chart. In 2006, the song peaked at number twelve on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart where it peaked, failing to break into the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\nThe single had moderate success throughout Europe, reaching the top 40 in"

On 13 May 1996, it was released as their first single and became a worldwide hit entering the top five in Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nIn 2017, BuzzFeed ranked the song number eight on their list of \"The 101 Greatest Dance Songs of the '90s\". In 2021, it was ranked number forty in their list of \"The 50 Best '90s Songs of Summer\".\nSinger Marty Cintron was discovered by German music producer Frank Farian when he played at a club in Ocean Drive, Miami. He suggested that they should do a project together. Cintron then went to Farians studio in Germany. Farian thought the best way to go was with a group, so Cintron introduced him to twin brothers and dancers Ariel and Gabriel Hern\u00e1ndez which he had worked with earlier. They had toured with Prince and been in some of his videos. The first song the group recorded was \"Missing\", which Farian had gotten permission to record after hearing the song in Ibiza. Their version made it to the top 5 in Switzerland and became a big hit throughout Europe. But it was their next single, \"Where Do You Go\", which was released in May 1996, that became an international success. It peaked at number-one in Denmark, Ireland and Scotland.\n\"Where Do You Go\" (Ocean Drive Mix) was featured in the 1998 American comedy film A Night at the Roxbury.\n\"Where Do You Go\" is a dance track with a 4/4 rhythm structure, running at a speed of 127 beats per minute. It is built around a drum beat that was sampled from the Todd Terry remix of the song \"Missing\", by English act Everything But The Girl. The chorus hook \"where do you go, my lovely?\" references Peter Sarstedt's 1969 hit \"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)\".\nAllMusic editor Leo Stanley highlighted the song in his review of No Mercy, stating that \"they have enough hooks and beats to crossover to the charts and dancefloors.\" Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"Look for this Latin male trio to continue Arista's winning streak of slam-dunking Euro-splashed dance ditties on pop radio.\" He added, \"This time, the beats are spiked with fluttering acoustic guitar riffs and making for a jam that will have punters revisiting their fave old hustle dance steps. Icing on the cake is an immediately contagious chorus and an irresistible a cappella breakdown midway through the song. Fun, fun, fun.\" Matt Stopera and Brian Galindo from BuzzFeed noted, \"Spanish guitar + aggressive '90s dance-music beat = perfection.\" A reviewer from Chicago Sun-Times deemed it \"bewitching\". Bob Cannon from Entertainment Weekly said that \"like any good dance track, its hook buries itself deep in your brain.\" He also complimented its \"snazzy flamenco guitar licks and production touches\". Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report commented, \"This trio of experienced dancers/performers will find a warm reception from Top 40 programmers searching for fresh sounds to fill those pop/dance slots. The threesome hail from Miami and are currently breaking in Europe with this polished, uptempo production.\" Howard Cohen for The Miami Herald wrote, \"The club song's sole distinction, aside from its fluttery flamenco guitar licks, is an insistently annoying chorus hook you can't shake.\" Also Diana Valois from The Morning Call stated that its guitar riff \"still sounds irresistible\". Alan Jones from Music Week said it \"shuffles along in much the same style as Missing, with tasteful acoustic guitars and a nicely understated dance beat. Tuneful, well sung and very likely a hit.\"\n\"Where Do You Go\" was very successful on the charts all over the world, peaking at number-one on both the Canadian RPM Dance/Urban chart and the US Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. In Europe, it reached the top spot in Denmark, Ireland and Scotland. The single made it to the Top 10 also in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary (number two), Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK, as well as on the Eurochart Hot 100, where it reached number four. In the UK, \"Where Do You Go\" peaked at number two in its fourth week at the UK Singles Chart, on 2 February 1997. It was held off reaching the top spot by LL Cool J's \"Ain't Nobody\" and spent two weeks at that position. Additionally, it was a Top 20 hit in Finland and a Top 30 hit in Iceland."

It was first released in 1992 in Italy and November 1993 in Spain through Prodisc. In 1994, it was released in the rest of Europe, and experienced worldwide success. The song is written by Italian producers Larry Pignagnoli and Davide Riva, and produced by Pignagnoli. In 1994, the song was included on Carlson's debut album, Whigfield.\nThe single entered at number one on the UK Singles Chart, making Whigfield the first artist to enter at the top in the UK with their debut single, dethroning Wet Wet Wet's 15-week chart-topper \"Love Is All Around\". As of October 2015, \"Saturday Night\" has sold a total of 1.18 million copies in the UK. It also reached number one in Germany, Ireland, Spain and Switzerland, and it became a top-10 hit in Austria, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. In Spain the single spent 11 weeks at the top position. Outside Europe, it peaked at number three in Zimbabwe, number 19 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart and number 78 in Australia. \nNME magazine ranked \"Saturday Night\" at number 15 in their list of the 50 best songs of 1994. It was also nominated for Best Single, while Whigfield was nominated for Best New Act on the 7th annual Smash Hits Awards in 1995.\nWhigfield (AKA Sannie Charlotte Carlson) studied fashion design in Copenhagen and went to Bologna in Italy where she worked as a model by day and as a PR girl for clubs at night. One of the club DJs, Davide Riva, was part of a music production duo. He persuaded her to sing for them. She then visited Italian producer Larry Pignagnoli in his studio and performed a song sample. He hired her to record \"Saturday Night\" and she chose the name Whigfield after an old teacher in Denmark. Larry Pignagnoli already had success with Spagna in the late 1980s and early 1990s before he produced \"Saturday Night\" with Whigfield. They did over 20 takes, then they spliced the best bits together. Whigfield has stated that \"The song is like a nursery rhyme, with lyrics about what girls do when they\u2019re getting ready to go out, and about getting hot when they\u2019re out dancing.\"\nInitially, no record companies were interested in publishing \"Saturday Night\". After it was played frequently in the Spanish radio show World Dance Music, interest in the song began to increase. The first label to pick up the song was a small label, Prodisc in Valencia. It was first released in Italy in 1992, then became a number-one hit in Spain at the end of 1993. In 1994, it became a hit with British holidaymakers on the continent at the end of the year, leading to a huge demand for the track in the United Kingdom. Whigfield was signed for the UK in February 1994 by Christian Tattersfield and Ben Kahn who run London offshoot Systematic. The label decided to delay the release in order to capitalise on the inevitable buzz built up among British tourists returning from summer holidays in Europe. The single was not released in North America until February 1995.\nAllMusic editor William Cooper described \"Saturday Night\" as \"irresistibly catchy\". Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that it \"is a giddy pop/dance ditty that has already saturated radio airwaves throughout Europe. It also has gotten early spins on crossover stations in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Nashville\u2014and rightly so. The tune has a simple, but killer hook that is matched by a jumpy, rave-coated rhythm section and chirpy female vocals.\" David Balls from Digital Spy noted its \"feelgood Euro beats and memorable dance routine\". Irish newspaper Evening Herald declared it as an \"infectious pop classic\". Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger complimented it for being \"one of those iconically simple pop hits\" and for its \"resistibility\". He also added that the song is \"charmingly unassuming, thanks mainly to Whigfield's matter-of-fact performance. If you do stick around, your reward is a lovely bit of house piano heading for the fade. But this song is never pushy. It's Saturday night. Whigfield is having a great time.\" A reviewer from Music & Media described it as a \"melodic\", \"bubblegum-ish\" and \"infectious Euro-pop track\". British magazine Music Week called it \"delightful frothy pop\". James Hamilton from the magazine's RM Dance Update deemed it a \"'Do Wah Diddy Diddy' inspired maddeningly"

(2005). It was released as the album's first single in Australia on 15 August 2005, as a CD single. The song reached number two on the ARIA Charts and number seven in New Zealand. In the United States, the single was promoted early in 2006 by Archie Comics through a mention in issue #167 of the group's namesake Veronica comic, which featured a guest appearance and cover picture of the Veronicas and a card containing a code that could be used to download an MP3 version of the song for free. It was also featured on the first episode of the third season of the MTV series Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County. The song was released as promo for the 2008 Ashley Tisdale's movie Picture This!. Similarly, it was also used in the film She's the Man.\n\"4ever\" was released as The Veronicas' second UK single in late Summer 2009. The track was included on the UK version of the album Hook Me Up which was released shortly afterwards. The song debuted on the UK singles chart at number 197 on 28 September 2009, and moved up one hundred and eighty places to a new peak of 17 the following week. It was re-released in the US as the third single from Hook Me Up. The band re-recorded the vocals for the re-release of the single in the US and the release of the single in the UK. The new vocals are also used in the 2009 music video for the song.\n\"4ever\" was written and produced by Lukasz Gottwald and Max Martin. In an interview with Digital Spy, Lisa described the idea behind the song:\nI think it's just a really fun song. It's got a great guitar riff and the message behind it isn't anything too heavy. It's about living life for the moment, forgetting about your worries and just getting up and dancing. Plus it's a bit bratty, which we like!\nThe original version of the song was recorded in 2005. In 2009, they re-recorded the song to release in the UK and Ireland as their second single. In the press release Jess described the new sound of the 2009 version:\nSince recording \"4ever\", the band has progressed, so we wanted to update the song [...] We recorded more guitars and new vocals to bring the song up to how it sounds when we perform it live.\nThe song has received generally positive reviews. Craig Mathieson from The Age stated that the sisters \"have the pop single of the year in '4ever', a juiced-up slice of stimuli that is constructed so cannily you can't help but love its deviousness.\" Shannon Sanders from Iowa State Daily said the song was \"ever-so-clever\" while Alex Macpherson from The Guardian called it a \"thrilling a piece of power pop... Propelled by a crunchy guitar riff and a twitchy us-against-the-world desperation...\"\nDan Raper of PopMatters said \"the song has a strong girl come-on and a chorus that sounds like 'It's My Life' by Bon Jovi\".\nNick Levine from Digital Spy called the song \"an absolute smash. To put it more precisely, it's a pop-rock stomper with a killer guitar riff, lyrics about seizing the moment and a massive chorus that actually warrants the description 'anthemic'\u2009\". Selby Times compared it to their hit \"Untouched\", saying it \"complements its dynamic rock style with the same attitude and sassiness that made summer hit 'Untouched' so popular.\"\n\"4ever\" was first released in Australia on 15 August 2005, and made its debut on the ARIA Top 50 Singles chart at number five on 28 August. It remained in the top ten for eleven consecutive weeks where it peaked at number two on its tenth week on the chart.

The song features American rapper Ludacris. It was co-written by Ciara, Ludacris, Tricky Stewart, and The-Dream, and produced by the latter two. The song served as the lead single from her fourth studio album, Basic Instinct. The song was first released for digital download on April 23, 2010. \"Ride\" is a down-tempo R&B song, featuring a heavy bass line and seductive tone.\nThe song received generally positive reviews from critics, complimenting the song's toned-down production. It reached number three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in the United States, becoming Ciara's twelfth top ten hit on the chart. The accompanying music video features sexually charged, provocative choreography, and therefore was not aired on BET, and banned from UK music channels. The official remix features Andr\u00e9 3000 and Bei Maejor, in addition to Ludacris.\nJive Records spoke exclusively to Rap Up magazine on March 29, 2010 to confirm that Ciara would be releasing a new song called \"Ride\" featuring Ludacris. It is the fourth time that the two artists have collaborated: the first being 2005's \"Oh\", second being 2009's \"High Price\" and the third being the 2010 remix to Ludacris' single \"How Low\".\nThe song's official remix features Outkast's Andr\u00e9 3000, Bei Maejor and Ludacris. Ciara told MTV News that it was \"cool\" for Andr\u00e9 3000 to respond and get on the record, as the rapper is reclusive when he and Outkast are on break, and selective when it comes to features. Ciara said, \"My team actually kind of helped put that together. My A&R [rep] Mark [Pitts] and [RCA/Jive Label Group Chairman and CEO] Barry Weiss, they kinda worked it out.\" Ciara also confirmed she and 3000 were supposed to collaborate before, commenting: \"When I was doing [2006's] Evolution, I wanted him to do something with me, and we never got to do anything. It's just really great timing now that we get to do something. My fans are getting an unexpected treat with it. He is, from what I understand, very selective and ... protective of his creativity, so it just feels really good to be able to rock with him.\" The remix was released on June 29, 2010 as a digital download.\nThe song has a slow-tempo and \"sensual\" feel, backed by a simple bass line and \"shimmery\" synths, with beats described as \"smooth\", \"heavy\" and \"dragged out.\" Ciara's lyrics have been said to be delivered \"sultry\" and \"seductively.\" Ludacris's flow has been described as \"hypnotizing,\" delivering one of his \"trademark rhyme-filled\" verses. Although the lyrics are technically referring to how one \"rides\" the beat to a song, there are subtle clues of sex in the song.\nBill Lamb of About.com said, \"with the help of Ludacris on guest rap and Tricky Stewart with The-Dream handling production, a fully adult Ciara is back to the sexiness she seems to do best.\" Rap-Up commented that Ciara \"glides over\" the beat and warned listeners to \"Hold on tight.\" BET Sound Off noted while the song was not bad, it lacked personality, and that the Tricky-produced beat did not add excitement to the track. Ed Easton Jr. of WNOW-FM said that the song showed that Ciara and Ludacris continue to show they have chemistry. Idolator commented that the song's \"simple bass line and shimmery synths\" create a \"powerful, hypnotic track that's going to sound great on the dancefloor,\" as Ludacris adds a \"raunchy,\" \"rapid-fire\" verse. The review also said Ciara's longtime collaborators, Tricky Stewart and The-Dream could \"put Ciara back on the map with this one.\"\nAndy Kellman of Allmusic and Allison Stewart of The Washington Post both noted \"Ride\" as a standout track from Basic Instinct. Ken Capobianco of Boston Globe who called the song \"a bump-and-grind\", noted the song as the essential track from the album. Coining it as \"lusty\", the song was Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly's recommended download from the album. \"Ride\" has since been certified Platinum by the RIAA for units exceeding 1 million.\nOn the issue dated April 29, 2010, Ride debuted at number 93 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Eventually the single reached it peaked on the chart at number 42. During the week of May 28, 2010, the song was the number one most added song on urban radio. On the issue dated June 26, 2010, the song jumped from 18 to nine on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, giving Ciara her"

It was written by Jerry Sandusky, Lauren Christy, Julian Bunetta, Krassimir Tsvetanov Kurkchiyski, Shope Trad and Folksong Thrace, while production of the song was helmed by DJ Frank E. \"Breathing\" was initially released as one of four promotional singles for the album in September 2011. It was later released to contemporary hit radio in Australia on October 24, 2011, and elsewhere from January 31, 2012, as the third single from Future History. Musically, \"Breathing\" is a Eurodance song that displays influences of electro and house, and features \"tribal vocal chorales\" in the background. It samples the song \"Pilentze Pee\", which is sung by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir. Lyrical inspiration for the song came from the death of Derulo's cousin, who died in 2011.\n\"Breathing\" garnered positive reviews by many music critics, most of whom praised the production. The song attained moderate chart success, where it peaked inside the top-ten on the singles charts in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Slovakia and Switzerland. Additionally, it reached the top-thirty in France, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song peaked at number 28 on the US Pop Songs chart. \"Breathing\" was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for shipments of 140,000 copies. The accompanying music video was directed by Colin Tilley, and features Derulo in an abandoned warehouse, as well as other scenes of him shirtless in a blue tinted room. Derulo performed \"Breathing\" live at the Belfast City Hall in Northern Ireland, to coincide with the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards. The song has been covered by British recording artist Cher Lloyd.\n\"Breathing\" was written by Jason Derulo, Jacob Luttrell, Lauren Christy, Julian Bunetta, Krassimir Tsvetano Kurkchiyski, Shope Trad and Folksong Thrace, while production of the song was helmed by DJ Frank E. The track was mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, with assistance by Erik Madrid and Chris Galland. Luttrell and Frank E played keyboards on the song, and the drums and synth programming was handled by Frank E. During an interview with Digital Spy, Derulo revealed that the inspiration for \"Breathing\" came from the death of his cousin in 2011. He stated, \"That song means a lot to me as it's serious and heartfelt\". Derulo further explained that \"Breathing\" was heavily influenced by African chants, Eurodance and rock guitar.\n\"Breathing\" was released digitally worldwide on September 9, 2011, as the third promotional single for Future History. The song later impacted contemporary hit radios in Australia on October 24, 2011, as the third official single from the album. In the United States, \"Breathing\" was sent to contemporary hit radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on January 31, 2012. In Germany, it was made available as a CD single on February 24, 2012. In the United Kingdom, a CD single and digital EP, which contains the album version, an instrumental version and three remixes of \"Breathing\", was released on February 26, 2012.\n\"Breathing\" is three minutes and fifty-four seconds long. It is a Eurodance song that displays influences of electro and house. \"Breathing\" is written in the key of B\u266d minor and is set in common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Derulo's vocal range spans from the note of F\u2084 to the note of F\u2086. The song features \"tribal vocal chorales\" in the background, and samples the Bulgarian folk song \"Pilentze Pee\", which is sung by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir. The song contains lyrical content about winning back a past love. \"Breathing\" opens with a \"slow build-up of synths and a quick club beat\" before Derulo sings: \"I only miss you when I'm breathing / I only miss you when my heart is beating / You are the color that I'm bleeding / I only miss you when I'm breathing.\" Scott Shetler of PopCrush noted that he appears to be screaming the vocals during the chorus line: \"I only miss you when I'm breathing\", writing that \"his final note [is] stretched out for several seconds\".\n\"Breathing\" received positive reviews from music critics.

It was written by Tim Bergling, Simon Jeffes, Arash Pournouri, Autumn Rowe, Sandy Wilhelm, with production helmed by Wilhelm under his production name Sandy Vee and Youngboyz. \"Collide\" is a house-inspired love song with instrumentation consisting of piano riffs and a guitar. The song was recorded for Lewis' third studio album Glassheart, but was not included on the album's final track listing.\nUpon the release of the single, Avicii claimed that Lewis and her record label, Syco, had sampled his song \"Penguin\" without his authorisation, and accused them of plagiarism. Before the lawsuit filed by Avicii and his record label reached the high court, Syco announced that the song would be a joint release between Lewis and Avicii. The song premiered in the United Kingdom on 15 July 2011 and was sent to Australian radio on 22 August 2011. \"Collide\" was released digitally via the iTunes Store on 2 September, as part of a collection of the original song, as well as remixes by Afrojack, Cahill, Alex Gaudino and Jason Rooney. The Afrojack remix is included as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of Glassheart.\n\"Collide\" received a mixed reaction from music critics. Some were complimentary of Lewis's vocal performance and compared it to Katy Perry's song \"Firework\", whilst others were critical of its musical structure. The song achieved commercial success, and peaked inside the top five of the singles charts in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom. It also peaked at number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart. As part of promotion for the song, an accompanying music video was shot on a beach in Malibu, California and directed by Ethan Ladder. Lewis also performed the song on the game show Red or Black? and at London nightclub G-A-Y, along with other songs. At the 2012 Grammy Awards, the Afrojack remix was nominated for Best Remixed Recording.\nLewis began planning her third studio album Glassheart in June 2010, shortly after completing her first headline tour: The Labyrinth. \"Collide\" was written by Arash Pournouri, Autumn Rowe, Sandy Wilhelm, Simon Jeffes and Tim Berg, with production of the song helmed by Wilhelm (under his production name Sandy Vee) and Youngboyz. On 14 July 2011, Lewis announced via her official Twitter account that the song would premiere in the United Kingdom on The Scott Mills Show radio talk show the following day on 15 July, saying \"So excited to let u know to tune into Scott Mills show on Radio One tomorrow for the worldwide exclusive play of my summer single 'Collide' (sic).\" With regard to the song, Lewis spoke about \"Collide\" and why she chose to release it as the lead single, saying\nI'm excited for people to see a different side to my music. I'm a fan of so many different genres and styles. For me this song has all the great ingredients of a summer anthem. I can't wait for my fans to hear it and to share the rest of the album.\n\"Collide\" was released to Australian mainstream radio on 22 August 2011. On 2 September 2011, \"Collide\" was released to download digitally via iTunes as part of a collection of the original song as well as remixes by Afrojack, Cahill, Alex Gaudino and Jason Rooney, in Austria, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States. In Germany, the song was released as a CD single on 16 September 2011. Glassheart was originally set to be released in November 2011 following \"Collide\", however the album was subsequently pushed back several times into early 2012, then Summer 2012, before settling on October 2012.\nSoon after \"Collide\" premiered, the song received comparisons to an instrumental dance track called \"Penguin\" by Swedish DJ and recorded producer Avicii. Avicii's \"Penguin\" samples the instrumental of \"Perpetuum Mobile\" by Penguin Cafe Orchestra. The song originally credited Lewis as the only artist on the track, which prompted a lawsuit against Lewis, and her record label Syco, as Avicii claimed that they had sampled his version of the song without his permission. According to Avicii's manager Ash Pournouri, he thought that Lewis was going to only sample the original version by Penguin Cafe Orchestra. In a statement, Pournouri said \"We were under the impression that they were going to sample the original. They ended up copying our version. We never allowed Syco to replay our version of the track.

It remains one of their most successful hits, alongside \"Sweet Dreams\" and was dubbed into many megamix tracks and has had several remix versions. In the US, it reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and also topped the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play for two weeks in December 1995. In Europe, the single hit number-one in Germany, Sweden and on the Eurochart Hot 100. To date, it has sold six million copies worldwide.\nIn 2000, when Melanie Thornton left the group to start with her solo career, La Bouche released a new version of \"Be My Lover\" with vocals by Natascha Wright, who replaced Thornton as the female singer of the group.\nAmerican rapper Lane McCray met singer Melanie Thornton in Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany while he was on active duty in the US Air Force. Thornton had moved from the US to Germany, where she performed as guest vocalist on dance-pop recordings.\nThey went together in a band called Groovin' Affairs and were discovered by German record producer Frank Farian, the mastermind and voice behind the duo Milli Vanilli and prior Boney M. Then they founded the Eurodance duo La Bouche. McCray and Thornton wrote \"Be My Lover\" together and started recording in the spring of 1994. Because of McCray's duty in the US Air Force, La Bouche's success faced one minor challenge. But the duo went on becoming one of the most popular Eurodance acts of the mid-90s.\nThe song is written in the key of C\u266f minor and follows a tempo of 134 beats per minute.  It follows a basic chord progression of C\u266fm\u2013A\u2013B, and the vocals span from G\u266f\u2083 to F\u266f\u2085.\nAmerican newspaper The Atlanta Journal-Constitution described the song as a \"high-energy hit\". Matt Stopera and Brian Galindo from BuzzFeed ranked it number 6 in their list of \"The 101 Greatest Dance Songs of the '90s\" in 2017, adding that \"when you think of a '90s dance artist or group, La Bouche is on that list. A legend.\" Beth D'Addono from Delaware County Daily Times commented, \"La da da dee da da da dah... Then that infectious disco beat kicks in, and \"Be My Lover\" blares from the car radio, takes over the dance floor, reverberates through the health club, inspiring step classes to even greater heights.\" Bianca Gracie from Idolator declared it as a \"blood-pumping\" tune \"that combined energetic waves of synths with incredibly soulful vocals that kept bodies moving way longer than those endless rounds of Sex On The Beach cocktails ever could!\". She added that \"Be My Lover\" \"still provides a sense of euphoric escape that continues to refuel the spirit.\" James Arena, the writer of Stars of '90s Dance Pop: 29 Hitmakers Discuss Their Careers called the song \"blistering\", adding that it, with \"Sweet Dreams\", \"are widely regarded today as indispensable classics of the decade.\" \nJames Masterton stated in his weekly UK chart commentary, that it \"could well turn out to be one of the pop smashes of the year. Right from the 'La Da Da De Dah' introduction and hook this is one Euro-hit that has 'floor-filler' written all over it. Top 10 within a fortnight, just watch.\" A reviewer from Music Week rated it three out of five, adding that \"this fairly standard piece of Europop is unlikely to top labelmates Real McCoy in the UK.\" Alan Jones noted \"the accomplished diva vocals\" and \"acute commercial nature\" of the song. James Hamilton from the magazine's RM Dance Update described it as a \"infectiously 'la de dah'-ed German smash by a Frankfurt based US duo in the usual Euro style\". Jim Farber from New York Daily News deemed it a \"Euro-disco plea\", that \"sounds so freakishly retro.\" People Magazine wrote that it \"underscore buoyant vocals with dark minor-key arrangements\". Richmond Times-Dispatch's reviewer commented, \"I am insanely jealous of the lead female vocal, Melanie Thornton. She has a wonderful, flexible voice.\" The Tampa Tribune stated that her vocals \"are a little better than those of the average disco songstress.\" Vibe included \"Be My Lover\" in their list of \"30 Dance Tracks From The '90s That Changed The Game\" in 2013.\n\"Be My Lover\" topped both the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play and the Canadian RPM Dance Chart, and reached the Top 10 of Billboard's Hot 100. It peaked at number-one in Germany and Sweden, and at number 2 in Australia, Iceland, Italy and Norway. \"Be My"

It was written by Edmund \"Eddie Hustle\" Clement and Anita McCloud and produced by Clement for Usher's third studio album 8701 (2001). A mid-tempo contemporary R&B track, the song is about a man who meets a woman who seems like a nice catch, but he decides not to enter a relationship with her because she looks too much like an ex-girlfriend with whom he had a bad breakup.\nThe song served as the lead American single from 8701 following the release of previous single \"Pop Ya Collar\", which was only included in some editions of the album. \"U Remind Me\" topped the US Billboard Hot 100 on July 7, 2001, and also reached the top five in Australia, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The song won Usher his first Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2002. Its accompanying music video features Chilli of TLC as one of the female leads.\n\"U Remind Me\" is a contemporary R&B song written in the key of G\u266d major, and is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 92 beats per minute. The song follows the chord progression of E\u266dm\u2087-A\u266dm\u2087-B\u266dm\u2087, and the piano ranges from the low note of E\u266d\u2082 to the high note of A\u266d\u2085, while Usher's vocal range stretches from B\u266d\u2082 to A\u266d\u2085.\nThe song's lyrics are based on meeting a woman who reminds Usher of an ex-girlfriend, and therefore cannot date her.\nJames Poletti of Yahoo! Music noted the song as the best track on 8701, dubbing it the 2001 version of Craig David's \"Fill Me In\". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine also chose it as a highlight from the album. In 2010, Boonsri Dickinson of AOL Radio ranked \"U Remind Me\" as Usher's ninth-best song.\n\"U Remind Me\" gained Usher his first Grammy Award, winning the category of Best Male R&B Vocal Performance at the 44th annual ceremony. Other nominees for the award were Case's \"Missing You\", Maxwell's \"Lifetime\", Brian McKnight's \"Love of My Life\" and Musiq Soulchild's \"Love\".\nThe accompanying music video for the song was directed by Dave Meyers. The video features look-a-likes for singers M\u00fda, Brandy, and Tamia, while featuring the real Chilli of TLC at the end to show the theme of the women reminding him of his past relationships. The video was filmed in April 2001.\nCassette, US and European CD\n\"U Remind Me\" (radio edit)\n\"U Remind Me\" (instrumental)\n\"I Don't Know\" (featuring P Diddy)\n\"TTP\"\nUK CD\n\"U Remind Me\"\n\"I Don't Know\" (featuring P.

It was written by James Scheffer, Frank Romano, Danny Morris and Rico Love, with the latter producing the song with Jim Jonsin. The song was first released as the second promo single for his sixth studio album, Raymond v. Raymond (2010) on February 9, 2010, and later released to rhythmic and urban airplay as the album's fourth U.S. single from the album on June 15, 2010. It was later included the EP's follow-up set, Versus EP. \"There Goes My Baby\" is a down-tempo R&B piece, which makes use of Usher's falsetto range.\nWhile reaching a peak of twenty-five on the Billboard Hot 100, it topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The charting gave Usher his eleventh number-one on the chart, tying Ray Charles and R. Kelly for the fifth-most number-one's since the chart's inception. The song's accompanying music video features Usher pursuing his love interest in risque scenes. Usher performed the song a number of times, including at the 2010 BET Awards. The song earned Usher a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance, at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards on February 13, 2011.\n\"There Goes My Baby\" is a, \"slinky\" down-tempo R&B ballad, with infused hints of neo soul. It is composed in a \"moderate groove\" of eighty beats per minute, and is set in common time. It is written the key of A major and Usher's vocals span from the low note of E\u2083 to high note of C\u2085. It follows the chord progression A\u2013F\u2098\u2090\u2c7c\u2087\u2013G. The song makes use of Usher's falsetto range, which was warmly received by critics. Edna Gunderson of USA Today called Usher's falsetto \"charming.\"  Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music UK said that the song was a delight and that its falsetto tenderness was absent in the rest of the work. Tyler Lewis of PopMatters said the song featured \"nice falsetto work\" from the singer, while Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly coined the song a \"falsetto-laced plea.\"\nAndy Kellman of Allmusic noted the track as a standout from Raymond v. Raymond. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that the sweetness of Usher's falsetto balanced out the album's \"boilerplate swagger.\" Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music thought that the song recalled Usher's past slow jams, coining it, \"a sumptuous deep-pile carpet of seductive song.\" Ashante Infantry of the Toronto Star said the song was one of the best on the album, and said that it was a \"steamy slow jam.\" Calling the song \"decent,\" James Reed of the Boston Globe thought the lyrical content was hollow. Calling it a low-point of the album, Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine said that the song was \"sappy.\"\nAs a promo single, the song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number seventy-one solely from digital downloads. It fell off the next week, but upon its release as a single it re-entered at number 100, and eventually reached number twenty-five. It topped the US R&B/Hip-Hop chart for four consecutive weeks, giving Usher his eleventh number-one hit on that chart, and to date spent there the huge amount of 71 weeks. With eleven top singles on the chart, Usher tied with R. Kelly and Ray Charles on the Stevie Wonder-led list of most number ones since the inception of the chart. As the fourth single from Raymond v. Raymond, the single was also Usher's fourth consecutive top ten song on the R&B chart, a feat not matched by him since his Confessions era. \"There Goes My Baby\" was also Usher's fourth consecutive top forty song on the Hot 100, another feat not matched since Confessions.\n\nThe accompanying music video for the song was filmed on June 16, 2010 in Malibu, California, and directed by Anthony Mandler. It took fifteen hours for the shoot. Preparing his physique for the filming, the singer told People, \"At 31, when you take your shirt off, you must have it together!\" A preview of the video was released on July 12, 2010, and the full video premiered on 106 & Park and Vevo on July 13, 2010.\n\nContaining a vague plot, the opening scene of the clip features Usher donning a black tank top and dark jeans, while he stands in a field with the sun rising in the background. While performing t'ai chi-inspired dance moves, he begins to pursue his love interest, and appears shirtless in front of a black backdrop. \n Appearing alongside his interest in the backdrop scenes, Usher then sings propped on a concrete wall in a dark alley, while he and the woman tease each other, before moving outside on the balcony of a house on top of mountains. The singer performs acrobatic moves, including"

Written by vocalist Eddie Vedder, \"I Am Mine\" was released on September 23, 2002, as the first single from the band's seventh studio album, Riot Act (2002). The song peaked at number six on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003).\n\"I Am Mine\" was written by vocalist Eddie Vedder in a hotel room near Virginia Beach, Virginia before the band's first show after the Roskilde tragedy in 2000. Vedder said that he wrote the song to \"reassure myself that this is going to be all right.\"\nDrummer Matt Cameron on \"I Am Mine\":\nIt seems like it has all the elements this band is known for: strong lyrics, strong hook, and a good sense of melody. It wasn't a really tough decision to have that be the starting point for the record.\nThe lyrics for \"I Am Mine\" tackle existential matters. At the band's April 8, 2003 show in New Orleans, Louisiana at the UNO Lakefront Arena, Vedder stated, \"This song is about what's inside you. You own it, and you have the freedom for it to come out. It's allowed to come out.\" At the band's July 8, 2003 show in New York City at Madison Square Garden, Vedder stated, \"This song\u2019s about personal safety, and the feeling of being secure, and even free.\"\n\"I Am Mine\" was released as a single in 2002 in various versions with the previously unreleased B-sides \"Down\" and \"Undone\", both of which can also be found on the compilation album, Lost Dogs (2003), the latter as an alternate version. \"I Am Mine\" was the most successful song from Riot Act on the American rock charts. The song peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100, number seven on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and number six on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. In Canada, the song reached the top ten on the Canadian Singles Chart. Outside North America, \"I Am Mine\" reached the top 30 in the United Kingdom and peaked at number 12 in Australia, where it was certified gold. The track reached the top 50 in New Zealand, the top 40 in Ireland, the top 30 in Sweden, the top 20 in Finland, and the top 10 in Italy, Norway, and Portugal.\nThe music video for \"I Am Mine\" was directed by James Frost. The video was filmed at Seattle, Washington's Chop Suey club in September 2002. The video consists of a filmed live performance of the band rather than a conceptual video. It was one of five videos shot at the club to promote Riot Act (including \"Save You\", \"Love Boat Captain\", \"Thumbing My Way\", and \"1/2 Full\"). Up to that point, the band had not made any music videos since 1998's \"Do the Evolution\". The video was released in October 2002.\n\"I Am Mine\" was first performed live at Neil Young's 2001 Bridge School Benefit. The band played this song when it appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman in November 2002 in support of Riot Act. Live performances of \"I Am Mine\" can be found on various official bootlegs and the Live at the Gorge 05/06 box set. Performances of the song are also included on the DVDs Live at the Showbox and Live at the Garden.\nAll songs are written by Eddie Vedder except where noted.\nCD (US, Canada, and Europe) and 7-inch vinyl (Europe)\n\"I Am Mine\"\n\"Down\" (Stone Gossard, Mike McCready, Vedder)\n7-inch vinyl (US)\nA. \"I Am Mine\"\nB. \"Undone\"\nCD (Australia) and maxi-single (Europe)\n\"I Am Mine\"\n\"Down\" (Gossard, McCready, Vedder)\n\"Bushleaguer\" (Gossard, Vedder)\n\"Undone\"\nCD (UK)\n\"I Am Mine\" (album version) \u2013 3:35\n\"Bushleaguer\" (album version) (Gossard, Vedder) \u2013 3:57\n\"Undone\" \u2013 3:08\n\n\n\n\n\"New Pearl Jam takes on minimalism, Bush\".

It reached the number five spot on both the Mainstream and Modern Rock Billboard charts. It did not originally chart on the regular Billboard Hot 100 singles chart since it was not released as a commercial single in the US at the time, but a re-release in July 1995 brought it up to number 79.\nThe song gained popularity for its music video, directed by Mark Pellington and released in 1992, which received heavy rotation by MTV and became a hit.

In 1993, the \"Jeremy\" video was awarded four MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Video of the Year.\n\"Jeremy\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by bassist Jeff Ament. The song's music was written before the band went out on tour in support of Alice in Chains in February 1991.\nAment on the song:\nI already had two pieces of music that I wrote on acoustic guitar...with the idea that I would play them on a Hamer 12-string bass I had just ordered. When the bass arrived, one of [the pieces] became \"Jeremy\"...I had an idea for the outro when we were recording it the second time...I overdubbed a twelve-string bass, and we added a cello. That was big-time production, for us....Rick [Parashar]\u2019s a supertalented engineer-musician...Stone [Gossard, Pearl Jam\u2019s rhythm guitarist] was sick one day, and Ed, Rick and I conjured up the art piece that opens and closes the song. That was so fun\u2014I wanted to make a whole record like that.\nIn another interview, Ament stated:\nWe knew it was a good song, but it was tough getting it to feel right\u2014for the chorus to sit back and the outro to push over the top. The tune went from practically not making it on the record to being one of the best takes. I'm not sure if it's the best song on the album but I think it's the best take. On \"Jeremy\" I always heard this other melody in the choruses and the end, and it never sounded good on guitar or bass. So we brought in a cello player which inspired a background vocal, and those things made the song really happen. Most of the time if something doesn't work right away, I just say fuck it\u2014but this was an instance when perseverance paid off.\n\"Jeremy\" is based on two different true stories. The song takes its main inspiration from a newspaper article about a 15-year-old boy named Jeremy Wade Delle from Richardson, Texas, who shot himself in front of his teacher and his second period English class of 30 students on the morning of January 8, 1991. In a 2009 interview, Vedder said that he felt \"the need to take that small article and make something of it\u2014to give that action, to give it reaction, to give it more importance.\"\nDelle was described by schoolmates as \"real quiet\" and known for \"acting sad\". After coming into class late that morning, Delle was told to get an admittance slip from the school office. He left the classroom, and returned with a .357 Magnum revolver. Delle walked to the front of the classroom, announced \"Miss, I got what I really went for\", put the barrel of the firearm in his mouth, and pulled the trigger before his teacher or classmates could react. Lisa Moore, a schoolmate, knew Jeremy from the in-school suspension program: \"He and I would pass notes back and forth and he would talk about life and stuff,\" she said. \"He signed all of his notes, 'Write back.' But on Monday he wrote, 'Later days.' I didn't know what to make of it. But I never thought this would happen.\"\nWhen asked about the song, Vedder explained:\nIt came from a small paragraph in a paper which means you kill yourself and you make a big old sacrifice and try to get your revenge. That all you're gonna end up with is a paragraph in a newspaper. Sixty-four degrees and cloudy in a suburban neighborhood. That's the beginning of the video and that's the same thing in the end; it does nothing \u2026 nothing changes. The world goes on and you're gone. The best revenge"

After coming into class late that morning, Delle was told to get an admittance slip from the school office. He left the classroom, and returned with a .357 Magnum revolver. Delle walked to the front of the classroom, announced \"Miss, I got what I really went for\", put the barrel of the firearm in his mouth, and pulled the trigger before his teacher or classmates could react. Lisa Moore, a schoolmate, knew Jeremy from the in-school suspension program: \"He and I would pass notes back and forth and he would talk about life and stuff,\" she said. \"He signed all of his notes, 'Write back.' But on Monday he wrote, 'Later days.' I didn't know what to make of it. But I never thought this would happen.\"\nWhen asked about the song, Vedder explained:\nIt came from a small paragraph in a paper which means you kill yourself and you make a big old sacrifice and try to get your revenge. That all you're gonna end up with is a paragraph in a newspaper. Sixty-four degrees and cloudy in a suburban neighborhood. That's the beginning of the video and that's the same thing in the end; it does nothing \u2026 nothing changes. The world goes on and you're gone. The best revenge"

It appears as the second track on the band's second album, Nevermind, released by DGC Records in September 1991.\nThe album version is the second of two versions of the song that were released in 1991, the earlier of which was recorded in 1990, while the band was still signed to their original record label, Sub Pop. This version was initially released as a music video only, on the Sub Pop Video Network Volume 1 VHS compilation.\n\"In Bloom\" was released as the album's fourth and final single in November 1992 and generated heavy American airplay, reaching number 5 on the US Mainstream Rock chart, despite never being released as a physical single in the United States. The international release of the single made the Top 10 in Ireland and Portugal, as well as the Top 20 in Finland and New Zealand and the Top 30 in Sweden and the United Kingdom. It was accompanied by a new music video, directed by Kevin Kerslake, which won Best Alternative Video at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards.\nAccording to Nirvana's bassist Krist Novoselic, \"In Bloom\" \"originally sounded like a Bad Brains song,\" before being slowed down and reworked by Cobain at home. In a 2002 Rolling Stone interview with David Fricke, Novoselic recalled that Cobain \"went home and [he] hammered it. He kept working on it. Then he called me on the phone and said, 'Listen to this song.' He started singing it on the phone. You could hear the guitar. It was the 'In Bloom' of Nevermind, more of a pop thing.\"\nThe song was first performed live on April 1, 1990 at the Cabaret Metro in Chicago. The following day, the band began work on recording a new release for their then-label Sub Pop, at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin with producer Butch Vig. Among the eight songs recorded during the five-day session was \"In Bloom,\" which originally featured a bridge that Vig removed by physically cutting it out of the 16-track master tape with a razor blade, and throwing in the garbage. The original plan of releasing the songs recorded during this session on a single release were abandoned later in the year, after the exit of drummer Chad Channing. The band instead used the material as a demo tape, which circulated amongst the music industry and generated interest in the group among major record labels. However, a few songs from the session still appeared on various official releases in 1990 and 1991. \"In Bloom\" was released as a music video only, on the Sub Pop Video Network Volume 1 VHS compilation in 1991.\nThe song was re-recorded by Vig at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California in May 1991, during the sessions for the band's second album and major label debut, Nevermind. It was one of the first songs worked on during the sessions, due to Vig's familiarity with it from his previous session with the band. Like the other songs recorded at Smart Studios, the arrangement for \"In Bloom\" was left mostly unchanged, with the band's new drummer Dave Grohl staying close to what Channing had played.\nAccording to Vig, Cobain's impatience with recording multiple vocal takes made it difficult to acquire a master vocal take. In the 2005 documentary Classic Albums: Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind, Vig revealed the methods he used to get Cobain to record multiple takes, which included tricking him into believing that certain parts were not properly recorded and needed to be done again, and reminding him that the Beatles' John Lennon double-tracked his vocals in the studio. The varying intensity of Cobain's vocals from one take to the next, and from the verses to the choruses, also presented a problem for Vig, who had to adjust the input levels \"on the fly\" while recording Cobain.  Ultimately, Vig was able to edit several takes together into a single master, due to the consistency of Cobain's vocal phrasing.\nVig also decided to have Grohl sing high harmonies, double-tracking them as he did with Cobain's. Grohl initially had difficulty hitting the proper notes, but ultimately was able to sing what Vig wanted. The original studio version of \"In Bloom\" featured no harmonies, possibly due to time constraints.\n\"In Bloom\" was performed for the final time live on March 1, 1994 at Terminal Einz in"

It is the fourth song on the band's third and final studio album, In Utero, released in September 1993. It is also Nirvana's last single release before Cobain committed suicide in 1994.\n\"Rape Me\" was released as the album's second single in December 1993, packaged as a double A-side with \"All Apologies\". The single reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\"Rape Me\" was written by Cobain on an acoustic guitar in Los Angeles in May 1991, around the time the band's second album, Nevermind, was being mixed. It was first performed live on June 18, 1991, at The Catalyst in Santa Cruz. The earliest live versions of the song featured a guitar solo instead of a bridge.\nThe song's lyrics led to controversy even before it had been officially released. The band had wanted to play \"Rape Me\" during their appearance at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, but the network believed the song was a direct attack on them, and insisted they perform their breakthrough single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" instead. The ongoing argument between MTV and Cobain escalated over the span of several days, with MTV threatening to cut Nirvana from the show, to stop playing the band's music videos, and even to boycott other artists on the band's management company, Gold Mountain. Cobain only relented after being informed that MTV would fire Amy Finnerty, an MTV employee and friend of the band's, if the band played \"Rape Me\". The band ultimately agreed to play their latest single, \"Lithium,\" but not before Cobain started playing the chords and singing the opening lines of \"Rape Me,\" which resulted in the live broadcast almost going to commercial.\n\"Rape Me\" was first recorded in the studio in October 1992, during a two-day demo session with Jack Endino at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington. Two takes of the song were recorded, one of which was instrumental, the other featuring lead vocals by Cobain and backing vocals by drummer Dave Grohl. Cobain was holding his then-infant daughter Frances Bean Cobain on his lap when he recorded his vocals, and she can be heard crying on the demo.\nThe final studio version of \"Rape Me\" was recorded in February 1993 by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, for the band's third and final studio album, In Utero. The instruments for the song were recorded on February 15. The following day, Cobain completed his vocals for the album during a reported six-hour session. Cobain used his Fender Jaguar guitar plugged into a Twin Reverb amp.\nOn September 25, 1993, the band performed the song, along with \"Heart-Shaped Box,\" on Saturday Night Live at NBC Studios in New York City. It was the band's first show with second guitarist Pat Smear. The song was again performed on television on February 4, 1994 for the show Nulle Part Ailleurs in Paris, France.\nThe final live performance of \"Rape Me\" was at Nirvana's last concert at Terminal 1 of Munich-Riem Airport on March 1, 1994.\n\nThe song's instrumental opening bars, which features Cobain using pick scratching while playing the verse chord progression, has led to frequent comparisons to the guitar riff of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Will Bryant of Pitchfork wrote that \"the four-chord riff that drags the song through the motions is an almost direct inversion of the famous 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' riff,\" while Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross described the song as having \"the same catchy soft/loud dynamic as \"Teen Spirit,\" which \"created a perfect Cobain aesthetic \u2013 beautiful, haunting and disturbing.\" \"Rape Me\" was written after \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" but before Nevermind had been released.\n\"Rape Me\" is an anti-rape song, written from the point of view of the victim. \"It's like she's saying, 'Rape me, go ahead, rape me, beat me,'\" Cobain told Darcey Steinke of Spin in 1993, \"'You'll never kill me. I'll survive this and I'm gonna fucking rape you one of these days and you won't even know it.'\" Gillian G. Garr described the song's lyrics as \"part submissive invitation, part"

The song was inspired by a newspaper article Vedder read about Jeremy Wade Delle, a high school student who shot himself in front of his English class on January 8, 1991. It reached the number five spot on both the Mainstream and Modern Rock Billboard charts. It did not originally chart on the regular Billboard Hot 100 singles chart since it was not released as a commercial single in the US at the time, but a re-release in July 1995 brought it up to number 79.\nThe song gained popularity for its music video, directed by Mark Pellington and released in 1992, which received heavy rotation by MTV and became a hit. The original music video for \"Jeremy\" was directed and produced by Chris Cuffaro. Epic Records and MTV later rejected the music video, and released the version directed by Pellington instead.  In 1993, the \"Jeremy\" video was awarded four MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Video of the Year.\n\"Jeremy\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by bassist Jeff Ament. The song's music was written before the band went out on tour in support of Alice in Chains in February 1991.\nAment on the song:\nI already had two pieces of music that I wrote on acoustic guitar...with the idea that I would play them on a Hamer 12-string bass I had just ordered. When the bass arrived, one of [the pieces] became \"Jeremy\"...I had an idea for the outro when we were recording it the second time...I overdubbed a twelve-string bass, and we added a cello. That was big-time production, for us....Rick [Parashar]\u2019s a supertalented engineer-musician...Stone [Gossard, Pearl Jam\u2019s rhythm guitarist] was sick one day, and Ed, Rick and I conjured up the art piece that opens and closes the song. That was so fun\u2014I wanted to make a whole record like that.\nIn another interview, Ament stated:\nWe knew it was a good song, but it was tough getting it to feel right\u2014for the chorus to sit back and the outro to push over the top. The tune went from practically not making it on the record to being one of the best takes. I'm not sure if it's the best song on the album but I think it's the best take. On \"Jeremy\" I always heard this other melody in the choruses and the end, and it never sounded good on guitar or bass. So we brought in a cello player which inspired a background vocal, and those things made the song really happen. Most of the time if something doesn't work right away, I just say fuck it\u2014but this was an instance when perseverance paid off.\n\"Jeremy\" is based on two different true stories. The song takes its main inspiration from a newspaper article about a 15-year-old boy named Jeremy Wade Delle from Richardson, Texas, who shot himself in front of his teacher and his second period English class of 30 students on the morning of January 8, 1991. In a 2009 interview, Vedder said that he felt \"the need to take that small article and make something of it\u2014to give that action, to give it reaction, to give it more importance.\"\nDelle was described by schoolmates as \"real quiet\" and known for \"acting sad\". After coming into class late that morning, Delle was told to get an admittance slip from the school office. He left the classroom, and returned with a .357 Magnum revolver. Delle walked to the front of the classroom, announced \"Miss, I got what I really went for\", put the barrel of the firearm in his mouth, and pulled the trigger before his teacher or classmates could react. Lisa Moore, a schoolmate, knew Jeremy from the in-school suspension program: \"He and I would pass notes back and forth and he would talk about life and stuff,\" she said. \"He signed all of his notes, 'Write back.' But on Monday he wrote, 'Later days.' I didn't know what to make of it.

Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Mike McCready, \"Given to Fly\" was released to radio on December 22, 1997, as the first single from the band's fifth studio album, Yield (1998).\n\"Given to Fly\" proved to be the album's most popular single. The song topped the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and eventually peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. Worldwide, the single charted well, reaching number five in Finland, number six in Norway and Spain, and the top 20 in Australia, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003).\n\"Given to Fly\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Mike McCready, although loosely based on Led Zeppelin's \"Going to California\". McCready said he came up with the guitar riff after being stuck in his condo on a snowy day in Seattle. McCready on the song:\nIt was snowing here in Seattle, which it rarely does, and so they kind of shut down all the streets and I couldn't get my car out of the driveway. And I have a Volvo and you'd think those would be able to drive in the snow, but no, it wasn't going anywhere, so I was kind of stuck in my condo. And I wrote that riff [for \"Given to Fly\"] and the \"Faithfull\" riff that day.\nThe main riff is written in the DADGAD alternate tuning. Regarding the song, McCready said, \"I just kind of imagined [\"Given to Fly\"] as sort of a wave in an ocean: It starts out slow and then it gets a little larger and a little larger and then it breaks and then it comes down again. And that's metaphorically how I think of that song.\" Drummer Jack Irons stated that \"on \"Given to Fly\", I play a beat that's based around the toms, but it's pretty soft. I'm not sure I would have been comfortable playing that way a few years ago.\"\nVedder about \"Given to Fly\":\n[I imagined the song as] a 20-page cardboard (children's) book with a line on each page and a picture to go with it. It's a fable, that's all. The music almost gives you this feeling of flight, and I really love singing the part at the end, which is all about rising above anybody's comments about what you do and still giving your love away. You know? Not becoming bitter and reclusive, not condemning the whole world because of the actions of a few.\n\"Given to Fly\" was released to radio on December 22, 1997, and was issued as a CD and cassette single on January 6, 1998, with a previously unreleased B-side titled \"Leatherman\" (about the 19th century vagabond known by that name). \"Given to Fly\" was featured in a commercial advertising Yield which emulated the album's cover art. \"Given to Fly\" became the most successful song from Yield on the American rock charts. The song peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and number three on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song spent a total of six weeks at number one on the Mainstream Rock chart, and ten weeks at number three on the Modern Rock chart.\nOutside the United States, the single became a moderate hit. In Canada, it reached the top 30 on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart and later appeared on the RPM Alternative 30, where it reached number one and became Pearl Jam's second single to top that chart. \"Given to Fly\" reached the UK top 20 and peaked at number 13 on the Australian Singles Chart. It reached number 67 in Germany, the top 40 in the Netherlands and Switzerland, the top 30 in Sweden, the top 20 in Ireland and New Zealand and the top 10 in Finland, Norway and Spain.\nIn AllMusic's review of the \"Given to Fly\" single, it was stated that \"Given to Fly\" is \"a soaring epic that goes a long way in conveying Yield's majestic splendor. Frontman Eddie Vedder narrates the tale of a misunderstood, near-Messianic youth in front of hushed verses that explode into stratospheric choruses.\" Billboard called \"Given to Fly\" \"a slow-building rocker that doesn't risk scaring off die-hards\" in its review of the song. In addition, it was stated that \"it's catchy and crisp enough to make the grade with popsters.\"\nThe guitar part and main vocal melody in the song have been noted for their similarities to Led Zeppelin's \"Going to California\" from the 1971 album Led Zeppelin IV. Tom Lanham of Entertainment Weekly said in his review of the song, \"This latest PJ perambulator not only apes vintage Page/Plant latticework but also"

The song was inspired by a newspaper article Vedder read about Jeremy Wade Delle, a high school student who shot himself in front of his English class on January 8, 1991. It reached the number five spot on both the Mainstream and Modern Rock Billboard charts. It did not originally chart on the regular Billboard Hot 100 singles chart since it was not released as a commercial single in the US at the time, but a re-release in July 1995 brought it up to number 79.\nThe song gained popularity for its music video, directed by Mark Pellington and released in 1992, which received heavy rotation by MTV and became a hit. The original music video for \"Jeremy\" was directed and produced by Chris Cuffaro. Epic Records and MTV later rejected the music video, and released the version directed by Pellington instead.  In 1993, the \"Jeremy\" video was awarded four MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Video of the Year.\n\"Jeremy\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by bassist Jeff Ament. The song's music was written before the band went out on tour in support of Alice in Chains in February 1991.\nAment on the song:\nI already had two pieces of music that I wrote on acoustic guitar...with the idea that I would play them on a Hamer 12-string bass I had just ordered. When the bass arrived, one of [the pieces] became \"Jeremy\"...I had an idea for the outro when we were recording it the second time...I overdubbed a twelve-string bass, and we added a cello. That was big-time production, for us....Rick [Parashar]\u2019s a supertalented engineer-musician...Stone [Gossard, Pearl Jam\u2019s rhythm guitarist] was sick one day, and Ed, Rick and I conjured up the art piece that opens and closes the song. That was so fun\u2014I wanted to make a whole record like that.\nIn another interview, Ament stated:\nWe knew it was a good song, but it was tough getting it to feel right\u2014for the chorus to sit back and the outro to push over the top. The tune went from practically not making it on the record to being one of the best takes. I'm not sure if it's the best song on the album but I think it's the best take. On \"Jeremy\" I always heard this other melody in the choruses and the end, and it never sounded good on guitar or bass. So we brought in a cello player which inspired a background vocal, and those things made the song really happen. Most of the time if something doesn't work right away, I just say fuck it\u2014but this was an instance when perseverance paid off.\n\"Jeremy\" is based on two different true stories. The song takes its main inspiration from a newspaper article about a 15-year-old boy named Jeremy Wade Delle from Richardson, Texas, who shot himself in front of his teacher and his second period English class of 30 students on the morning of January 8, 1991. In a 2009 interview, Vedder said that he felt \"the need to take that small article and make something of it\u2014to give that action, to give it reaction, to give it more importance.\"\nDelle was described by schoolmates as \"real quiet\" and known for \"acting sad\". After coming into class late that morning, Delle was told to get an admittance slip from the school office. He left the classroom, and returned with a .357 Magnum revolver. Delle walked to the front of the classroom, announced \"Miss, I got what I really went for\", put the barrel of the firearm in his mouth, and pulled the trigger before his teacher or classmates could react. Lisa Moore, a schoolmate, knew Jeremy from the in-school suspension program: \"He and I would pass notes back and forth and he would talk about life and stuff,\" she said. \"He signed all of his notes, 'Write back.' But on Monday he wrote, 'Later days.' I didn't know what to make of it. But I never thought this would happen.\"\nWhen asked about the song, Vedder explained:\nIt came from a small paragraph in a paper which means you kill yourself and you make a big old sacrifice and try to get your revenge. That all you're gonna end up with is a paragraph in a newspaper. Sixty-four degrees and cloudy in a suburban neighborhood. That's the beginning of the video and that's the same thing in the end; it does nothing \u2026 nothing changes. The world goes on and you're gone. The best revenge"

It was released as their sixth single and the first from the band's third studio album, The Number of the Beast (1982). It is their first single with Bruce Dickinson as vocalist. Credited solely to the band's bassist, Steve Harris, Dickinson contributed to the song but could not be credited due to a contractual agreement with his former band Sansom. Run to the Hills remains one of the band's most popular songs, with VH1 ranking it No. 27 on their list of the 40 Greatest Metal Songs and No. 14 on their list of the Greatest Hard Rock Songs.\nA live version of the song, from Live After Death, was released in 1985 and the original single was reissued in 2002, with all income donated to former drummer Clive Burr's MS Trust Fund. In 1990, as part of The First Ten Years box set, both the original and the 1985 live single were reissued on CD and 12\" vinyl, combined with \"The Number of the Beast\" and \"Running Free (live)\" respectively.\nDue to contractual issues with his previous band, Samson, Dickinson could not be credited for any of his contributions made during the writing of The Number of the Beast. Although bassist Steve Harris alone receives credit for the song, Dickinson states that he made a \"moral contribution\" to the song, in addition to \"Children of the Damned\" and \"The Prisoner\" from the same album. While speaking at the IBM Smarter Business conference in Stockholm on 10 October 2012, Dickinson revealed that parts of the song are based on the \"rising sixth\" interval within a scale, inspired by a documentary he watched which explored why \"My Way\" was one of the most popular recorded songs.\nThe song documents the colonization of the Americas, first by Europeans and then by Americans, from the perspective of a Cree Indian and American cavalryman. The opening verse is from the perspective of the Cree, describing his troubles as the European Americans \"came across the sea\", bringing the Cree \"pain and misery\". The song is written from both perspectives, The second verse is from the perspective of a U.S. cavalry soldier, describing his involvement in the American Indian Wars, \"chasing the redskins back to their holes\". The third verse is not from the perspective of any single individual, and harshly condemns the effects of American expansionism on Native Americans, resulting in the \"[Americans] raping the women and wasting the men\", and \"enslaving the young and destroying the old\".\nThe song was released as a single on 12 February 1982; more than 5 weeks prior to the album's release on 22 March 1982. The single marked Iron Maiden's debut release with new vocalist Bruce Dickinson. \"Total Eclipse\" was selected as the single's B-side over the song \"Gangland\", which in turn would appear on the initial version of the album. The band later regretted this decision, with Steve Harris commenting, \"We chose the wrong track as the B-side. I think if \"Total Eclipse\" had been on the album instead of \"Gangland\", it would have been far better.\" The song was added to The Number of the Beast album when it was remastered in 1998, and was also included in the original Japanese version.\nIt is the second of three single covers featuring Derek Riggs' depiction of Satan, which debuted on \"Purgatory\" and later appeared on \"The Number of the Beast\" covers. According to Riggs, the idea behind the original \"Run to the Hills\" cover was based around the idea of a \"power struggle in hell\", in which the band's mascot, Eddie, battles Satan with a tomahawk (referencing the song's subject matter).\nAs of 2017 the single has sold more than 200,000 copies in UK and has been certified Silver by BPI, the first to do so.\nIn 1985, a live version of \"Run to the Hills\", taken from Live After Death, was released as the band's thirteenth single, along with live versions of \"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\" as its B-sides. According to Riggs, he was asked to paint a cover illustration for both \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Phantom of"

It was released on February 27, 1990, as the lead single from their debut studio album, Wilson Phillips (1990). The single topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for a week in June 1990 and was the most successful single of that year in the US. The song won the Billboard Music Award for Hot 100 Single of the Year for 1990. At the Grammy Awards of 1991, \"Hold On\" received a nomination for Song of the Year, losing to \"From a Distance\" by Julie Gold and performed by Bette Midler.\nIn 2017, Billboard ranked the song number 15 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time. In 2020, Cleveland.com ranked it at number 37 in their list of the best Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 song of the 1990s.\nChynna Phillips wrote the song's lyrics while battling substance abuse as well as being in a \"really bad\" relationship. She explained to Kelly Clarkson, \"I just said if I don't change my course, I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.\" Producer Glen Ballard presented the track to the group, noting it needed lyrics. Phillips based the lyrics off of the principles taught in AA, specifically the idea that things had to be taken \"one day at a time.\" The next day, Phillips returned with \"Hold On\" and sang it for the Wilsons and Ballard, who immediately loved it. \"I remember one guy I played it for said, 'That's not going to go anywhere. That's not a very good song. It's really corny,'\" Phillips recalls. \"I just remember thinking to myself, 'God, I hope he's wrong.'\"\n\"Hold On\" became Wilson Phillips' first number one single, reaching the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100 on June 9, 1990, and, despite spending only one week at number one, was ranked the top song of the year by Billboard. (This was the second and final concurrence of this to date, the first of which was \"Stranger on the Shore\" by \"Mr.\" Acker Bilk in 1962.) The song also spent a week atop the adult contemporary chart that same year. In addition, \"Hold On\" peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart; this was in large part due to a performance by the group on the legendary British music series Top of the Pops a week prior to the song's peak position.\nDespite being number one on the US year-end for 1990, the song did not appear on the 1990s decade-end chart. It does, however, appear on Billboard's 60th anniversary \"All-time chart\" at number 228, ahead of many songs that do appear on the decade-end chart.\nAlex Henderson from AllMusic felt the song is not \"remotely convincing.\" Bill Coleman from Billboard described it as an \"engaging and melodic pop confection\". In 2020, Tony L. Smith from Cleveland.com wrote, \"A decade or two ago, Wilson Phillips' inspirational anthem 'Hold On' wasn't regarded as anything more than a cheesy (maybe the cheesiest) pop song from the Nineties. But opinions change. For a generation big on nostalgia, it gets no bigger than 'Hold On,' a song that has good times written all over it.\" The Daily Vault's Christopher Thelen stated in his review of Wilson Phillips, that \"Hold On\" is \"the defining moment for the album, setting the tone for what was to come as well as letting the listener know that all they have to do is sit back and enjoy the ride.\" A reviewer from Music & Media called the song \"melodic, well crafted and extremely catchy\", and \"everything you would expect from a band madeup of daughters of rock stars.\"\nA music video was produced to promote the single, directed by English film, documentary and music video director Julien Temple. It begins with aerial shots of a mountain side. Wilson Philips sings as they sit on the side of the mountain. Later, they sing as they sit together on the beach by the ocean. The video was later published on the group's official YouTube channel in March 2009. It has amassed more than 67,2 million views as of October 2021.\nUS CD single\n\"Hold On\" (Single Fade) 3:40\n\"Hold On\" 4:35\nUS / CA 7-inch vinyl and cassette single\n\"Hold On\"\u00a0\u2013 3:30\n\"Over And Over\"\u00a0\u2013 4:40\nUK CD\n\"Hold On\" (single version) 3:42\n\"Hold On\" (album version) 4:25\n\"Over and Over\" 4:27\nWest Germany Maxi-CD\n\"Hold On\"\n\"Over and Over\"\n\"A Reason to Believe\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHarold & Kumar sing the song as a duet in the film Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle.\nThe song was featured in the finale of the 2011 film Bridesmaids, performed by the band members as themselves, bringing renewed recognition to Wilson Phillips.\nOn December 4 2011, during the eighth series of the British version of The X Factor, the"

After Spears first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. She posted a snippet of it online on March 2, 2011, prior to the album's release. \"Criminal\" was chosen as a single by a poll on her Facebook page, as Spears explained it was a way to give back to her fans. The artwork for the single was released on September 14, 2011.\n\"Criminal\" is a guitar and synth-driven mid-tempo pop ballad which incorporates a folk-style flute melody. It is considered the only ballad on Femme Fatale, and is less aggressive than the other songs of the album. \"Criminal\" is influenced by the works of ABBA and Madonna. In the song, Spears sings about being in love with a bad boy and outlaw, and pleads to her mother to not worry about their relationship. \"Criminal\" received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its organic and refreshing feel in comparison with the rest of the album. After the release of Femme Fatale, the song charted on the South Korean International chart. \"Criminal\" has also charted in major markets such as Canada, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Brazil and the United States.\nThe accompanying music video for the song was filmed at Dalston and Stoke Newington, London. It features Spears as a woman in upper society and follows her relationship with a criminal, played by her then real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick. Prior to its release, London officials criticized Spears for shooting scenes with a replica gun and glamorizing violence. The video received a positive response from critics, with some calling it the best music video from Femme Fatale. Reviewers also perceived parallels between the video and Spears's personal life.\nA revival in interest for the song occurred when it went viral on TikTok, particularly with the \u201cMugshot Challenge\u201d. It has since become Spears' fourth most liked music video on YouTube; and in October 2020, the single reached a new peak of daily listeners on Spotify with 128,000 streams occurring on October 2.\n\"Criminal\" was written in 2008 by Max Martin, Shellback and Tiffany Amber, and was produced by Martin and Shellback. Spears told MTV News that after she first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears spoke about Martin's productions on Femme Fatale, saying, \"Max played a huge role on this album and he has been there since the beginning so there is such a huge level of trust. He gets exactly what I am saying when I tell him what I want and don\u2019t want musically\". Spears recorded her vocals at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The track was later mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It was registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title \"In Love With a Criminal\". On March 2, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 17-second clip of the song, describing it as \"one of [her] favorites\".\nOn August 5, 2011, she launched a poll on her Facebook page asking fans whether her next single should be \"Criminal\", \"Inside Out\" or \"(Drop Dead) Beautiful.\" After the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, she revealed to MTV News that \"Criminal\" was chosen as the fourth single. On the British talk show This Morning, Spears explained that the song \"was chosen by the fans. It was just cool to give something back to them and see what they would appreciate.\" The \"Criminal (Radio Mix)\", which was included on her second remix album, B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2, was released as a single on September 30, 2011 and the song was added to the United States mainstream radio playlists on October 4, 2011. The artwork for the single was released on September 14, 2011. It features Spears looking out into the distance, with her wavy hair falling on her bare back. A mysterious hooded man is also featured on the cover. Robbie Daw of Idolator said that \"it appears as if Camp Spears hired the best Photoshop expert $15 could buy when it came to designing the art. Oh, just kidding \u2014 we love red and blue! Makes us think of sex and, uh, ice-cold criminals.

The single reached number one in Scotland, which was Scherzinger's first solo number one worldwide.\nIn 2007, Scherzinger was planning to launch her debut album under the title Her Name is Nicole, however, the release of four singles, including \"Whatever U Like\" (featuring T.I.) and \"Baby Love\" (featuring will.i.am) all failed to significantly impact on US charts. \"Baby Love\" was moderately successful reaching top-twenty in Europe. After a number of pushbacks, the entire project was scrapped at the request of Scherzinger. In May 2010, Rap-Up reported that Scherzinger was relaunching her solo career with an \"empowering\" ballad called \"Nobody Can Change Me\". The song was recorded in a nighttime studio session while she was competing on season 10 of the U.S. reality competition, Dancing with the Stars, and was mastered on May 23, 2010, ready for its premiere on Ryan Seacrest's KIIS FM radio show the following day. Idolator was unimpressed with the \"treacly pop tune\" saying that the lack of sexiness, \"uninspiring message\" and \"squeaky vocals\" did Scherzinger no favors. However, Amos Barshad of New York magazine actually liked the song, stating that \"there\u2019s none of the Pussycat Doll\u2019s forced sexiness here; instead, it sounds like something that could have just missed the final cut on a Kelly Clarkson album (that is sort of supposed to be a compliment, yeah).\"\nThen in August 2010, Moroccan producer RedOne was interviewed by the BBC. In the interview, he revealed he had been working on Scherzinger's album. \"I just finished her album. Her last one never came out because it was collecting hamburgers, like fast food.

It was written by Scherzinger, Bilal Hajji, Kinda Hamid, Novel Jannusi, Achraf Jannusi, RedOne in the musical key of A-minor.

A reviewer from Rap-Up spoke of the song's overall theme. \"The lead Pussycat Doll has thoughts of using a deadly elixir on the dance floor, singing through a fuzzy filter over bombastic synthesizers.\" They described the song as a \"toxic pop gem\".

It was issued as a single on 23 March 1987 ahead of the record's release. The recording was solely written by Bowie, while production was handled by him along with David Richards. An R&B track, \"Day-In Day-Out\" criticizes the treatment of the homeless in the United States at that time, and deals with the depths to which a young mother sinks to feed her child.\nAn accompanying music video for the single was shot in 1987, being banned by some stations as a result of its content, although it was still nominated for a 1987 MTV Video Music award in the category of \"Best Male Video\". Commercially, \"Day-In Day-Out\" was the most successful single from Never Let Me Down, peaking at number 17 in the United Kingdom as well as charting within the top 40 in several other countries.\nA re-engineered version of the song that includes Bowie's original vocals, some original and new instrumentation, and new mastering was released in 2018 as part of the album Never Let Me Down 2018, part of the Loving the Alien (1983\u20131988) box set.\n\"Day-In Day-Out\" was written by Bowie at his home in Montreux, Switzerland, along with most of the rest of Never Let Me Down in mid-1986. It was recorded in the autumn of 1986 at Mountain Studios in the same city. The singer penned the song out of concern for the treatment of the homeless in the United States, a foray into social commentary that he would further pursue with his grunge-precursor band Tin Machine two years later.\nMusically, the recording is an R&B song, being reminiscent of some of the singer's R&B work in the 1970s. One author said that it is \"an example of Bowie's strength in the R&B genre.\" The lyrics of the song were compared by one writer to those of Dolly Parton's \"9 to 5\" (1980), and deal with the depths a young mother has to sink to feed her child. Bowie claimed the song was selected as the lead-off single for Never Let Me Down \"more as a statement of energy\" about the album, as opposed to directly trying for a chart-topping single. It was released on 23 March 1987 by EMI on multiple 7\" and 12\" single formats, featuring B-side single \"Julie\". A video EP was also distributed that year. The single was further added to several compilations, including Bowie: The Singles 1969\u20131993 (1993), The Singles Collection (1993), Bowie \u2013 The Video Collection (1993), Best of Bowie (2002), The Platinum Collection (2005) and The Best of David Bowie 1980\u20131987 (2007).\nA Spanish-language version of \"Day-In-Day-Out\", known as \"Al Alba\" or \"Dia Tras Dia\", was recorded in 1987 in order to boost interest in Bowie's first-ever concerts in Spain as part of his Glass Spider Tour (1987). It earned a single airing on Spanish radio prior to the concerts and was never released as a stand-alone single, although it was made available for digital download in 2007.\n\"Day-In Day-Out\" was performed live during the Glass Spider Tour (1987), and was included on the concert video release Glass Spider (1988).\nRe-recorded and re-mastered versions of \"Day-In Day-Out\" appears in the box set Loving the Alien (1983\u20131988) (2018). For the re-recorded version of the song, album engineer Mario J. McNulty discovered from the original master tapes that Bowie had recorded the Borneo Horns (Stanley Harrison, Lenny Pickett, Steve Elson and Arif Mardin) playing live for the song, but had elected to replace them with synthesized horns. McNulty restored the live horns in the new version, saying that the track now had \"one foot in the past and another in the present\".\nUpon release, \"Day-In Day-Out\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Complaints about poor studio production were common, although publications did find the song to be \"fun\" and \"danceable\". Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg called the track \"frustrating\", for on one hand being \"a pretty fine song\", but on the other, \"[encapsulating] everything that's initially promising but ultimately infuriating\" about the album. He concluded, \"Somewhere in there is a concerted attempt to reclaim Bowie's former territory of guitar-based rock'n'roll, but 'Day-In Day-Out' suffers badly from over-elaboration: it's a slab of 1980s soft-rock which now [in 2016] sounds incredibly"

It was released on October 16, 2008 in Japan as the lead single from the album. The song was written by Remee and Thomas Troelsen, while production was handled by Henrik Jonback. The song was BoA's first attempt into the Western market, particularly North America. Musically, the track was described as an electronic dance song with elements of R&B.\nUpon its release, \"Eat You Up\" garnered positive reviews from music critics. Many critics commended the song's electronic and dance-infused composition, and praised the song's commercial appeals; they also felt it was a choice to release through Western markets, and felt BoA's English skills had improved. It was successful on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, peaking at number eight and staying in the chart for 12 consecutive weeks.\nTwo music videos were created for the single; the first had BoA dancing in ballet recital with back-up dancers, whilst the second has her dancing in a utopian-inspired planet. BoA performed the single during several of her concerts, including her Nowness and Who's Back? concert tours. Since its release, the song has received several recognitions and has been listed on several best lists by Eastern and Western publications. \"Eat You Up\" is one of the first songs by a Korean artist to be produced and written by Western producers, and is recognized as a key factor to the Korean Wave movement.\nIn January 2008, publications in South Korea reported that BoA was planning on her North American debut. However, the head of BoA's label SM Entertainment, Lee Soo Man, denied the claims, saying that BoA was continuing work in Asian markets. South Korean publications started to surface once again about her North American debut, after SM Entertainment announced their US subsidiary label. On September 2, 2008, SM Entertainment officially announced BoA's North American debut under their subsidiary label. Ten days later, a press conference was held at the Seoul Imperial Palace Hotel to further clarify her plans. During her press conference, SM Entertainment announced that a song entitled \"Eat You Up\" was chosen as her debut English single. \"Eat You Up\" was first released on Japanese radio stations Tokyo-FM and JFN 38 Station on October 16. It was originally set for release on October 14, 2008 in the US, but was then pushed back to October 21, 2008.\n\"Eat You Up\" was written by Remee and Thomas Troelsen, while production was handled by Henrik Jonback. It was programmed and contained background vocals by Troelsen, while mixing was handled by Anders Hvenare. Musically, the track was described as an electronic dance song with elements of R&B and pop music. Victoria Goldenberg from Purple Sky Magazine noted the song's \"combination of grimy rhythms and staccato singing with the most melodic development of any track on the album.\" The majority of the song's composition, including the use of synthesizers and keyboards, have been processed through a reverse filter. The use of drum machines was overlapped after the reverse filter was used on the demo version, and was mixed after its completion.\n\"Eat You Up\" received positive reviews from most music critics. Patrick Sullivan from AllMusic was positive in his review, labelling it a \"catchily electro\" song; Sullivan highlighted the song as an album stand out track, while David Hickey from the same publication selected the song as one of BoA's best career moments. Staff members from Idolator listed the song's parent album on their \"13 Great Pop Albums That Were Overlooked and Underrated In Their Time\" list. Reviewing the album, Bradley Stern highlighted the song as one of the best tracks and stated that the material \"deserves so, so much more than the dust it was dealt.\" Victoria Goldenberg from Purple Sky Magazine selected the song as the album's best track. A staff member from CD Journal was positive in their review; They commended the commercial appeal for its North American release, and praised the mixture of R&B and electronic music musical elements.\nA reviewer from Selective Hearing was positive in his review. They praised the production and BoA's English pronunciation, stating \"The production as a whole has a bit of en edge to it which is a slight departure from the typical BoA song but it"

Both the show's judges and studio audiences gave her a standing ovation, with the media later praising her energy, choreography and live vocals.\nAn accompanying music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, sees Scherzinger take on the role of a female superhero and switches between a good-girl and bad-girl persona. It was noted for its similarities to another Kahn-directed video, \"Toxic\" by Britney Spears. \"Poison\" peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart becoming Scherzinger's second most successful single as a solo artist, in addition to peaking at number seven in Ireland, where it also became one of her highest-charting releases. The single reached number one in Scotland, which was Scherzinger's first solo number one worldwide.\nIn 2007, Scherzinger was planning to launch her debut album under the title Her Name is Nicole, however, the release of four singles, including \"Whatever U Like\" (featuring T.I.) and \"Baby Love\" (featuring will.i.am) all failed to significantly impact on US charts. \"Baby Love\" was moderately successful reaching top-twenty in Europe. After a number of pushbacks, the entire project was scrapped at the request of Scherzinger. In May 2010, Rap-Up reported that Scherzinger was relaunching her solo career with an \"empowering\" ballad called \"Nobody Can Change Me\". The song was recorded in a nighttime studio session while she was competing on season 10 of the U.S. reality competition, Dancing with the Stars, and was mastered on May 23, 2010, ready for its premiere on Ryan Seacrest's KIIS FM radio show the following day. Idolator was unimpressed with the \"treacly pop tune\" saying that the lack of sexiness, \"uninspiring message\" and \"squeaky vocals\" did Scherzinger no favors. However, Amos Barshad of New York magazine actually liked the song, stating that \"there\u2019s none of the Pussycat Doll\u2019s forced sexiness here; instead, it sounds like something that could have just missed the final cut on a Kelly Clarkson album (that is sort of supposed to be a compliment, yeah).\"\nThen in August 2010, Moroccan producer RedOne was interviewed by the BBC. In the interview, he revealed he had been working on Scherzinger's album. \"I just finished her album. Her last one never came out because it was collecting hamburgers, like fast food. One from McDonald's, one from Burger King, and so on. It tasted good, but it wasn't consistent. Her new record\u00a0\u2013 people are really going to go crazy about it because it's the real her.\" Scherzinger's boyfriend Lewis Hamilton selected \"Poison\" as the album's first single. It debuted on her official YouTube account on October 14, 2010.\n\"Poison\" is an uptempo dance-pop song produced by RedOne, BeatGeek and Jimmy Joker. It was written by Scherzinger, Bilal Hajji, Kinda Hamid, Novel Jannusi, Achraf Jannusi, RedOne in the musical key of A-minor. With a guitar-driven melody, \"Poison\" uses a pulsating and toxic beat throughout, which is similar to that used in the Britney Spears song, \"Toxic\". The lyrics were also compared to \"Toxic\" and said to have similar themes, according to BBC Music blogger, Fraser McAlpine. A reviewer from Rap-Up spoke of the song's overall theme. \"The lead Pussycat Doll has thoughts of using a deadly elixir on the dance floor, singing through a fuzzy filter over bombastic synthesizers.\" They described the song as a \"toxic pop gem\".  According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song has a time signature set in common time, with a tempo of 124\u00a0beats per minute. The melody is mainly composed with piano and guitar instruments.\nBridget Daley of Hollyscoop was"

Backed by John Lennon's \"I Am the Walrus\", it was issued as a non-album single in November 1967, the group's first release since the death of their manager, Brian Epstein. The single was commercially successful around the world, topping charts in the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and several other countries.\nMcCartney later said that the lyrics take duality as their theme. The song originated when, in response to a question from Beatles aide Alistair Taylor about songwriting, McCartney sat down at a harmonium and asked Taylor to say the opposite of whatever he said. The completed song includes a musical coda, which was improvised by the Beatles when they were recording the track in October 1967. Unimpressed with the composition, Lennon pushed for \"I Am the Walrus\" to be the single's A-side, before reluctantly accepting that \"Hello, Goodbye\" was the more commercial-sounding of the two sides. The Beatles produced three promotional films for the song, one of which was shown on The Ed Sullivan Show in America. Due to the regulations against lip-syncing on British television, none of the clips were aired there.\n\"Hello, Goodbye\" has traditionally received a varied response from music critics. While some reviewers praise the song for its classic pop qualities, others deem it unadventurous by the Beatles' standards, and inconsequential. The track was included on the expanded US release of the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack EP, and later appeared on compilation albums such as 1967\u20131970 and 1. McCartney has often performed \"Hello, Goodbye\" in concert, beginning with his Driving World Tour in 2002. James Last, Bud Shank, Allen Toussaint, the Cure and the cast of Glee are among the acts who have also recorded the song.\nAlthough \"Hello, Goodbye\" is credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney, the song was written solely by Paul McCartney. The composition came about through an exercise in word association between McCartney and Alistair Taylor, an assistant of the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein. It originated during a period when, following the completion of their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in April 1967, the Beatles typically embraced randomness and simplicity as part of the creative process.\nAccording to Taylor's recollection, he was visiting McCartney at his home in St John's Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor into the dining room, where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the instrument and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: \"And so it went \u2013 black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye.\" Taylor later reflected: \"I've no memory at all of the tune\u00a0... I wonder whether Paul really made up [the melody to] that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already.\"\nTalking in the 1990s to his official biographer, Barry Miles, McCartney said that the lyrics address duality, reflecting his astrological sign of Gemini. He added: \"It's such a deep theme in the universe, duality \u2013 man woman, black white, ebony ivory, high low, right wrong, up down, hello goodbye \u2013 that it was a very easy song to write.\" McCartney also said that, in \"Hello, Goodbye\", he was promoting \"the more positive side of the duality\".\nAmong Beatles biographers, Ian MacDonald dates the composition to late September 1967, while Bob Spitz says it was written in time for the Our World international television broadcast, in June that year. According to Spitz, McCartney suggested \"Hello, Goodbye\" as the Beatles' contribution to Our World, an honour that instead went to the John Lennon-composed \"All You Need Is Love\".\n\"Hello, Goodbye\" is in the key of C major and in 4/4 time. MacDonald describes the musical structure as \"characteristically scalar\" and founded on \"a descending sequence in C\", with \"a brief touchdown on A flat as its only surprise\". Musicologist Walter Everett writes that the bassline in the chorus is an inverted form of the descending scale, which is accentuated on the Beatles' recording by the lead guitar part.\nIn Everett's estimation, much of \"Hello, Goodbye\" references previous Lennon\u2013McCartney compositions: over the verses, the parallel thirds in the vocal recall the band's"

It was released on 15 April 1983 as the third single from their third studio album of the same name. The song was written by band member Gary Kemp.\nThe song was a worldwide hit, peaking at number one in the UK Singles Chart on 30 April 1983 for four weeks, becoming the sixth-biggest-selling single of the year, and reaching the top ten in the weekly charts of many other countries. It is Spandau Ballet's biggest hit and their only top ten hit in the U.S., reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100 in the autumn of 1983 and topping the adult contemporary chart for one week. In 2011, it received a BMI award as one of the most played songs in US history with four million airplays.\n\"True\" was composed by group leader Gary Kemp, who wrote the song at his parents' house while living there. It is a six-minute (in its original album version) song that in part pays tribute to the Motown artist Marvin Gaye, who is mentioned in the lyrics, and the sound he helped to establish. According to Kemp, \"I think I wanted to write a song that was a bit like a Marvin Gaye, Al Green song, a blue-eyed soul song. It was at a time when it was me concentrating on melody first rather than the sort of riff and the groove.\" Kemp also said, \"'True' became a song about writing a love song. Why 'Why do I find it hard to write the next line? I want the truth to be said?' Because I didn't want to write it down\u2014because there's nothing more embarrassing.\"\nThe song was partly about Kemp's platonic relationship (and unrequited love) with Altered Images singer Clare Grogan. Some phrases in the lyrics (including the much-quoted reference to \"seaside arms\") were adapted from Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita, a copy of which Grogan had given Kemp. The song is written in the key of G major. It has a tempo of 98 BPM and a chord progression of G, Em9, CMaj9, Bm7. The song modulates to the key of E\u266d major for the instrumental break, after which it re-modulates the key of G Major for the remainder of the song.\nA notable omission of the recording is that Spandau Ballet bassist Martin Kemp did not perform on the track; a bass synthesiser was used instead. However, Martin Kemp appeared in the music video appearing to play guitar, while the band's guitarist, songwriter Gary Kemp, sat at a piano. Martin Kemp would play bass on the song in future live performances.\nIn 2009, Tim Rice wrote in The Spectator that the song was \"a giant of its time and remains a standard today\". In 2014, Ian Gittins described it in The Guardian as a \"juggernaut power ballad\". In 2015, Peter Larsen wrote for the Orange County Register that the band's formula of mining \"a vein of soulfulness tinged with nostalgia and romance\" had \"reached perfection\" on the track, describing it as \"the one Spandau Ballet song everyone knows... It's truly a perfect song, as moving today as ever it was.\" It has been characterised as a \"karaoke staple\". In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as the nation's tenth-favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV.\nOn the other hand, Guardian journalist Luke Williams referred to the song as \"the biggest load of musical tosh ever\"; his colleague Michael Hann described it as \"dreadful wine-bar soul\". Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times named \"True\" the worst song of all time, while Seattle Post-Intelligencer columnist Robert Jamieson selected it as the worst ever love song. It was also featured in the Houston Press article, \"10 Songs We Never, Ever Want to Hear Again, Ever\". Luke Williams derided the lyric, \"Why do I find it hard to write the next line?\", and NME included the line, \"I bought a ticket to the world but now I've come back again\", in their \"50 worst pop lyrics of all time\".\nIn 2014, the band's singer, Tony Hadley, commented on the song and its lyrics:\nI don't think \"True\" is Spandau's best song\u2014for me, \"Through the Barricades\" is. But \"True\" had some connection, and I really don't know why. It's not a specific lyric, is it? \"Head over heels when toe to toe\"\u2014sometimes you'd be like, \"Right, Gary, what's this about, mate?\" Is it \"I'm head over heels in love?\" \"Am I in bed because our feet are touching?\" I don't know. But then, I suppose, we grew up on David Bowie and Roxy Music. \"Virginia Plain\"\u2014what's that about? Half of the Bowie songs, I couldn't tell you what they're about."

It was released on October 16, 2001, as the lead single from their third studio album, Weathered. The song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of February 9, 2002, and reached number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for nine consecutive weeks, beginning in December 2001. Worldwide, the song was a top-20 hit in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 2003 at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards.\nScott Stapp recalls the writing process of \"My Sacrifice\" in a 2019 interview with Kerrang.\n\"From what I remember, writing it happened the way things usually happened when we wrote together \u2013 Mark's got an acoustic guitar and I've got some lyrics I've begun, or we're just freestyling and something comes out. A melody or a line or a lyric comes out and we start playing off each other and discussing, 'Let's go here, let's go there, let's do this' and then I would step away from that session and go bury myself into the lyric writing. And then I'd get back together with him and we would develop the song even more. It all came together in a very symbiotic way \u2013 like 90 per cent of the songs came during our writing relationship did.\" \u2014 Stapp\nAccording to Stapp both Tremonti and himself knew that they had written something special that would connect with people and that Creed fans at the time would appreciate it and like it, however they did not know it would go on to become so successful and \"stand the test of time.\" During the recording sessions of Weathered at the J. Stanley Productions Inc. recording studio in Ocoee, Florida, Jay Stanley recalls his initial impression of hearing \"My Sacrifice\" while working with the band stating that he knew the song was going to be huge the first time he heard it.\nStapp stated that the meaning of the song lyrics were about his own personal struggles with battling substance abuse, addiction and alcoholism and failing despite his best efforts, and him coming to terms with his inability to stay on the straight and narrow.\nStapp also explains that the song is about coming out of a dark place or period in your life and reconnecting with yourself. He notes several of the songs lyrical themes represented through elements in the music video. These include a shot of himself in a rowboat where he is seen pulling a drowning version of himself out of the water onto the boat, which represents periods of his life where he would claim sobriety, coming out from the darkness and finding temporary clarity, only to fall back into his old habits. He also mentions that the shots of other people in the video are representative of the feelings you have when you are with someone you love.\nThe music video, directed by David Meyers, was the first video over which Creed had complete creative control. Parts of the music video were filmed just off Interstate 4's exit 48 for County Road 557 in Polk County, Florida. The rest of the video was filmed at Universal Studios Florida theme park. The New York-styled street outside the former Kongfrontation ride was filled with water for the video. The production of the video was the subject of an episode of MTV's Making the Video.\nThe video begins in a park with an old, seemingly blind man, portrayed by actor Herbert Maynard, feeding pigeons before the camera pans into his mind, showing flashbacks of a flooding city, where members of the band perform, while Scott Stapp sings in a rowboat.  Stapp passes by many people, including a woman seen rising from under the water reaching out to him, portrayed by actress Dawn Cairns who also appears in the music video for \"One Last Breath\", before seeing a fist jump out of the water at him.  He rescues the person, realizing that it is actually him, relating to the song's theme of reunion within oneself and believing. During the bridge, the band performs in a school bus illuminated by candles, followed by Stapp in a diner while a young boy, portrayed by actor Kellen Foruria, hides from a storm. After a baby carriage slams into the diner window, the harsh weather seen throughout the video dies down to a peaceful, sunny setting and the boy goes to hug the older Scott, but loses his eyesight.  By contrast, the older man at the start of the video regains his, revealing that both the young boy and the old man are Stapp at different points in his life.\nReleased as the lead single to the bands third studio"

The song was written by Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Mark Hudson.  It was released in 1993 as the first single from the band's commercially successful album Get a Grip.  The single reached number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, number three on the Cash Box Top 100, and number one on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart, where it remained for nine weeks, making it Aerosmith's most successful single on that chart. In the UK, the song peaked at number 19 on the British pop chart in April 1993.\nAccording to the band's autobiography Walk This Way, the song was inspired by the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Steven Tyler also mentions in the book that the song features the sound of a bass drum he stole from his high school; four loud beats are heard from that drum in a pause between the final verse and chorus.\nThe music video depicts vandalism, grand theft auto, joyriding, airbag crashing, unprotected sex, violence among school-aged youth, cross-dressing teachers, a naked Steven Tyler holding a zipper by his crotch with half his body painted black (to give the effect he pulled down a zipper, unzipping his body) and lead guitarist Joe Perry playing a lead guitar solo in front of an oncoming train. The train scene was filmed on Lake Britton Bridge in Shasta County, California, the same bridge where Stand by Me filmed their famous train scene and employs the same Introvision technology. Directed by Marty Callner, the video featured actor Edward Furlong.\nReleased on YouTube on 24 December 2009, the video has received over 66 million views as of May 2021.\n\"Livin' on the Edge\" has been a staple at Aerosmith concerts ever since its release.\nDuring the Get a Grip Tour, the band performed a portion of \"She Cried\" (a song recorded by Jay and the Americans, among other artists) as the intro to \"Livin' on the Edge\". Performances often involved Tyler screaming \"There ain't no life nowhere\" (from the song \"I Don't Live Today\" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience) and then breathing heavily over a bright light during the brief interlude.\n\"Livin' on the Edge\" was performed at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards, the 36th Grammy Awards, and at Woodstock '94.\nAdditionally, the band performed the song as part of its set at the United We Stand benefit concert, held in Washington, D.C. shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\"Livin' on the Edge\" met with dismissive reactions from music critics. Reviewing Get a Grip for Rolling Stone, Mark Coleman cited \"Livin' on the Edge\" as an example of the album \"playing it safe according to strict late-Eighties directives\", and added that it \"ascends into a soaring, Bon Jovi-esque power chorale; only the gritty guitars on the bridge keep the damn thing grounded.\" David Browne of Entertainment Weekly also found the song was uncomfortably derivative of Bon Jovi, remarking that it \"might have worked better if it didn\u2019t sound like Bon Jovi trying hard to sound like Aerosmith.\" Both Browne and Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the song's lyrics as a halfhearted, ineffectual attempt at social commentary.\nThe song won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal for the year 1993. The video for the song earned the band a Viewer's Choice award at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards. The video was also voted \"Best Video\" by Metal Edge readers in the magazine's 1993 Readers' Choice Awards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitburn, Joel (2004).

Released as the first single from the group's seventh studio album Super Trouper, it is a ballad in the key of G-flat major, reflecting on the end of a relationship. The single's B-side was the non-album track \"Elaine\". The song peaked at No.1 in several countries, including the UK, where it became their eighth chart-topper. It was also the group's final top 10 hit in the United States. It was written by Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, with Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog singing the lead vocal.\nUlvaeus and Andersson started writing \"The Winner Takes It All\" in the summer of 1979 in a cottage on the island of Viggs\u00f6. According to Andersson, the idea for the song suddenly came up \"from old ideas, from old small musical pieces\" they had.  The demo had an original title of \"The Story of My Life\" and the first arrangement for the song was uptempo with a constant beat. However, they felt their first effort \"much too stiff and metrical\", so they left the song for a few days while they worked on other songs.  Four days later they returned to the song, and Andersson came up the idea of using a French chanson-stye arrangement with a descending piano line and a looser structure. Ulvaeus then recorded a demo using nonsense French words for lyrics, and took the recording home to write the lyrics for \"The Winner Takes It All\". According to Ulvaeus, he drank whiskey while he was writing, and it was the quickest lyrics he ever wrote. He said, \"I was drunk, and the whole lyric came to me in a rush of emotion in one hour.\" Ulvaeus said that when he gave the lyrics to F\u00e4ltskog to read, \"a tear or two welled up in her eyes. Because the words really affected her.\"\nUlvaeus denies the song is about his and F\u00e4ltskog's divorce, saying the basis of the song \"is the experience of a divorce, but it's fiction. 'Cause one thing I can say is that there wasn't a winner or a loser in our case. A lot of people think it's straight out of reality, but it's not\". However, Ulvaeus admitted that the heartache of their breakup inspired the song, but noted that the words in the song should not be taken literally. He said: \"Neither Agnetha nor I were winners in our divorce.\" American critic Chuck Klosterman, who says \"The Winner Takes It All\" is \"[the only] pop song that examines the self-aware guilt one feels when talking to a person who has humanely obliterated your heart\" finds Ulvaeus' denial hard to believe in light of the original title. And the booklet for the double CD compilation The Definitive Collection states \"'The Winner Takes It All' is the song where Bjorn admits that the sad experience of his and Agnetha's divorce the previous year left its mark on the lyrics.\"\nF\u00e4ltskog has also repeatedly stated that though \"The Winner Takes It All\" is her favourite ABBA song and that it has an excellent set of lyrics, the story is not that of her and Ulvaeus: there were no winners in their divorce, especially as children were involved.\nIn a 1999 poll for Channel 5, \"The Winner Takes It All\" was voted Britain's favourite ABBA song. This feat was replicated in a 2010 poll for ITV. In a 2006 poll for a Channel Five programme, \"The Winner Takes It All\" was voted \"Britain's Favourite Break-Up Song.\"\nA music video to promote the song was filmed in July 1980 on Marstrand, an island on the Swedish west coast. It was directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m.  The video was shot ten days after the divorce of Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog was officially declared by the courts. It starts with a black-and-white photo montage of ABBA, then moves to the face of Agnetha singing the song. Interspersed in the video are footages of her walking alone and other happier members of the band.\n\"The Winner Takes It All\" was a major success for ABBA, hitting No. 1 in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, South Africa and the United Kingdom. It reached the Top 5 in Austria, Finland, France, West Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Zimbabwe, while peaking in the Top 10 in Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain and the United States (where it became ABBA's fourth and final American Top 10 hit, peaking at No. 8; the song spent 26 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, more than any other ABBA single). It was also the group's second Billboard Adult Contemporary #1 (after \"Fernando\"). \"The Winner Takes It All\" was also a hit in Brazil: it was included on the soundtrack of \"Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Alado\" (\"Winged Heart\"), a popular soap opera in 1980, as the main theme.\nThe track"

The B-side was \"Happy Hawaii\", an arrangement of another ABBA song, \"Why Did It Have to Be Me?\", but with a different lead vocalist and lyrics. \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" was one of the early ABBA songs to deal with the break-up of a relationship. It predates the divorces of the ABBA members as well as further break-up songs to come: \"The Winner Takes It All\", \"One of Us\" and \"When All Is Said and Done\". Group member Benny Andersson named \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" as one of ABBA's best recordings in a 2004 interview, along with \"Dancing Queen\", \"The Winner Takes It All\" and \"When I Kissed the Teacher\". \"Conoci\u00e9ndome, Conoci\u00e9ndote\" is the Spanish-language version of the song. It was included in the compilation Oro: Grandes \u00c9xitos released in 1993 and Gracias Por La M\u00fasica released in 1980.\nThe music video depicts the band against various colored backdrops singing while facing each other, turning away as a new line is sung. At the end of the video, the band's female members are seen walking away through thick snow. The video was directed by future Academy Award nominee Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and is a landmark in his career alongside most other videos of the band which were directed by him.\n\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" proved to be one of ABBA's more successful singles, hitting #1 in West Germany (ABBA's sixth consecutive chart-topper there) and the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico and South Africa, and reaching the top 3 in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. It was a top 10 hit in Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand and Norway. In the United States, it became ABBA's sixth top 20 single, peaking at #14 on the Hot 100 and reaching #7 on Billboard's AC chart.\nIn the UK, \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" was one of the biggest singles of 1977. It also began a second run of three consecutive #1 singles for ABBA (followed by \"The Name of the Game\" and \"Take a Chance on Me\"), the group having had three consecutive #1 hit singles in 1976. As of September 2021, it is the group's third-biggest song in the country with 1.02 million chart sales, made up of pure sales and streams.\nBy September 1979 in West Germany \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" had sold over 300,000 copies.\nBillboard reviewed the song and described it as a \"melodically energetic but sad worded ditty about a romantic breakup.\"\n\nAnni-Frid Lyngstad \u2013 lead vocals\nAgnetha F\u00e4ltskog - backing vocals\nBj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nBenny Andersson \u2013 keyboards, synthesizer\nRutger Gunnarsson - bass, string arrangements\n\n\n\n\nA cover recorded in 1977 by the Top of the Poppers appears on the 2002 compilation album Knowing Me, Knowing You.\nThe Paraguayan singer Perla recorded a Spanish version, Conociendonos Mas for the 1977 album Relaciones Internacionales.\nCzech singer V\u011bra \u0160pinarov\u00e1 recorded a Czech version, Slune\u010dn\u00e9 pob\u0159e\u017e\u00ed (meaning Sunny Beach in Bulgaria), in 1977.\nThe French conductor Franck Pourcel recorded an instrumental version for his 1978 album Pourcel meets Abba.\nBritish singer Cilla Black recorded a cover for her 1980 album Especially for You.\nSwedish pop group A-Teens included the song as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of their debut album The ABBA Generation.\nDanny Wilson recorded a live version of the song, which was released on their bonus album Three-In-A-Bed Romp in 1991.

It was released as the third single from his debut album, The College Dropout. The song was written and produced by West and features singer Syleena Johnson. The hip hop song contains an interpolation of \"Mystery of Iniquity\" by Lauryn Hill from her live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, therefore Hill is credited as a composer. \nIt was released in February 2004 and entered the UK Singles Chart at number ten and peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 on May 11, 2004, his first solo Top 10 hit in the USA. The song was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 47th Grammy Awards, Viewer's Choice at the 2004 BET Awards and received nominations for a total of four awards at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards.\nThe song contains an interpolation of \"Mystery of Iniquity\" by Lauryn Hill from her live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0. West originally attempted to acquire legal clearance to sample the recording but due to various complications, the permission was withheld. West then called upon Syleena Johnson to re-sing the relevant vocal portions of \"Mystery of Iniquity\" which ended up in the final track. The version of the song with the original sample can be heard on West's Freshman Adjustment mixtape. However, the earliest version of the song can be found on West's 2001 mixtape The Prerequisite, on which it called \"Dream Come True\". Lyrically, \"All Falls Down\" examines the self-consciousness and insecurity within society, particularly the black community, and how these characteristics pertain to economic materialism.\nIn a 2013 interview with The New York Times, West revealed Dead Prez's impact on the song;\n\"It wasn\u2019t until I hung out with Dead Prez and understood how to make, you know, raps with a message sound cool that I was able to just write \u201cAll Falls Down\u201d in 15 minutes.\u201d\nWest performed the song live on Def Poetry Jam in 2004 as a poem titled \"Self Conscious\". A performance of \"All Falls Down\" was included on West's 2006 live album Late Orchestration, which was recorded in 2005 at Abbey Road Studios in London. It was performed live by West in 2015 as the closer to his headlining set at Glastonbury.\nThe song was performed by West as part of a medley at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, as well on numerous television shows, including; Late Show with David Letterman, Total Request Live, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and Later... with Jools Holland.\nThe music video for \"All Falls Down\" was directed by Chris Milk and shot at Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California. It follows West as he accompanies his girlfriend, played by Stacey Dash, to the airport to catch her flight. The video is shot in first-person perspective, displaying the journey from their car to the airport terminal through West's eyes. The music video also features cameos by GLC, Consequence, Common,  Kel Mitchell, and Syleena Johnson, who features on the song, as the lady who checks Dash in at the airport reception. Complex named it the 18th best music video of the 2000s decade.\n\"All Falls Down\" is placed as the fourth song of Kanye West's debut studio album, The College Dropout. The album is notable for containing complex societal issues, which West strives to advertently cover in ways relating to the Black American community. These thematic concepts, prevalent through the entirety of the album, are omnipresent within this specific song.\nWest in \"All Falls Down\" decides to vulnerably share his own imperfections. This shines through his divulge into chronic issues with personal insecurities, which he recognizes as a problem that relates to the greater population within society than just himself. Within the concept of insecurities, West makes the decision to specifically hone in on the continuous, dividing matter of excessive materialism, or a desire of it, in attempt to pertain to an affluent appearance. While focusing on this topic, he admits that although being subject to this affair, he knowingly understands the mindset contradictory to such a lifestyle pertaining to short-term, consumerist happiness. Yet, he still finds himself to be a participant in this way of life.\nWest also ties this thematic idea to an even deeper, underlying meaning. The reason this lifestyle is endeavored is in an attempt to recompense for"

The song features vocals by singer T-Pain and was produced by West and DJ Toomp. It is a hip hop song that contains a sample of the keyboard outro to \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\" performed by Michael Jackson. The song features additional drum programming by Timbaland and additional production by Mike Dean, as well as background vocals by John Legend and Ne-Yo.\nThe song's lyrics see West celebrating the finer things in life and acknowledging his success. \"Good Life\" peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and number twenty-three on the UK Singles Chart. The music video was premiered on MTV Jams on September 11, 2007. The song earned two nominations at the 50th Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, winning the latter. It was nominated for Best Collaboration and Video of the Year at the 2008 BET Awards, managing to win the former.\nThe song samples the keyboard outro of the single \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\" performed by Michael Jackson, combined with layers of synths from Omar Edwards. Producer DJ Toomp revealed that the song's creation started off with West playing with the sample and being like: \"Yo, I always wanted to do something with this... I want to hear it in a different key\" and Toomp played with the sample as well. John Legend and Ne-Yo sing the final refrains of \"Good Life\". The lyrics focus on life being good and West celebrates his success. West spins lyrics from 50 Cent's single \"In Da Club\" that originally were about Lloyd Banks giving 50 advice to being about 50 giving West advice instead. It was revealed by T-Pain that even though he recorded multiple different hooks, none of them sounded right to West and he ended up making the hook out of a composite that was made up of all the hooks that had been recorded by T-Pain. Working on the track in the studio was viewed as feeling like a party by Toomp and he also said that there was a lot of the GOOD Music crew in the studio for it.\nIn a 2019 interview with Revolt, DJ Toomp commented on the creation of the song;\n\"Kanye came with the sample and I started making the beat around it. We wanted a professional keyboardist to bless that shit. John Legend was singing on the hook in one version. We went through about four different artists before we decided T-Pain was going to do the hook. Watching him go through so many different artists and different hooks, I learned about taking your time and not settling with what you hear the first time.\"\nThe music video for \"Good Life\" was directed by Jonas & Fran\u00e7ois with animation by So-Me. The video premiered on September 11, 2007 as MTV Jams' \"Jam of the Week\". It features West and T-Pain performing with animated backdrops on a white background and often mouthing the words of the song lyrics, which appear in large letters. The version of the song used in the video contains an additional twenty-four seconds that the album version does not have. The music video features a cameo from rapper/model LoLa Monroe. On set, West had to persuade T-Pain to listen to \"Good Life\" again before the shooting began.\n\"Good Life\" debuted at number sixty-three on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs during the chart week of September 22, 2007, where it eventually peaked at number three, becoming West's second top ten single from Graduation on the chart. For the chart week of September 29, 2007, \"Good Life\" was the \"Hot Shot Debut\" of the week on the Billboard Hot 100, as it entered at number fourteen due to strong digital downloads. The song climbed to the seventh position, becoming West's second consecutive top ten Hot 100 single from Graduation as well as T-Pain's sixth top ten single. \"Good Life\" debuted on the Canadian Hot 100 at number thirty-nine and has peaked at number twenty-three. The single generated a strong reaction from the MuchMusic Countdown, where it reached number-one. \"Good Life\" was able to reach number thirty-three on the UK Singles Chart before it was officially released in the UK until November 5, 2007. Upon its release, the single was able to rise and peak at the twenty-third position on the chart.\n\"Good Life\" received a total of 13 nominations for music awards and ultimately won eight of them. Among the awards won by the song were Best Collaboration at the 2008 BET Awards,"

The Five Stairsteps had previous peripheral success recording in Chicago with Curtis Mayfield; when Mayfield's workload precluded his continuing to work with the group they were reassigned to Stan Vincent, an in-house producer for Buddah Records, who had recently scored a Top Ten hit with the Lou Christie single \"I'm Gonna Make You Mine\". The Five Stairsteps' debut collaboration with Vincent was originally formatted with the group's rendition of \"Dear Prudence\" as the A-side with Vincent's original composition \"O-o-h Child\" as B-side. However, \"O-o-h Child\" broke out in the key markets of Philadelphia and Detroit to rise as high as #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 1970. The track's R&B chart impact was more muted with a #14 peak, although \"O-o-h Child\" is now regarded as a \"soft soul\" classic. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 21 song of 1970.\nThe Five Stairsteps' only pop Top 40 hit, \"O-o-h Child\" would be the group's last R&B top 40 hit (they had several top 40 R&B hits in the 1960s) until 1976's \"From Us to You\". Included on the band's The Stairsteps album from 1970, it has become the Stairsteps' signature song and has inspired more than twenty covers since its release. The song featured various members, including lone female member and eldest sister Alohe, brothers Keni, Dennis, James, lead singer Clarence Burke Jr. singing in various parts of the song.\nThe lyrics tell the listener that \"things are gonna get easier\" in times of strife. The song's uplifting message helped it to become popular among pop and rhythm and blues audiences when it was released.\nThe song is ranked #402 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\nAllMusic review by Joe Viglione: \"Producer Stan Vincent's Top Ten hit for the Stairsteps, \"O-o-h Child,\" was one of those bright, memorable, sterling songs which, as with Alive 'N Kickins \"Tighter, Tighter,\" made the summer of 1970 so memorable.\"\nThe Five Stairsteps\nLead vocals by Clarence Burke Jr. and James Burke\nBacking vocals by Keni Burke, Alohe Burke, and Dennis Burke\nMusicians \nGuitars by Hugh McCracken and Clarence Burke Jr.\nBass by Keni Burke\nKeyboards by Richard Tee\nDrums by Bernard Purdie\nProduction\nRecorded at Allegro Studios\nProduced, written, arranged, and conducted by Stan Vincent\n\n\n\n\nThe Spinners covered the song on their 1970 album 2nd Time Around.\nBruce Ruffin released a reggae cover of the song in 1970.\nNina Simone covered the song on her 1971 album Here Comes the Sun.\nDusty Springfield covered the song in 1971 for possible inclusion on See All Her Faces.

The second single and title track from their album Love Child, it became the Supremes' 11th (and penultimate) number-one single in the United States, where it sold 500,000 in its first week and 2 million copies by year's end.\nThe record took just three weeks to reach the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart, which it then topped for two weeks, November 30\u2014December 7, 1968, before being dethroned by an even bigger Motown single, Marvin Gaye's \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\". \"Love Child\" also performed well on the soul chart \u2014 where it spent three weeks at number two (stuck behind Johnnie Taylor's \"Who's Making Love\") \u2014 and paved new ground for a major pop hit with its then-controversial subject matter of illegitimacy. It is also the single that finally knocked the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" off the top spot in the United States after its nine-week run. The Supremes debuted the dynamic and intense song on the season premiere of the CBS variety program The Ed Sullivan Show on Sunday, September 29, 1968. In Billboard's special 2015 chart of the Top 40 Biggest Girl Groups of All Time on the Billboard Hot 100, \"Love Child\" ranked highest among the Supremes' six entries.\n\nIn 1967, Diana Ross & the Supremes dropped Florence Ballard, engaged new member Cindy Birdsong and added Ross' name to the billing. Following this string of changes, the Supremes had mixed success on the pop charts. \"Reflections\" peaked at number 2 on the Billboard pop charts and \"In and out of Love\" peaked at 9, but the group's next two singles did not make the pop top twenty.\nThis prompted Motown label chief Berry Gordy to hold a special meeting in a room at the Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit, which was attended by a team of writers and producers at the label, including R. Dean Taylor, Frank Wilson, Pam Sawyer, Deke Richards, and Henry Cosby.  The group, who named themselves The Clan, set to work on a hit single for Diana Ross & the Supremes. Instead of composing another love-based song, the team decided to craft a tune about a woman who is asking her boyfriend not to pressure her into sleeping with him, for fear they would conceive a \"love child.\" The woman, portrayed on the record by Diana Ross, is herself a love child, and, besides not having a father at home, had to endure wearing rags to school and growing up in an \"old, cold, run-down tenement slum.\" The background vocals echo this sentiment, asking the boyfriend to please \"wait/wait won't you wait now/hold on/wait/just a little bit longer.\"\nAs was nearly always the case on singles released under the \"Diana Ross & the Supremes\" name, Supremes members Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong do not perform on the record; Motown session singers The Andantes performed the background vocals.  All lead vocals were by Diana Ross, who would leave the group in a year for a solo career.\nThe public responded immediately to \"Love Child\" when it was released as a single on September 30, 1968, rising to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming the third biggest selling Supremes' single behind \"Baby Love\" and \"Someday We'll Be Together.\" The feat was repeated in Canada, where it also reached number one in the RPM 100 national singles chart. In the UK singles chart, the song peaked at number 15, and number three in Australia. \"Love Child\" became the title track of Diana Ross & the Supremes' Love Child album, released on November 13, 1968.\n7\" single (30 September 1968) (North America/United Kingdom)\n\"Love Child\" \u2013 2:59\n\"Will This Be the Day\" \u2013 2:50\n7\" single (1968) (Netherlands)\n\"Love Child\" \u2013 2:59\n\"Misery Makes Its Home in My Heart \" \u2013 2:52\nLead vocals by Diana Ross\nBackground vocals by The Andantes: Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow, and Louvain Demps\nInstrumentation by The Funk Brothers and the"

(Studio A). type: single. writer: Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland. \"Where Did Our Love Go\" is a 1964 song recorded by American music group the Supremes for the Motown label.\nWritten and produced by Motown's main production team Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland, \"Where Did Our Love Go\" was the first single by the Supremes to go to the #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart in the United States, a spot it held for two weeks, from August 16 to August 29, 1964. It was also the first of five Supremes songs in a row to reach #1 (the others being \"Baby Love\", \"Come See About Me\", \"Stop! In the Name of Love\", and \"Back in My Arms Again\"). It also reached No. 1 on the Cash Box R&B singles chart.\nThe Supremes' version is ranked #475 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry in 2016 due to its \"cultural, historic, or artistic significance.\" Billboard named the song #4 on its list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time. The BBC ranked \"Where Did Our Love Go\" at number 59 on The Top 100 Digital Motown Chart, which ranks Motown releases by their all time UK downloads and streams.\n\nAccording to Brian Holland, \"Where Did Our Love Go\" was written with The Supremes in mind. Though Supremes member Mary Wilson would later write that the song had been originally given to The Marvelettes, Holland would deny this claim, as would the Marvelettes themselves. Marvelettes member Katherine Anderson-Schnaffer later said that the song did not fit her group's repertoire because it was produced under a slower beat and their music was more uptempo. When the Supremes were eventually given the song, the group members were not pleased with the record, with member Florence Ballard later stating that they had wanted a stronger single similar to the Marvelettes' \"Please Mr. Postman\". Although the group felt the song did not have the hook to make it successful, they decided that they had no choice and prepared to record it.\nInitially, the producers argued over who should sing the song, as it had been cut in the same key as Mary Wilson's voice but, since Berry Gordy had assigned the lead singer role to Diana Ross, the producers eventually gave the song to her; she sang it in her usual high register in the recording studio on April 8. As a result, Ross was told to sing the song in a lower register and begrudgingly complied with Holland/Dozier/Holland's \"to the letter\" formula. Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard's vocal contribution was significant in bringing fresh yet smooth tones to the overall sound of the song while remaining true to the backup arrangements that Lamont Dozier had set down.\nUpon hearing the song's playback, an excited Ross rushed to Gordy's office and told him to come to the studio to listen. Upon hearing playback, a satisfied Gordy nodded, saying to the producers and the group that the song had potential to be a top ten hit.\n\"Where Did Our Love Go\" was released as a single on June 17, 1964, and entered the Hot 100 at #77. Six weeks later, while the Supremes were on tour as part of Dick Clark's \"American Bandstand Caravan of Stars\", the song made it to #1 for two weeks, spending a total of 9 weeks in the Billboard Top Ten. The girls began the tour at the bottom of the bill; by the conclusion of the tour, they were at the top. They performed the song on the NBC variety program, Hullabaloo! on Tuesday, January 26, 1965.\nThe song became the focal point and title track of the group's second album, Where Did Our Love Go, released later that year. A German language version of it titled \"Baby, Baby, wo ist unsere Liebe\" was recorded by the Supremes for German-speaking markets overseas and released as the b-side to their German recording of \"Moonlight and Kisses\" in April 1965.\nThe song struck a chord in the United States, with a group which would become the most successful chart-topping American popular music group of the 1960s.  Billboard described the song as having an \"unbeatable beat\" and a \"true rockin'-blues groove.\" The first of their American chart toppers, the song peaked just weeks after the passage of"

It was released on September 15, 1996, two days after his death, and was the third and final single from his fourth studio album All Eyez on Me. The song features contemporary soul singer Danny Boy who provided the vocals for the song's hook. The single release differs from the version found on the album, with re-recorded vocals, alternate lyrics and a live band playing the beat. The song charted well internationally, reaching number two in New Zealand, number 13 in the United Kingdom, and number 15 in the Netherlands. It was not released as a single in the United States, thus making it ineligible to chart on the Billboard singles charts (due to chart rules at the time), but reached numbers 18 and 58 in the R&B and Pop Airplay charts, respectively.\nThe track was produced by Daz Dillinger and samples the song \"A Dream\" by DeBarge. The album version of the song was recorded the same day 2Pac was released from prison, and was the second song he recorded that day, \"Ambitionz Az a Ridah\" being the first. As the song was not released as a single in the US, the lead single for 2Pac's next album , The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, was released in the US the following week, countries that received \"I Ain't Mad At Cha\" as a single release had to wait until the following month (October) for the release of his next album's single.\nThe song is a reminiscence of how time has changed from when he was younger to when he became famous. He speaks of losing touch with people and how many people turned on him after his success. Yet he still maintains that he's got \"nothing but love\" for his old friends, with the hook repeating the line \"I ain't mad at cha\".\nThe first verse speaks about how he lost touch with his friend, who converted to Islam, and the difference in lifestyles they chose to live. The second verse speaks about 2Pac being sentenced to prison. He mentions his old girlfriend and tries to comfort his mother. In the third verse (album version), 2Pac raps about how his life has changed from being in the ghetto to being a celebrity. He talks about his connection to the hood and how his old associates think negatively of him now.\nIn the censored version, the third verse of the song is completely replaced with new lyrics which talk about the struggles of living, a message to God, and life after death.\n\"I Ain't Mad at Cha\" was the first song to interpolate the core melody of the song \"A Dream\" an album track by DeBarge, written and performed by Bunny, and taken from their 1983 album In a Special Way. This makes the instrumentals very identical. This is most apparent in the piano usage which is almost identical to the original song. The main difference is \"A Dream\" uses a keyboard for its notes, while \"I Ain't Mad at Cha\" uses more of a classical piano. Daz's main job as producer of the song was changing this piano instrument, as most other aspects of the song were the same. Shock G re-played the keys on the piano for the track. The tempo of the original song was also sped up, which matches with 2Pac's pace of rapping. Another minor difference is the accompanying beat uses different sounds to project the same repetition (sped up as previously noted).\nThe day 2Pac was released from prison, he went to the studio and recorded \"I Ain't Mad at Cha\" and \"Ambitionz Az a Ridah\". When 2Pac entered the studio the beat was already complete, and 2Pac wrote the lyrics and recorded the song all in a few hours. Shortly thereafter, BLACKstreet released \"Don't Leave Me\" to radio, which also interpolates the melody of \"A Dream\". According to Dave Aron, 2Pac had a lot of energy going into the studio. Kurupt was in the studio at the time of recording and said when 2Pac heard the beat he \"flipped out\" from excitement. He wanted to finish the song quickly and was cursing at the engineers for moving too slow.\nTechnical info\nMIDI format: 1\nTicks per quarter note: 384\nTempo: Andante (Quarter Note = 84)\nKey: C minor/E\u266d major\nTime signature: 4/4\nFor the video the whole song was re-recorded with a live band.

It first appeared in its original version on Moloko's second album, I Am Not a Doctor; it was released as a single on 8 March 1999, reaching number 45 on the UK Singles Chart. The song experienced chart success after it was remixed by DJ Boris Dlugosch, peaking at number four in the UK in September 1999. Murphy had started writing the lyrics while clubbing in New York City, and knew the song was at heart a dance track, but the group wanted to record it in a different artistic fashion for its album version.\nTogether with their record company they had commissioned mixes by Todd Terry (who had turned Everything But the Girl's \"Missing\" into an international club anthem). Moloko were not satisfied with the Terry mix and had to convince their label Echo Records to put out the Boris D. version instead. The remixed version was eventually featured on over 100 compilations, and was later added on Moloko's third album, Things to Make and Do, after hitting the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. In 1999 it reached number one on the US dance chart. As a form of barter for the remix, Moloko vocalist R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy later co-wrote and appeared on Boris D.'s \"Never Enough\" single, starring in the video for that release as well.\nScottish newspaper Aberdeen Press and Journal viewed \"Sing It Back\" as a \"Balearic hit\". In her review of the I Am Not a Doctor album, Heather Phares from AllMusic described it as a \"techno torch song\". A reviewer from Daily Record said it is \"their best single since 1996's Fun For Me\". Stevie Chick from NME wrote, \"Roisin Murphy, it must be said, has a remarkable voice, a chalky, skewed howl which can twist into a purr, a cry or a sexy growl. On 'Sing It Back', she's cast as Eartha Kitt, all unquenchable lust, sly, coquettish snarls, a luxuriant, lingering sigh. What a shame it's wasted on some of the limpest, radio-friendly handbag tedium ever put on wax.\"\nThe music video was produced to promote the single, directed by Dawn Shadforth. It features Moloko vocalist R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy dancing alone in a metallic flapper dress, accompanied by psychedelic lighting effects. The video is featured on the DVD of Moloko's special edition for the Statues album. It was later published on Moloko's official YouTube channel in October 2016. The video has amassed more than 16,4 million views as of September 2021. \nSeveral live videos exist as well, including one in the group's live concert movie 11,000 Clicks, a similar concert version from the Dutch Pinkpop broadcast, a televised version from the TV show Later... with Jools Holland, and a samba version featured on MTV Brasil.\nQ Magazine ranked \"Sing It Back\" at number 905 in their list of the 1001 Best Songs Ever in 2002.\nAustralian music channel Max placed it at number 887 in their list of 1000 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2012.\nGerman magazine Musikexpress listed the song as number 449 in their ranking of the 700 Best Songs of All-Time in 2014.\nMixmag put the song in their list of Vocal House: The 30 All-Time Biggest Anthems in 2018.\nTomorrowland featured the song in their Official The Ibiza 500 as high as number 55.\nUK CD1\n\"Sing It Back\" (Tee's Radio) \u2013 3:25\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T Loco Mix) \u2013 5:22\n\"Sing It Back\" (DJ Plankton's Dub) \u2013 8:32\nUK CD2\n\"Sing It Back (Boris Musical Mix Edit) \u2013 4:38\n\"Sing It Back (Herbert's Tasteful Dub) \u2013 5:38\n\"Sing It Back (Tee's Freeze Mix) \u2013 9:02\nBoris Dlugosch mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Musical Mix) \u2013 9:15\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Musical Mix Edit) \u2013 4:37\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Main Instrumental) \u2013 9:19\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Funk Dub) \u2013 6:53\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Reprise) \u2013 8:14\n\"Sing It Back\" (BMR Club Mix) \u2013 7:12\nLevent Canseven mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Levent's Funk-O-Rama Mix) \u2013 7:40\n\"Sing It Back\" (Levent's Funk-O-Rama Dub) \u2013 7:42\n\"Sing It Back\" (Can 7 Supermarket Mix) \u2013 8:20\n\"Sing It Back\" (Can 7 Supermarket Radio) \u2013 4:04\nMousse T. mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Bootleg Dub) \u2013 7:37\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Feel Love Mix) \u2013 7:09\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Feelluvdub) \u2013 7:09\nMatthew Herbert mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Herbert's Evangelista Albertini Acid House Mix) \u2013 6:44\n\"Sing It Back\" (Herbert's Tasteful Dub) \u2013 5:58\nTodd Terry mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mike Penfold paranoia ice Mix) \u2013 9:02\n\"Sing It Back\" (Tee's Radio) \u2013 3:26\nBooker T mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T Loco Mix) \u2013 5:23\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T"

It is a spin-off of the BBC Two television series The Choir: Military Wives. It was released on 19 December 2011 following a campaign to make it the 2011 UK Christmas number one. The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 1, claiming the Christmas number 1 \u2013 selling more than 556,000 copies in the week, more than the rest of the Top 12 combined. The song also claimed the status of the biggest first week sales since \"A Moment Like This\" by Leona Lewis sold over 571,000 copies in its first week in 2006. The song was included on their debut studio album In My Dreams.\n\"Wherever You Are\" was nominated for Best British Single in the 2012 BRIT Awards, but the award was won by One Direction for their single \"What Makes You Beautiful\".\nThe Military Wives was formed in 2011 by Gareth Malone for the BBC Two television series The Choir: Military Wives. The programme documented Malone's visits to Chivenor Barracks first and then a few months later to Royal Citadel, Plymouth \u2013 both in Devon, in which he formed two choirs of wives and partners of British military personnel deployed on active service in the Afghanistan War. In forming the choirs, Malone aimed to raise the women's morale and raise their profile in the public perception.\nThe cover art features the emblem of a Remembrance poppy on a green background and the logos of the charities benefiting from the sales. It was released in the UK as a single by Decca Records on 19 December 2011, with proceeds going to the Royal British Legion and SSAFA Forces Help\nThe song competed against rival Christmas campaigns to re-release Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", unsigned YouTube blogger Alex Day, who released multiple remixes of a song called \"Forever Yours\" and The X Factor winners Little Mix, who released a cover version of Damien Rice's \"Cannonball\". There was also a campaign supported by Chris Moyles of BBC Radio 1 to get Lou Monte's 1960 recording of \"Dominick the Donkey\" to Christmas number 1 and this song was number 2 in the iTunes and Amazon charts throughout the majority of the Christmas week behind the Military Wives. Chris Moyles' support of this rival song for Christmas number 1 was controversial because the BBC appeared to be supporting \"Wherever You Are\" to be Christmas number 1 as BBC Radio 2 added the song to their A-list and Chris Evans was a major supporter of the record and the choir.\nOn 29 December 2011 Piers Morgan campaigned on Twitter for the Military Wives Choir to reach number one in the US. He urged his 1.6 million followers to invest in the collective's charity track 'Wherever You Are' following its stateside release on Boxing Day. He tweeted \"Just heard the Military Wives single gets released in the US today,\", posting a link to the official video. \"Watch this my American friends, then go buy it...Good luck ladies, hope you get a No1 in America.\" The Sun reported that the former Britain's Got Talent judge invited the choir to perform on his US show Piers Morgan Tonight.\nThe song was also promoted on the front page of The Blaze, the news site run by American commentator Glenn Beck.\nThe text of \"Wherever You Are\" is a love poem compiled from letters written between the women and their absent husbands and partners. It was set to music by composer Paul Mealor, who is noted for his composition of a choral work sung at the Royal Wedding in 2011.\nThe first public performance of the piece was at The Royal British Legion's Festival of Remembrance held at the Royal Albert Hall on 12 November 2011 attended by The Queen. The event was broadcast in the final episode of The Choir television programme to an estimated television audience of 2.65\u2009million viewers.\nThe Military Wives made a guest appearance on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing on 10 December 2011, when Vincent Simone and Flavia Cacace danced to their performance of \"Wherever You Are\".\nA campaign was launched to promote sales of the CD single, with the aim of it becoming the 2011 Christmas number one in the UK Singles Chart. Support for this campaign was received from BBC Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans. In the traditional, competitive speculation in the run-up to Christmas, the Military Wives single was said to be in"

The song was written by lead vocalist Noddy Holder and bassist Jim Lea, and produced by Chas Chandler. It was the band's sixth and final number-one single in the UK. Earning the UK Christmas number one slot in December 1973, the song beat another Christmas-themed song, Wizzard's \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\", which reached fourth place. It remained in the charts for nine weeks until February 1974.\nReleased at the peak of the band's popularity, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" sold over a million copies upon its first release. It is Slade's last number-one single, and \nby far their best-selling single. It has been released during every decade since 1973, and has been covered by numerous artists. The single was certified UK Platinum by BPI in December 1980. Since 2007 and the advent of downloads counting towards the UK Singles Chart, it has re-entered the charts each December. As of December 2012, it has sold 1.32\u00a0million copies in the UK.\nIn a UK television special on ITV in December 2012, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" was voted third (behind \"Fairytale of New York\" and \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\") in The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song.\nAccording to the Fan Club Newsletter for January and February 1974, the song was awarded a Silver Disc for pre-order sales. Within the first week of release, the single had sold 500,000 copies. Also, according to the same newsletter, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" was in such big demand that Polydor records had to make special arrangements to have 250,000 discs sent from Los Angeles, as well as 30,000 copies a day they were receiving from Germany.\nBy 1973, Slade were one of the most popular bands in Britain, having achieved two number one singles\u2014\"Cum On Feel The Noize\" and \"Skweeze Me Pleeze Me\"\u2014in three months. These singles had both entered the charts straight at number one, a feat unheard of since The Beatles with \"Get Back\" in 1969. During the year, manager Chas Chandler suggested that Slade write and record a Christmas song. Although the other band members were initially against the idea, Lea came up with the basis of the song while taking a shower. After coming up with the verse melody, Lea recalled a song Holder had discarded in 1967, which he had written when the band were named the 'N Betweens. Entitled \"Buy Me a Rocking Chair\", it was Holder's first solo work. \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" used the melody of this song for the chorus, with Lea's melody as the verse. Speaking to Record Mirror in 1984, Lea revealed: \n\"Nod had written the chorus of it in 1967. In those days it was all flower power and Sgt. Pepper and Nod had written this tune. The verse was naff but then he came to the chorus and went 'Buy me a rocking chair to watch the world go by, buy me a looking glass, I'll look you in the eye' - very Sgt. Pepper. I don't use tape recorders, I just remember everything and if something's been written 10 or 15 years ago, it stays up there in my head. I never forgot that chorus, and I was in the shower in America somewhere thinking - Bob Dylan, Bob Dylan - and suddenly out came \"are you hanging up the stocking on the wall\" and I thought that'll go with that chorus Nod did in '67. So I rang Nod and said what about doing a Christmas song and he said alright, so I played it to him and that was it.\"\nAfter an evening out drinking, Holder worked through the night at his mother's house in Walsall to write the lyrics, which he completed in one draft.\nHolder presented his lyrics to Lea, and the pair played the song to Chandler on acoustic guitars. Slade then set off on a sell-out tour. Ten weeks before the song was recorded, drummer Don Powell was injured in a car accident. His girlfriend Angela Morris was killed, and Powell remained in a coma for almost a week. After his eventual recovery, he was able to join the band to record the song. In 2009, PRS for Music announced that up to forty-two percent of the world's population could have listened to the song.\nThe song was recorded in the late summer of 1973, partway through Slade's east coast US tour, at the Record Plant in New York, where John Lennon had just finished working on his album Mind Games. \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" took"

It is a spin-off of the BBC Two television series The Choir: Military Wives. It was released on 19 December 2011 following a campaign to make it the 2011 UK Christmas number one. The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 1, claiming the Christmas number 1 \u2013 selling more than 556,000 copies in the week, more than the rest of the Top 12 combined. The song also claimed the status of the biggest first week sales since \"A Moment Like This\" by Leona Lewis sold over 571,000 copies in its first week in 2006. The song was included on their debut studio album In My Dreams.\n\"Wherever You Are\" was nominated for Best British Single in the 2012 BRIT Awards, but the award was won by One Direction for their single \"What Makes You Beautiful\".\nThe Military Wives was formed in 2011 by Gareth Malone for the BBC Two television series The Choir: Military Wives. The programme documented Malone's visits to Chivenor Barracks first and then a few months later to Royal Citadel, Plymouth \u2013 both in Devon, in which he formed two choirs of wives and partners of British military personnel deployed on active service in the Afghanistan War. In forming the choirs, Malone aimed to raise the women's morale and raise their profile in the public perception.\nThe cover art features the emblem of a Remembrance poppy on a green background and the logos of the charities benefiting from the sales. It was released in the UK as a single by Decca Records on 19 December 2011, with proceeds going to the Royal British Legion and SSAFA Forces Help\nThe song competed against rival Christmas campaigns to re-release Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", unsigned YouTube blogger Alex Day, who released multiple remixes of a song called \"Forever Yours\" and The X Factor winners Little Mix, who released a cover version of Damien Rice's \"Cannonball\". There was also a campaign supported by Chris Moyles of BBC Radio 1 to get Lou Monte's 1960 recording of \"Dominick the Donkey\" to Christmas number 1 and this song was number 2 in the iTunes and Amazon charts throughout the majority of the Christmas week behind the Military Wives. Chris Moyles' support of this rival song for Christmas number 1 was controversial because the BBC appeared to be supporting \"Wherever You Are\" to be Christmas number 1 as BBC Radio 2 added the song to their A-list and Chris Evans was a major supporter of the record and the choir.\nOn 29 December 2011 Piers Morgan campaigned on Twitter for the Military Wives Choir to reach number one in the US. He urged his 1.6 million followers to invest in the collective's charity track 'Wherever You Are' following its stateside release on Boxing Day. He tweeted \"Just heard the Military Wives single gets released in the US today,\", posting a link to the official video. \"Watch this my American friends, then go buy it...Good luck ladies, hope you get a No1 in America.\" The Sun reported that the former Britain's Got Talent judge invited the choir to perform on his US show Piers Morgan Tonight.\nThe song was also promoted on the front page of The Blaze, the news site run by American commentator Glenn Beck.\nThe text of \"Wherever You Are\" is a love poem compiled from letters written between the women and their absent husbands and partners. It was set to music by composer Paul Mealor, who is noted for his composition of a choral work sung at the Royal Wedding in 2011.\nThe first public performance of the piece was at The Royal British Legion's Festival of Remembrance held at the Royal Albert Hall on 12 November 2011 attended by The Queen. The event was broadcast in the final episode of The Choir television programme to an estimated television audience of 2.65\u2009million viewers.\nThe Military Wives made a guest appearance on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing on 10 December 2011, when Vincent Simone and Flavia Cacace danced to their performance of \"Wherever You Are\".\nA campaign was launched to promote sales of the CD single, with the aim of it becoming the 2011 Christmas number one in the UK Singles Chart. Support for this campaign was received from BBC Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans. In the traditional, competitive speculation in the run-up to Christmas, the Military Wives single was said to be in"

It was released as the fourth single from the record on 6 August 2009. Written and produced by Play & Win members Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea and Marcel Botezan, \"Amazing\" is a techno track with a Spanish guitar and beats in its instrumentation. One reviewer regarded the song as being similar to Inna's past work, however, with the addition of new elements. Other music critics gave positive reviews of the single, and praised its construction and foresaw its commercial success.\nPlay & Win were involved in a breach of contract controversy in August 2009, with Romanian singer Anca Badiu sustaining that \"Amazing\" had been originally intended for her before released by Inna. The song was aided by an accompanying music video premiered on 10 September 2009. Shot by Tom Boxer at the Atlantic ocean and near Lisbon, it portrays the singer surfing and being saved from drowning by a lifeguard. For further promotion, Inna also performed \"Amazing\" on several occasions, including at the 2010 Eska Music Awards and the MAD Video Music Awards. Commercially, the song topped the charts in Romania and Bulgaria, while reaching the top 20 in multiple other countries. It was also nominated in two categories at the 2010 Romanian Music Awards, and won in the Pop/Dance Song of the Year section at the 2010 Radio Rom\u00e2nia Actualit\u0103\u021bi Awards.\n\"Amazing\" was written and produced by Romanian trio Play & Win members Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea and Marcel Botezan. It was released on Inna's official website on 6 August 2009, as the fourth single from her debut studio album Hot (2009). The Guardian's Paul Lester noted a Spanish guitar and beats in the song's instrumentation, and called its genre \"half-bad Castillian techno\". An editor of Romanian website Divercity Cafe wrote that the track was club-oriented and reminiscent of Inna's past work, while incorporating new elements.\nUpon its release, \"Amazing\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. An editor of Divercity Cafe praised the harmony between Inna's vocals and the instrumental, and foresaw the single's commercial success. Neeti Sarkar, writing for The Hindu, thought that the song was \"quite amazing in the sense it captures a whirlwind of emotions, musically and otherwise.\" Pro FM listed \"Amazing\" in their list of \"16 hits with which Inna made history\". At the 2010 Romanian Music Awards, the track was nominated in the Best Song and Best Dance categories, and won Pop/Dance Song of the Year at the 2010 Radio Rom\u00e2nia Actualit\u0103\u021bi.\nCommercially, \"Amazing\" topped native Media Forest chart in October 2009 and the Bulgarian charts in December 2009, becoming Inna's second single to reach number one in the first region after \"Hot\" (2008). In France, \"Amazing\" debuted at number two on the SNEP chart in June 2010, where it sold 100,000 registered copies as of September 2010. The track opened at number 10 as the highest new entry on Switzerland's Schweizer Hitparade, while other top 10 placements were achieved in Russia, United Kingdom's dance chart, Greece and the Polish dance chart.\nIn August 2009, \"Amazing\" sparked controversy when Romanian singer Anca Badiu accused Play & Win of \"stealing\" her song and breach of contract. According to Badiu and MediaPro Music, the label she was signed to at that time, they had paid the production trio \u20ac1,500 in advance for \"Amazing\". However, a few days after Baidu recorded the track and the alleged money transfer occurred, Inna released \"Amazing\" as a single. Play & Win defended their decision: \"We signed the contract with MediaPro Music, but at one point we realized that Anca's version could not be a hit, so we chose Inna.\" A Showbiz.ro editor questioned the credibility of their pretext in court, but thought that \"since in Romania, the copyright laws and contractual obligations of artists and producers are not clearly defined, everything is possible.\" They also compared the case to a similar one between Romanian musicians Adrian S\u00een\u0103 and Edward Maya regarding the single \"Se Thelo\" (2009) Sarkar of The Hindu thought that the case was a reason for the song's commercial success.\nAn accompanying music video for \"Amazing\" was premiered on 10 September 2009 on the website of Romanian radio station Radio 21. It was shot by Tom Boxer in late August 2009 at a beach of the Atlantic ocean and near Lisbon, Portugal in the span of two days."

It was released as the album's second single on August 25, 1987, by Sire Records. Its Silver Screen Single Mix later appeared on the EP The Holiday Collection (1991). Written and produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray, the song was inspired by her relationship with then-husband Sean Penn, and his abusive and violent nature. Containing a dance-oriented, up-tempo groove, the song begins with the chorus and is accompanied by a four-note descending bassline and staccato chords in the verses.\nSince its release, \"Causing a Commotion\" has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. The song was a commercial success, peaking within the top-ten in the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and topped the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. Madonna performed the song on the Who's That Girl World Tour in 1987\u00a0\u2013 which was transmitted via satellite to the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards\u00a0\u2013 and the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990. The performances were included in the home video release of the tours.\nIn 1986, Madonna was shooting for her third motion picture Who's That Girl, known at the time as Slammer. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, with whom she had written and produced her third studio album True Blue (1986). The song was written and produced by Madonna and Bray for the film's soundtrack. It was inspired by her then husband Sean Penn and their often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn was on the verge of breaking up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. That translated as the inspiration behind the song. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life,\n\"I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit them [the paparazzi] many times. I never would, you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse.\"\nIn the United States, \"Causing a Commotion\" was released on August 25, 1987. In the United Kingdom, the song was released on September 17, just after the conclusion of the Who's That Girl World Tour that same month. In 1991, the Silver Screen Single Mix of the song was included on the EP The Holiday Collection (1991).\n\"Causing a Commotion\" was recorded and mixed by Stephen Bray along with Shep Pettibone, who also did additional production on the track. Junior Vasquez was the mixing engineer along with Steve Peck, the former also did the audio editing. Background vocals were provided by Donna De Lory and Niki Haris. \"Causing a Commotion\" has a dancey, up-tempo groove in it. The musical arrangement consists of a number of hooks interpolating with each other. It begins with the chorus, where Madonna sings the line \"I've got the moves baby, You've got the motion, If we got together we'd be causing a commotion\". The verses are accompanied by a four-note descending bassline and interjecting staccato chords.\nThe lyrics make reference to Madonna's 1985 hit single \"Into the Groove\" and have three parts to the vocal harmony. Andrzej Ciuk, one of the editors of the book Exploring Space noted that the proverbial status of the phrase \"opposites attract\" as a defining key ingredient of cultural concept of \"love\" and this was evident also in the song with the lyrics: \"You met your match when you met me, I know that you'll disagree it's crazy, But opposites attract you'll see, And I won't let you get away so easy\".\n\"Causing a Commotion\" received generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, said that the song was \"Perfectly acceptable, though not in the same class as 'Who's That Girl'.\" Christian Wright from Spin called the song celebratory. Camille Paglia, one of the authors of The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, said that Madonna's command of massive, resonant basslines impressed her. She wrote: \"I recall my stunned admiration as I sat in the theater in 1987 and first experienced the crashing, descending chords of Madonna's 'Causing a Commotion', which opened her dreadful movie Who's That Girl.

It was released in March 2009 as the second single from his 2009 album Defying Gravity. The song reached number three on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The song also became his highest peak on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 16, and his only top 20 on that chart to date. Urban co-wrote this song with Monty Powell.\nAlong with eventual Idol winner Kris Allen, Urban performed the song live during the finale of the eighth season of American Idol on 20 May 2009.\n\"Kiss a Girl\" is a moderate up-tempo song in which the male narrator expresses a desire to fall in love with a female.\nThom Jurek of AllMusic cited \"Kiss a Girl\" as a standout track on the album, calling it a \"tight little rocker\". He said that it and \"Sweet Thing\", the album's first single, \"are 21st century equivalents of rock & roll love songs.\" Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine described the song unfavorably, saying that it was a retread of his previous single \"Sweet Thing\", which itself was described as a retread of Urban's earlier material.\nBoth a finalised and a promotional music video for \"Kiss a Girl\" are available for view on CMT and were both directed by Chris Hicky.\nThe promotional video for the song premiered in April 2009 on CMT's website. It consists of Urban and his band performing in front of a green screen. Some of these scenes were later edited and included the TV video.\nThe official video was found on iTunes on 25 May 2009. It consists of Urban and the band performing in an animated city. Also included is two people who eventually find each other and fall in love. At the end, the ferris wheel they ride displays \"KISS\" on each car, a reference to the song's title. This video debuted on CMT's Top Twenty Countdown at No. 11 for the week of 5 June 2009 and has peaked at No. 2. It also reached No. 3 on GAC's Top 20 Countdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurek, Thom. \"Defying Gravity review\". AllMusic. Retrieved 9 April 2009.\nKeefe, Jonathan (30 March 2009). \"Defying Gravity review\".

It was released as the fourth single from the record on 6 August 2009. Written and produced by Play & Win members Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea and Marcel Botezan, \"Amazing\" is a techno track with a Spanish guitar and beats in its instrumentation. One reviewer regarded the song as being similar to Inna's past work, however, with the addition of new elements. Other music critics gave positive reviews of the single, and praised its construction and foresaw its commercial success.\nPlay & Win were involved in a breach of contract controversy in August 2009, with Romanian singer Anca Badiu sustaining that \"Amazing\" had been originally intended for her before released by Inna. The song was aided by an accompanying music video premiered on 10 September 2009. Shot by Tom Boxer at the Atlantic ocean and near Lisbon, it portrays the singer surfing and being saved from drowning by a lifeguard. For further promotion, Inna also performed \"Amazing\" on several occasions, including at the 2010 Eska Music Awards and the MAD Video Music Awards. Commercially, the song topped the charts in Romania and Bulgaria, while reaching the top 20 in multiple other countries. It was also nominated in two categories at the 2010 Romanian Music Awards, and won in the Pop/Dance Song of the Year section at the 2010 Radio Rom\u00e2nia Actualit\u0103\u021bi Awards.\n\"Amazing\" was written and produced by Romanian trio Play & Win members Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea and Marcel Botezan.

It is from her debut studio album of the same name (2009). The song was written and produced by Play & Win members Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea and Marcel Botezan. Musically, \"Hot\" is a trance-inspired electro house song, with its instrumentation consisting of synthesizer sounds and trance beats. Throughout the track, the hook is repeated multiple times, and male vocals are used to complement Inna.\nMusic critics gave generally positive to mixed reviews of the recording, commending its simplicity, efficacy and dance nature, while criticizing the quality of its lyrics and calling the track innovation loose. One reviewer also compared \"Hot\" to the work of British rock band New Order and French disc jockey David Guetta. The song won in the Best Dance category at the 2009 Romanian Music Awards, while it was nominated for an Eska Music Award in the same year. Commercially, it became Inna's breakthrough single, topping the charts in Bulgaria, Romania and Spain and reaching the top 20 in multiple countries. Due to high sales, \"Hot\" was awarded Gold and Platinum certifications in Denmark, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\nFor promotion, two accompanying music videos\u2014known as \"True Love Edit\" and \"Dancing in the Dark Edit\"\u2014were shot by Florin Botea and released in 2008. The first clip portrays a female nightclub dancer receiving cards from a supposed admirer, who then turns out to be her partner, while the second was meant to emphasize Inna's image. The singer performed the track live multiple times, including at the 2009 Eska Music Awards, Sopot Hit Festival, MAD Video Music Awards and her own Inna: Live la Arenele Romane gig in Bucharest. Dutch DJ duo Blasterjaxx also notably remixed \"Hot\" for the 2016 Ultra Music Festival to positive response.\nAs a child Inna became interested in music, with her mother, grandmother and grandfather singing as a hobby. She attended the Colegiul Economic (Economy College) in Mangalia, later studying political science at Ovidius University in Constan\u021ba. Inna also took singing lessons and participated in music festivals, while unsuccessfully auditioning for the Romanian band A.S.I.A. When Inna worked in an office, her manager heard her singing and contacted Play & Win. Adopting the stage name Alessandra in 2008, she approached a pop-rock style, which switched to \"commercial\" minimal-infused house music after changing her stage name to Inna.\n\"Hot\" was entirely written and produced by Play & Win members Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea and Marcel Botezan, and was released as the first single from Inna's debut studio album of the same name (2009). It was sent to Romanian radio station Vibe FM on 12 August 2008, where it was played for the first time during the radio programme Request 629. During an interview with Romanian website Music Pass, Inna stated: \"[Play & Win] presented us 'Hot' [...] which I didn't like. It sounded weird and different from what I had learned from [my music teacher]. [...] It was a little strange, much more effects, [...] something like S.F..\" The track had been previously offered to Romanian singer Alessia to record, who however rejected it as it did not match her standards. On another occasion, Inna stated that the track emerged \"out of fun\" and that its success surprised her.\n\"Hot\" has been described as an \"unadulterated and stylised\" trance-inspired electro house song. Its hook: \"Fly like you do it / Like you're high like you do it / Like you fly like do it / Like a woman\" is repeated multiple times throughout the track. Male \"la la la\" vocals complement \"Hot\", which according to Paul Lester of The Guardian sound \"as though a hunky waiter from the local beach cafe wandered into shot\". BBC's Fraser McAlpine noticed that the singer \"is clearly using the words to this song as a kind of percussion to break up the music\", which contains \"ticky\" synthesizer sounds similar to German band Boney M.'s \"Ma Baker\" (1977), and \"trancey, hypnotic\" beats. The word \"hot\" is never mentioned throughout the single. According to Inna, its verses and refrain are interpretable, with her stating that the \"Do it like a woman\" lines were not meant to have a pornographic connotation.\nUpon its release, \"Hot\" was generally met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy, awarded it four out of five stars, and praised its simplicity and efficacy. He further wrote: \"expect [it] to coax you onto the dancefloor"

It was released in early 2002 by Mushroom Records as second single from the album, with the exception of North America, where Interscope issued \"Breaking Up the Girl\" instead. In the years since release, \"Cherry Lips\" has become an enduring track for the band, an alternative rock LGBTQ anthem, and after almost two decades continues to resonate, being used as the home run song of the Milwaukee Brewers and in advertisement campaigns for Microsoft's Surface Go laptop tablets.\n\"Cherry Lips\" faltered in major markets, but was a huge hit in Italy, where it had been the sound of a prominent winter marketing campaign for Breil Stones, reaching #8 on the Italian charts. Like lead single \"Androgyny\", \"Cherry Lips\" was a success in New Zealand and Australia, where it became Garbage's biggest hit single, spending five non-consecutive weeks in the top ten. \"Cherry Lips\" was ultimately certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\nAs the first Garbage single fully released in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the band donated a percentage of the royalties generated from the sales of \"Cherry Lips\" to the International Red Cross.\n\"Cherry Lips\" was written and recorded at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. Written just as Garbage were about to begin mixing their third album, \"Cherry Lips\" was a late inclusion to the album. The song began as a keyboard melody, and was originally known by the working title \"Wonderjam\". While recording the song, Steve Marker played a tuba, and recorded the output of the audio being run through a wah-wah pedal. Daniel Shulman, at the end of his second set of scheduled bass sessions for the album, quickly created a sub-hook bassline for the chorus on a Sabre bass run through an Ampeg B15 amplifier. The band was happy with the bassline and used it on the final mix of \"Cherry Lips\". Manson described \"Cherry Lips\" as \"an adrenaline rush\" and \"probably the most celebratory song we've ever written\".\nShirley Manson wrote the lyrics based loosely around two novels she had just read, Sarah and The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, written by author Laura Albert under the pseudonym of JT LeRoy. \"I took a bit of poetic license, but I wrote it for JT. It's easily the most uplifting thing we've ever done. It sounds nothing like us; it sounds like a Shangri-Las song\", Manson explained. Like the rest of the world, Manson had believed that LeRoy had been a teenage truck-stop hustler who'd escaped the streets to become a writer. Manson exchanged emails with LeRoy over the course of the album sessions. \"I wanted to write an ode to transgender spirit, inspired by my interactions with this peculiar but emotionally generous creature I knew online as JT\", Manson later recalled. On the Beautiful Garbage sleeve notes, Manson dedicated \"Cherry Lips\" to \"The Terminator\", another alias of JT LeRoy.  In 2005, LeRoy was exposed as an invention of Laura Albert in articles published by Stephen Beachy, The New York Times and Vanity Fair. \"I know a lot of people felt conned in the end,\" Manson explained. \"I didn't. I just felt sad that a woman felt she would stand a better chance in the world if she was a man, that JT was 'dead' and wouldn't be part of my life anymore\". Manson still felt that the books \"remain a marvel and whoever wrote them is still a genius whether they are a man, woman or wilderbeast.\"\n\"We were in different headspaces every time we recorded, which is why every song is different,\" Manson later explained, \"\"Silence Is Golden\" is probably the heaviest song we've ever recorded and \"Cherry Lips\" the poppiest. They're juxtaposed right next to each other.\" When Manson recorded her lead vocal, the takes were heavily EQ'd at the tracking stage (\"lt was tracked that way for effect\", explained engineer Billy Bush, \"it sounded weirder that way!\").\nThe first territory to receive a \"Cherry Lips\" commercial release was Japan, where Sony Music Int'l issued a five-track CD maxi of \"Cherry Lips\" remixes on December 27, coinciding with the announcement of Garbage's upcoming tour dates in Tokyo and Osaka. In February 2002, Sony followed up the single by issuing Special Collection, an exclusive extended play collecting together the international b-sides with artwork from the \"Cherry Lips\" music video.\nAcross Europe, PIAS Recordings issued \"Cherry Lips\" on"

A-side: Anitina (The First Time I See She Dance). artist: M|A|R|R|S. cover: MARRS - Pump up the volume (frontal).jpg. genre: Hip hop. label: 4AD, 4th & B'way, Island, PolyGram. length: 4:08 (7-inch version), 6:28 (12-inch version). misc: Audio sample file help\nMusic video\"Pump Up the Volume\" on YouTube. name: Pump Up the Volume. producer: John Fryer, Martyn Young. recorded: 1987. released: 3 August 1987. type: single. writer: Martyn Young, Steve Young. \"Pump Up the Volume\" is the only single by British recording act M|A|R|R|S. Recorded and released in 1987, it was a number-one hit in many countries and is regarded as a significant milestone in the development of British acid house music and music sampling. The song derives its title directly from a lyrical sample from \"I Know You Got Soul\", a hit single by labelmates Eric B. & Rakim, released months prior in that same year.\nThe single was the product of an uneasy collaboration between electronic group Colourbox and alternative rock band A.R. Kane, two groups signed to the independent label 4AD. The link-up was suggested by label founder Ivo Watts-Russell after the two groups had independently sounded him out about the possibility of releasing a commercially oriented dance record, inspired by the American house music that was starting to make an impact on the UK chart. When the M|A|R|R|S project was first released early in 1987, the popularity of the style of the song had already started to grow.\nA.R. Kane had released an E.P. entitled When You're Sad on One Little Indian Records in late 1986. Frustrated by the lack of support from One Little Indian, Alex Ayuli of the band approached 4AD owner Ivo Watts-Russell to see if his label would take them on. Derek Birkett, the owner of One Little Indian, was under the impression that 4AD were trying to poach his band, and, along with label designer Paul White and Einar \u00d6rn Benediktsson from the Sugarcubes, visited the 4AD offices in Alma Road to confront Watts-Russell. Colin Wallace, a 4AD staff member, convened a team from the warehouse to support Watts-Russell. Despite a heated argument in which a furious Birkett told Watts-Russell \"You don't do that. You fucking stole my fucking band,\" A.R. Kane signed to 4AD for a one-off release. Following the release of the Lollita EP, the band voiced their disappointment with One Little Indian, who had failed to deliver on a promise that A.R. Kane could work with producer Adrian Sherwood. Watts-Russell suggested that they instead work with Martyn Young of Colourbox.\nThe collaboration between the two groups did not go entirely to plan. Once in the studio, the groups' different working methods and personalities failed to gel. Producer John Fryer found himself in the middle and unable to resolve the conflict between the two groups. The result was that instead of working together, the groups ended up recording a track each, then exchanging them to the other for additional input. Colourbox came up with \"Pump Up the Volume\", a percussion-led near-instrumental, featuring an Eric B. & Rakim sample that gave it its title, while A.R. Kane created the more deliberately arty \"Anitina (The First Time I See She Dance)\" in another studio. Colourbox then added a heavy drum-machine rhythm and effects to \"Anitina\" and A.R. Kane overdubbed some additional guitar to \"Pump Up the Volume.\" The coup de grace, however, was the addition of scratch mix effects and samples by DJs Chris \"C.J.\" Mackintosh and Dave Dorrell. Colourbox told Watts-Russell that they didn't want \"Anitina\" on the B-side and wanted \"Pump Up the Volume\" released solely as a Colourbox track. Watts-Russell overruled them, in part because of Young's notoriously slow work rate with the prospect of the track being held up for another 12 to 18 months, and released the track as M|A|R|R|S as originally planned. This led to the relationship with the band collapsing, and they never recorded for 4AD again.\nThe two tracks were released to United Kingdom dance clubs in July 1987, on an anonymous white label with no artist credit. \"Pump Up the Volume\" proved to be the more popular side and was the track more heavily promoted. 4AD released the 12\" single (as, officially, a double A-side) on 24 August of that year. It entered the UK Singles Chart the following week at number 35, a strong initial showing for an unknown act, especially with 12\" sales. However, what gave \"Pump Up the Volume\" its commercial edge was the remix released a week later. This remix became the best-known version of the track, transforming it by the addition of numerous samples that provided the record with additional hooks besides its oft-repeated title chant, such as those of tracks by Public Enemy, Criminal Element Orchestra and the Bar-Kays. It was this remix, rather than the original, that was edited down to create the 7-inch version of the track, which began picking up radio play.\nAs the record climbed the charts, the single ran into legal"

It is a good example of Marr and Sumner's original concept of mixing the fluid synthesizers of New Order with The Smiths' rich guitar sound.\nMarr composed the music then Sumner wrote the lyric as engineer Owen Morris played him the song every four bars. Marr was reluctant to layer multiple guitar parts as he was wary of treading ground, but Sumner convinced him otherwise.\nDuring recording, Primal Scream vocalist Denise Johnson added a vocal at the end of the song. She went on to provide additional vocals on a number of songs on Electronic's second album Raise the Pressure five years later.\nThe single was issued in the UK on 7-inch, 12-inch, CD and cassette by Factory Records on 15 April 1991 (and two weeks later as a second 12-inch comprising two additional remixes by DNA), and as a three-format maxi single and standard cassette by Warner Bros. Records in the USA.\n\"Get the Message\" appeared as a remixed 7-inch edit on most of the formats, and in its original, full-length version on the first UK 12-inch. Later pressings of the UK 7-inch and the German CD maxi single featured an edit of the album version, which was also used for the music video. This was because Bernard Sumner objected to the earlier mix, having heard it on a Manchester radio station prior to the release of the single.\nThe US and German maxi singles compiled all of these versions collectively; the only recordings from this single that remain scarce are edits of the two DNA remixes which were released on promos, namely a British 7-inch and a US CD maxi single.\nLike its predecessor \"Getting Away with It\", \"Get the Message\" featured a non-album track as its B-side: \"Free Will\", a mercurial, sample-heavy dance track. This appeared in greatly edited form on the 7-inch releases, and in its original six-minute form on all the others. (The German CD maxi single included both) An edited version is included on the 2013 re-release of the album Electronic.\nThe first releases were packaged by Johnson/Panas (the moniker of Trevor Johnson), who also designed Electronic's then imminent first album Electronic. Each format bore a unique colour scheme, all versions featuring the artist and single name with a bold number \"2\" underneath, signifying its place in Electronic's discography. The only format which differed from this theme was the second British 12-inch release, designed by 3a (who also oversaw third single \"Feel Every Beat\").\n\n\"Get the Message\"\n\"Free Will\"\nThe 7-inch and cassette comprised edits of both songs.\n\"Get the Message\" (DNA Groove Mix)\n\"Get the Message\" (DNA Sin Mix)\nThis record was only released in Britain.\n\"Get the Message\" (7\")\n\"Free Will\" (12\")\n\"Get the Message\" (12\")\n\"Get the Message\" (Extended Mix)\n\"Free Will\" (Extended Mix)\n\"Get the Message\" (DNA Groove Mix)\n\"Get the Message\" (DNA Sin Mix)\nThe CD included \"Get the Message\" (Single Mix).\n\"Get the Message\" (7\")\n\"Get the Message\" (12\")\n\"Free Will\" (7\")\n\"Free Will\" (12\")\n\"Get the Message\" (DNA Groove Mix)\n\"Get the Message\" (DNA Sin Mix)\nThe single was promoted by a colourful music video in which Marr and Sumner strolled through the Philippines and atop the still-active Taal Volcano \u2014 which Marr narrowly missed falling into. It was directed by Gunther Deichmann, whose published photographs had impressed Electronic.\nAt least two versions of this film exist, one with phrases from the song lyrics punctuating the scenic shots (and lower-case letters spelling out 'electronic') and another more simple edit without any words. The former version is available on the Get the Message DVD.\nElectronic also promoted the single with appearances on Top of the Pops in April and May 1991, miming to the album edit and the edit of the \"DNA Groove Mix\" respectively.\nCommercial reception to the song was quite positive. It reached #8 on the UK Singles Chart, which became one of their highest positions. It also performed strongly in the United States, where it reached the top of the Modern Rock Tracks chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.\nCritical reaction to \"Get the Message\" was generally positive. Writing in the NME, Andrew Collins called the song \"draught genius\" and concluded that \"New Order can now split up\", while David Quantick stated"

It is a classic of the band's repertoire and has been consistently played at live shows ever since its release. Written and produced by Mike Scott, the subject of the song has inspired some speculation.\nThe single was not a big success when initially released in 1985, only making the lower ends of the chart, although it reached No. 12 on the Australian chart. Subsequently, it became one of the Waterboys' best-known songs and their most commercially successful. It is arguably the band's signature song and was the Ivor Novello Award winner \"Best Song Musically and Lyrically\" in 1991. Upon its re-release in 1991, it reached No. 3 in the United Kingdom.\nThe subject of the lyrics has inspired speculation, some of which has been rebutted by the writer. The song began as a \"scribble on the back of an envelope on a wintry New York street\", after Scott's girlfriend asked him if it was difficult to write a song. Scott added further lyrics to the song upon returning to his hotel and after his return to London.\nLike the Waterboys' first single \"A Girl Called Johnny\", the song is a tribute to an inspirational figure or figures. In each line, the singer describes his own perspective and immediately contrasts it with that of the song's subject, summarizing the difference with the line \"I saw the crescent / You saw the whole of the moon\".\nAllMusic instead suggests that its subject is a number of people who inspired Scott, including writer C. S. Lewis and the musician Prince. Scott himself says that he \"couldn't have written\" the song without having read Mark Helprin's novel Winter's Tale, but goes on to state that the song is not about Helprin. The official Waterboys website's Frequently Asked Questions clarifies that Scott has said that the song's subject is \"a composite of many people\", including C. S. Lewis, but explicitly states that it is not about Prince. Musician Nikki Sudden, with whom Scott had collaborated before forming the Waterboys, has claimed that the song was written about himself. In a 2020 interview, Scott specifically rejected claims that it was about Sudden or Prince: he said that he wrote a message \"on the record's label saying, 'For Prince, U saw the whole of the moon'\" as a reference to discussions between himself and Karl Wallinger about creating a Prince-inspired sound when they were recording the song. He explained:\nThe Whole of the Moon is about someone like CS Lewis, who seemed to see so much and explore issues much more deeply than most people, or it could be about a Jimi Hendrix-type person who comes \"like a comet, blazing your trail\" and is gone too soon, but it's not specifically about anyone.\nThe band members at the time were Mike Scott, Anthony Thistlethwaite, Karl Wallinger, and Roddy Lorimer. Drummer Kevin Wilkinson had left the band by the time \"The Whole of the Moon\" was recorded and drums were played by session player, Chris Whitten. Demoed but not finished at the beginning of the recording sessions, the song was eventually completed in May 1985.\nScott composed the song's piano part, which he described as \"a self-taught rhythm with one finger doing one pattern and three fingers doing another\", upon returning to the UK from New York.\nA feature of \"The Whole of the Moon\" is the trumpet work on the recording, courtesy of the classically trained Lorimer. Scott has said that he wanted the trumpets to have a similar impact to the flugelhorns on the Beatles' \"Penny Lane\": \"like sunlight bursting through clouds\". Lorimer spent three days with Scott working on the song's arrangement and \"went home with a tape of the song and thought about a more classical approach. After a while sitting at the piano I came up with the idea of antiphonal trumpets. A piccolo trumpet on the left answered a piccolo on the right and then the same again, growing by adding a B\u266d trumpet below each side of the stereo picture. Mike loved it, except the slightly jazzy chords I had used on the run down at the very end, which he simplified. I used the same classical approach later in the song, mixing two classical-type trumpets behind a later verse.\"\nLorimer also contributes falsetto background vocals to the song, while Thistlethwaite, another brass section member, performs a saxophone solo near the end, commencing after an explosion-like sound achieved by adding"

It was released in 1986 as the third single from the album Different Light.  It was the band's first number one single, being certified gold by the RIAA, and became Billboard's number-one song of 1987.\nLiam Sternberg, who wrote the song, had finished a demo version by January 1984 with singer Marti Jones. He offered it to Toni Basil, who turned it down. Lene Lovich recorded the first version of the song, but it went unreleased when she decided to take a break from music to raise her family. David Kahne from Peer Southern Publishing was the producer of Different Light; he received a copy of the demo and liked it, especially Jones's \"offhand quality\".\nKahne took the song to the Bangles, who agreed to record it. He had each member of the group sing the lyrics to determine who would sing each verse; Vicki Peterson, Michael Steele, and Susanna Hoffs sang lead vocals in the final version on the first, second, and third verses, respectively. Kahne particularly disliked Debbi Peterson's leads, so she was relegated to backing vocals. This angered her and caused tension within the group. The situation was exacerbated by the use of a drum machine in place of her drumming, further diminishing her role in the song. She can be seen playing the tambourine during their 1986 performance on The Old Grey Whistle Test. The whistling in the song was actually played by a machine.\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was released as the third single from Different Light. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1986. The song reached a peak of number three on the UK Singles Chart in November 1986 and reached number one in the US on December 20, staying at the top of the Hot 100 for four weeks, carrying it over into January 1987. The success of the song and \"Manic Monday\" propelled Different Light to number two on the Billboard 200 chart, making it the group's most successful album.\nThe music video for \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was nominated for Best Group Video at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards. It features both the Bangles performing the song at a concert and scenes of people dancing in  poses similar to those depicted in the Ancient Egyptian reliefs that inspired songwriter Liam Sternberg. Most of these people were filmed on the streets of New York City, although special effects were used to modify photos of Princess Diana, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and the Statue of Liberty. In a popular scene from the video, Hoffs was filmed in a close-up where her eyes moved from side to side, looking left and right. When asked about the scene in an interview, Hoffs explained that she was looking at individual audience members during the video shoot, which took place with a live audience. Looking directly at individual audience members was a technique she used to overcome stage fright, and she was unaware that the camera had a close-up on her while she was employing this technique, switching between one audience member on her left and one on her right.\nIn 1990, \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was re-issued as a single in the UK to promote the Bangles' Greatest Hits album. It featured new remixes for the song called Ozymandias Remix. It charted at number 73 in the UK.\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" was one of the songs which were claimed to have been banned by Clear Channel following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Snopes in researching this found that the list was simply suggestions regarding songs to be sensitive about when deciding what to play. It was also included in a \"list of records to be avoided\" drawn up by the BBC during the Gulf War.\n(*) indicates the list is unordered.\n1985 release\n7\" single\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (3:21)\n\"Angels Don't Fall in Love\" (3:21)\n12\" maxi\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (extended dance mix) (5:48)\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (dub mix) (5:17)\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (a capella mix) (2:47)\n1986 release\n7\" single\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (3:21)\n\"Not Like You\" (3:05)\n12\" maxi\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (extended dance mix) (5:48)\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (dub mix) (5:17)\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\" (a cappella mix) (2:47)\n\"Angels Don't Fall in Love\" (3:21)\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1986\nList of Billboard Year-End number-one singles and albums\nList of Hot 100 Airplay number-one singles of the 1980s\nList of number-one singles in Australia during the"

Written by Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor but credited to Queen, it is the opening track on the album of the same name, and was released as the first single from the album. The single debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart in January 1991, the band's first number-one hit since \"Under Pressure\" in 1981, and additionally reached the top ten in ten other countries. It is included on the band's second compilation album Greatest Hits II.\nAt six-and-a-half minutes, it is one of Queen's epic songs. The song has been described as \"reminiscent\" of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" because it was \"harking back to their progressive rock roots\". It features  a flamenco guitar section performed by Yes guitarist Steve Howe and Brian May, an operatic interlude and sections of hard rock that recall early Queen, in addition to the lyric inspired in part by Mercury's illness; although media stories about his health were being denied strenuously, he was by now seriously ill with AIDS, which would claim his life in November 1991, 10 months after the song was released.\nThe song was accompanied by a music video featuring animated representations of the band on a cinema screen akin to Nineteen Eighty-Four, eerie plasticine figure stop-motion and harrowing imagery. It has been described as one of the band's darkest and most moving works. AllMusic described the song as a \"superb epic\" which deals with \"mankind's inability to live harmoniously\".\n\"Innuendo\" was pieced together \"like a jigsaw puzzle\". The recurring theme (with the Bol\u00e9ro-esque beat) started off as a jam session between May, Deacon and Taylor. Mercury then added the melody and some of the lyric, which were then completed by Taylor.\nThe middle section was primarily Mercury's work, according to an interview with May in October 1994's Guitar Magazine. It features a flamenco guitar solo, followed by a classically influenced bridge, and then the solo again but performed with electric guitars. This section is especially complex, featuring a pattern of three bars in 5/4 time (reasonably uncommon in popular music) followed by five bars in the more often used 3/4 time. The end of the flamenco-guitar style is based on the 5/4 bar, but is in 6/4 time.\nThe bridge section (\"You can be anything you want to be\") features sophisticated orchestration, created by Mercury and producer David Richards using the popular Korg M1 keyboard/synth/workstation. Mercury had arranged and co-arranged orchestras in his solo career, and closed the previous Queen album with the track \"Was It All Worth It\", which included a Gershwin-esque interlude also coming from an M1 synth. The Bridge section in \"Innuendo\" is in 3/4, showing once again Mercury's affection for triple metres: \"Bicycle Race\" is another one with main sections in 4/4 and middle-eight in 3/4, and some of his best-known pieces (namely \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Somebody to Love\") were in 6/8, as would be his last composition, \"A Winter's Tale\".\nSteve Howe has said he was \"so proud\" to have played on the song and he became the only Queen non-member to have played guitar on a studio recording of a Queen song. Howe and Mercury had been friends for several years, since they ran into each other quite often at the Townhouse Studios in London. Yes had recorded Going for the One at Mountain Studios in 1976\u201377 shortly before Queen bought the Swiss studio, and Asia's debut album was produced by Queen's engineer, Mike Stone.\nOn a break from a recording session in Geneva, Howe drove to Montreux and stopped to have lunch. There he ran into Martin Groves, who had worked for Yes before and by this time was Queen's equipment supervisor. Groves told him Queen were in the studio at the moment.\nAs soon as Steve Howe went into the studios, Mercury asked him to play some guitar (according to producer David Richards, who had worked with Yes in the past as well). Another version is that Brian May was the one who asked him to play the flamenco bit. When the members of Queen asked if Howe wanted to play on the title track, Howe politely suggested they\u2019d lost their minds. It took the combined weight of Mercury, May and Taylor to persuade him.\nAccording to Steve Howe:\nInside, there\u2019s Freddie, Brian and Roger all sitting together. They go: \u2018Let\u2019s play you the album\u2019. Of course, I\u2019m hearing it"

The song first appeared on McLachlan's fourth studio album, Surfacing, in 1997 and was released as the album's fourth and final single the following year. The lyrics are about the death of Jonathan Melvoin (1961\u20131996), the Smashing Pumpkins' touring keyboard player, from a heroin overdose, as McLachlan explained on VH1 Storytellers. It is sometimes mistitled as \"In the Arms of an Angel\" or \"Arms of the Angel\".\n\"Angel\" was McLachlan's second consecutive top-five hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number four. It also spent 12 weeks at number one on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, placing as the number-one song on that chart for 1999. In McLachlan's native Canada, it reached number seven on the RPM Top Singles chart and number three on the Adult Contemporary chart. Outside North America, the song has charted in several countries in the years following its release, including reaching number seven in Ireland in 2002 and number nine in Norway in 2008.\n\"Angel\" was one of the first songs written for Surfacing. McLachlan said that writing it was easy, \"a real joyous occasion\", and that \"the bulk of it came in about three hours\". It was inspired by articles that she read in Rolling Stone about musicians turning to heroin to cope with the pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosing, most notably Jonathan Melvoin, a keyboardist for the Smashing Pumpkins, who died of an overdose in 1996. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: \"I've been in that place where you've messed up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable\u2014and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape.\" She said that the song is about \"trying not to take responsibility for other people's problems and trying to love yourself at the same time\".\nThe song has a sparse arrangement\u2014mostly McLachlan at the piano, with subtle upright bass played by Jim Creeggan of Barenaked Ladies. It was recorded in the key of D-flat major. For live performances, it is transposed up one half-step to D major, the key it was originally written in, and played without the bass.\nReleased as a single in 1998, \"Angel\" peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 on 22 February 1999 (spending 19 weeks in the top ten), finishing as the 18th most popular song of the year. It reached number one on three Billboard charts: the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, the Adult Top 40 chart, and the Top 40 Tracks chart. It spent 12 weeks at number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, finishing as the number-one song of the year on that chart. In McLachlan's native Canada, \"Angel\" peaked at number seven on the RPM Top Singles chart in February 1999, ending the year as its forty-eighth most successful single. It also peaked at number three on the Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary chart.\nIn the years following its release, \"Angel\" has charted in a large number of countries. On 21 January 2002, British producers Rollo Armstrong and Mark Bates (as their joint venture Dusted) released a remix that peaked at number seven in Ireland and number 36 in the United Kingdom. In 2008, \"Angel\" charted in Norway and peaked at number nine for two weeks. The following year, it made a brief appearance on the New Zealand Singles Chart, debuting and peaking at number 36 in July. The song has charted in Austria and Switzerland on several occasions, peaking at number 17 in both counties, and it also reached number 57 in Germany in October 2012. The following month, it debuted and peaked at number 77 in France. During its original release, \"Angel\" peaked at number 99 on the Dutch Single Top 100, but it reached a new peak of number 31 in February 2014.\nOn 8 April 2000, McLachlan performed \"Angel\" with Carlos Santana on guitar at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California. The show was televised on Fox TV and released on the DVD Supernatural Live \u2013 An Evening with Carlos Santana and Friends. On 2 July 2005, McLachlan performed this song at Live 8 Philadelphia with Josh Groban. She also performed the song during the \"Concert for Linda,\" dedicating it to the memory of Linda McCartney. On 10 September 2011, McLachlan performed the song to close the ceremonies at the dedication of the Flight 93 Memorial in Stonycreek Township, commemorating the passengers and"

It is the first track on their tenth studio album, All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), and was released as the album's lead single on 9 October 2000. The song was a commercial success, helping launch the album to multi-platinum status, and is one of U2's biggest hits to date.\nLike many tracks from All That You Can't Leave Behind, \"Beautiful Day\" harkens back to the group's past sound. The tone of the Edge's guitar was a subject of debate amongst the band members, as they disagreed on whether he should use a sound similar to that from their early career in the 1980s. The band's lead vocalist Bono explained that the upbeat track is about losing everything but still finding joy in what one has.\nThe song received positive reviews, and it became the band's 14th number-one single in their native Ireland, fourth number-one in the United Kingdom, and their first number-one in the Netherlands. It also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Finland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Scotland and Spain and reached the top 10 in Austria, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. The song peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, the band's highest position since \"Discoth\u00e8que\" in 1997.\nIn 2001, the song won three Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. The group has played \"Beautiful Day\" at every one of their concerts since the song's live debut on the Elevation Tour in 2001.\n\"Beautiful Day\" originated from recording sessions held by U2 in a small room at Hanover Quay Studio in Dublin in the winter of 1999. In its earliest permutation, \"Beautiful Day\" was a different song called \"Always\", which was later released as a B-side. The song's genesis came from a chord sequence that lead vocalist Bono composed and that guitarist the Edge subsequently adapted. The group worked on the song for several days in the studio, but were unable to make much progress with it. The Edge said, \"As a straight rock song, it was pretty ho-hum.\" Co-producer Daniel Lanois said: \"the sound of it was a bit stuck in the barroom, and as usual our expectations were high. We wanted to feel the future and not just the past.\"\nCo-producer Brian Eno was frustrated with the lack of progress on the song, and early one morning, he and Lanois arrived in the studio before U2 to prepare some musical ideas. Eno created a rhythm on a drum machine, over which he added a piano part and synthesised strings. Lanois played a guitar part on a Fender Telecaster that was a third above the root of the Edge's guitar sequence, providing what he described as a \"choral quality, like harmony singing\". The producers' ideas proved to be musically inspiring to the band when they arrived and resumed work on the song. Lanois described the Edge's resulting guitar playing as \"sounding like shattered, splintered metal coming at you like a meteor storm\". Near the end of a 20-minute jam of the song, Bono sang, \"It's a beautiful day, don't let it get away\". After taking a lunch break, the producers thought that Bono's improptu vocal from the outro could be made into the song's chorus. They quickly edited the vocal part into earlier sections of the jam, turning it into what would be the chorus of \"Beautiful Day\".\nBefore leaving the studio one day, the Edge listened to the chorus vocals, and thinking they sounded bare, he picked up a microphone and improvised a backing vocal, singing a high fifth. At the same time, Lanois harmonised a lower doo-wop style vocal that he described as similar to those in \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\". Their voices were then doubled and processed by Eno. The Edge called the backing vocals a \"beautiful counterpoint\" to Bono's singing and \"the final key element that the song needed\".\nDuring the recording process for the All That You Can't Leave Behind album, the band decided to distance themselves from their 1990s experimentation with electronic dance music in favour of a \"return to the traditional U2 sound\". At the same time, the band was looking for a more forward looking sound. This led to debate amongst the band when the Edge was playing the song on his Gibson Explorer guitar with a tone used in much of their early material up to their 1983 album War. Bono was particularly resistant to the guitar"

Written by Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor but credited to Queen, it is the opening track on the album of the same name, and was released as the first single from the album. The single debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart in January 1991, the band's first number-one hit since \"Under Pressure\" in 1981, and additionally reached the top ten in ten other countries. It is included on the band's second compilation album Greatest Hits II.\nAt six-and-a-half minutes, it is one of Queen's epic songs. The song has been described as \"reminiscent\" of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" because it was \"harking back to their progressive rock roots\". It features  a flamenco guitar section performed by Yes guitarist Steve Howe and Brian May, an operatic interlude and sections of hard rock that recall early Queen, in addition to the lyric inspired in part by Mercury's illness; although media stories about his health were being denied strenuously, he was by now seriously ill with AIDS, which would claim his life in November 1991, 10 months after the song was released.\nThe song was accompanied by a music video featuring animated representations of the band on a cinema screen akin to Nineteen Eighty-Four, eerie plasticine figure stop-motion and harrowing imagery. It has been described as one of the band's darkest and most moving works. AllMusic described the song as a \"superb epic\" which deals with \"mankind's inability to live harmoniously\".\n\"Innuendo\" was pieced together \"like a jigsaw puzzle\". The recurring theme (with the Bol\u00e9ro-esque beat) started off as a jam session between May, Deacon and Taylor. Mercury then added the melody and some of the lyric, which were then completed by Taylor.\nThe middle section was primarily Mercury's work, according to an interview with May in October 1994's Guitar Magazine. It features a flamenco guitar solo, followed by a classically influenced bridge, and then the solo again but performed with electric guitars. This section is especially complex, featuring a pattern of three bars in 5/4 time (reasonably uncommon in popular music) followed by five bars in the more often used 3/4 time. The end of the flamenco-guitar style is based on the 5/4 bar, but is in 6/4 time.\nThe bridge section (\"You can be anything you want to be\") features sophisticated orchestration, created by Mercury and producer David Richards using the popular Korg M1 keyboard/synth/workstation. Mercury had arranged and co-arranged orchestras in his solo career, and closed the previous Queen album with the track \"Was It All Worth It\", which included a Gershwin-esque interlude also coming from an M1 synth. The Bridge section in \"Innuendo\" is in 3/4, showing once again Mercury's affection for triple metres: \"Bicycle Race\" is another one with main sections in 4/4 and middle-eight in 3/4, and some of his best-known pieces (namely \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Somebody to Love\") were in 6/8, as would be his last composition, \"A Winter's Tale\".\nSteve Howe has said he was \"so proud\" to have played on the song and he became the only Queen non-member to have played guitar on a studio recording of a Queen song. Howe and Mercury had been friends for several years, since they ran into each other quite often at the Townhouse Studios in London. Yes had recorded Going for the One at Mountain Studios in 1976\u201377 shortly before Queen bought the Swiss studio, and Asia's debut album was produced by Queen's engineer, Mike Stone.\nOn a break from a recording session in Geneva, Howe drove to Montreux and stopped to have lunch. There he ran into Martin Groves, who had worked for Yes before and by this time was Queen's equipment supervisor. Groves told him Queen were in the studio at the moment.\nAs soon as Steve Howe went into the studios, Mercury asked him to play some guitar (according to producer David Richards, who had worked with Yes in the past as well). Another version is that Brian May was the one who asked him to play the flamenco bit. When the members of Queen asked if Howe wanted to play on the title track, Howe politely suggested they\u2019d lost their minds. It took the combined weight of Mercury, May and Taylor to persuade him.\nAccording to Steve Howe:\nInside, there\u2019s Freddie, Brian and Roger all sitting together. They go: \u2018Let\u2019s play you the album\u2019. Of course, I\u2019m hearing it"

It was written by Williams and Gary Barlow, sampling a riff from \"Eurodans\" by Terje Olsen. The song was Williams's first UK number-one single since \"Radio\" in 2004, and was deliberately produced in the style of other 2012 chart-toppers in a calculated attempt to re-establish his presence in the UK charts.\nThe track premiered on BBC Radio 1 just days before the station removed Williams from their playlist, deeming him no longer relevant to their target audience. Williams claimed to be gutted by the decision, citing Radio 1 as a pop star's \"main oxygen\". When the song reached number one without Radio 1 airplay, the singer thanked the station, who \"have supported me for a long, long time and I'm very grateful to them. Oh, and I can still have number ones without them!\"\nThe track was originally rumoured to be titled \"Vertigo\". Williams said of the track: \"It's a summer song, very much in a similar vein to 'Rock DJ', about a girl who thinks she's great. And she might be, but she's a bit nefarious with her ways. Some songs take an age to write and some songs just fall out of your mouth completely formed, and you don't have to think about it. I don't know why that fell out of my mouth and out of my brain at that particular time \u2013 it just did.\" On 10 September, Williams debuted \"Candy\" on Radio 2's Breakfast Show with host Chris Evans. The official artwork for the track features a model of Williams's head covered in pink and red spots.\n\"Candy\" was written by Robbie Williams, Gary Barlow and Terje Olsen, while production was handled by Jacknife Lee. The song samples Norwegian producer Todd Terje\u2018s single \"Eurodans\". In the hook, he uses nursery rhymes about the plague (Ring a Ring o\u2019 Roses) and taxes. \"Hey ho here she goes/ Either a little too high or a little too low/ Got no self-esteem and vertigo/ Cause she thinks she's made of candy,\" Williams chants on the chorus. The song contains melodic elements of the nursery rhyme Ring a Ring o' Roses and even contains the title of the rhyme at the start of the second verse.\n\nLewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song 4 out of 5 stars, writing that \"'Candy' doesn't touch the dizzying heights of 'Rock DJ' or 'Angels', but it's also far from his worst song to date.\" Corner also wrote: \"Robbie chants on a bouncy, playground chant of a chorus brassier than his stage persona \u2013 and there within lies the charm.\" John Bush of AllMusic wrote that \"The trailer single 'Candy' is a trite, uptempo track with a sing-song chorus but not much of a shelf life, it's the perfect radio hit.\" Sam Lanksy of Idolator wrote the song \"is sprightly and spunky with a clever hook \u2014 arguably the best sweets-related diss since Annie's 'Chewing Gum'.\" Tom Hocknell of BBC Music called it \"catchier than Velcro, although it\u2019s unclear why anyone needs to own it \u2013 after the second listen it owns you. It\u2019s eager to please, certainly.\"\nAlexis Petridis of The Guardian was less positive, writing that \"[...] It's so desperate to be a smash hit that it ends up sounding like one of those novelty singles that used to blight the September charts, bought by returning holidaymakers with rosy memories of the hotel disco; all it's lacking is an accompanying dance.\" Philip Matusavage of musicOMH also gave the song a mixed review, writing that \"It's a neat pr\u00e9cis of the problems facing Robbie in 2012. Its bouncy dancehall brass is undeniably and infectiously catchy but it\u2019s also short-lived; the song leaves no impression at its end.\" Kitty Empire of The Observer observed that \"it would better suit a boy band in a Caribbean time warp. But somehow, it looks as if it will re-establish Williams's presence in the charts today, regardless.\"\nIn Germany, \"Candy\" broke an airplay record for the most plays in a week. It peaked at number 3 on the main chart. In Austria, the song was a success, debuting and peaking, for three consecutive weeks, at number 4 on the \u00d63 Austria Top 40 chart. \"Candy\" was a growing success in the Netherlands, debuting at number 27 on the Dutch Top 40 chart. After six weeks climbing the charts, the song entered the top-ten, reaching number 6, on 10 November 2012. In the Dutch Mega Top 100 \"Candy\" reached number 1 on 17 November 2012. It reached top 10 in more than 20 countries, and Top 40 in other territories including Japan and New Zealand.\nIn his native UK, despite BBC Radio 1 not putting it on their playlist, \"Candy\" gathered over 10,000"

It was composed by drummer Peter Criss, his friend Stan Penridge and producer Bob Ezrin. Casablanca Records released it as a single in August 1976, after it was released as the B-side of \"Detroit Rock City\". \"Beth\" is Kiss's biggest commercial hit in the United States; it reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100, received a Gold Record certification from the RIAA, and won the 1977 People's Choice Award for \"Favorite Song\". In 2003, \"Beth\" ranked #3 in VH1's 25 Greatest Power Ballads.\nThe song, originally titled \"Beck\", was composed by Criss and Penridge during their time with the band Chelsea. During the recording of Destroyer, Criss showed it to Ezrin, who made several changes to it and recommended changing its title to \"Beth\". \"Beth\" has appeared on several compilations and live albums, including Kiss Unplugged (1996), where the group performed it acoustically.\nBy 1975, Kiss had released three studio albums, in which the compositional contributions of drummer Peter Criss were minimal; the only track on which he appeared credited was the instrumental track \"Love Theme from Kiss\", written by the four members of the band and included in their debut album. Criss assumed the role of vocalist in other songs created by his bandmates; however, for Destroyer, Criss set himself the goal of adding one of his own compositions. During a limousine ride, Criss sang a fast-paced version of \"Beck\" for bassist Gene Simmons and guitarist Paul Stanley, assuming they would not be interested in including a sentimental ballad on the album. Simmons and Stanley suggested that he sing it to producer Bob Ezrin, who agreed to record it and assured him that it would be a success.\nDuring Criss's time in Chelsea, he and the group's guitarist Stan Penridge decided to write a mocking song about the wife of their bandmate Mike Brand, Becky. According to Criss, she regularly called the group during rehearsals to ask when her husband would come home, and this gave them the idea of composing the first verse of the song: \"Beck, I hear you callin', but I can't come home right now. Me and the boys are playin', and we just can't find the sound\". Criss later admitted that he composed the song for his first wife, Lydia.\nCriss sang the song to Bob Ezrin, who decided to include it in Destroyer because Kiss' other songs were primarily about sex, and \"Beck\" was a love song that \"everyone would relate to\". Ezrin made several arrangements of the song's melody and wrote part of the lyrics. Gene Simmons suggested changing the name to \"Beth\" because it would be easier to sing and to avoid confusion with Jeff Beck. However, Lydia Criss later claimed credit for proposing the change for the same reason, and because the original Becky had a twin sister named Beth.\nIn his autobiography, Simmons recounted that \"I have never seen [Criss] compose a single song. Peter might have contributed a line or two of the lyrics, but after listening to Penridge's original demo, it's clear who made the original song\". In 2014, during an interview for Rolling Stone, Paul Stanley agreed with Simmons's assessment that Penridge was the main author, and he commented that Criss had nothing to do with the composition of \"Beth\", adding that \"if you write one hit, you should be able to write two\". Criss, in his defense, mentioned that Stanley was jealous because \"he is the main vocalist of a group in which he did not write the greatest success. That's his problem. They hate the fact that I was the songwriter of a hit and won the People's Choice\".\nFor the song's recording, Ezrin brought the New York Philharmonic orchestra and musician Dick Wagner into the A&R studio as a substitute for Ace Frehley. According to Criss and Simmons, Frehley did not participate in the recording because he was engaged in playing cards with friends. Once the orchestra arrived at the studio, Ezrin suggested that all 25 members wear fake tuxedos and that Criss appear in the studio in his trademark makeup so he could take some pictures. For his part, Ezrin put on a top hat and played the grand piano. Finally, Criss recorded the vocals at the Record Plant studio.\nStructurally, \"Beth\" lacks a solo; instead, the mid-octave section repeats the intro along with the chorus in an orchestral interlude. The sound of the violin and viola, led by the cello, change the key from C major to A minor and then the trumpets, tubas, trombones and French horns enter, accentuating the hook.\nThe song was a last-minute addition to"

Written by Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor but credited to Queen, it is the opening track on the album of the same name, and was released as the first single from the album. The single debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart in January 1991, the band's first number-one hit since \"Under Pressure\" in 1981, and additionally reached the top ten in ten other countries. It is included on the band's second compilation album Greatest Hits II.\nAt six-and-a-half minutes, it is one of Queen's epic songs. The song has been described as \"reminiscent\" of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" because it was \"harking back to their progressive rock roots\". It features  a flamenco guitar section performed by Yes guitarist Steve Howe and Brian May, an operatic interlude and sections of hard rock that recall early Queen, in addition to the lyric inspired in part by Mercury's illness; although media stories about his health were being denied strenuously, he was by now seriously ill with AIDS, which would claim his life in November 1991, 10 months after the song was released.\nThe song was accompanied by a music video featuring animated representations of the band on a cinema screen akin to Nineteen Eighty-Four, eerie plasticine figure stop-motion and harrowing imagery. It has been described as one of the band's darkest and most moving works. AllMusic described the song as a \"superb epic\" which deals with \"mankind's inability to live harmoniously\".\n\"Innuendo\" was pieced together \"like a jigsaw puzzle\". The recurring theme (with the Bol\u00e9ro-esque beat) started off as a jam session between May, Deacon and Taylor. Mercury then added the melody and some of the lyric, which were then completed by Taylor.\nThe middle section was primarily Mercury's work, according to an interview with May in October 1994's Guitar Magazine. It features a flamenco guitar solo, followed by a classically influenced bridge, and then the solo again but performed with electric guitars. This section is especially complex, featuring a pattern of three bars in 5/4 time (reasonably uncommon in popular music) followed by five bars in the more often used 3/4 time. The end of the flamenco-guitar style is based on the 5/4 bar, but is in 6/4 time.\nThe bridge section (\"You can be anything you want to be\") features sophisticated orchestration, created by Mercury and producer David Richards using the popular Korg M1 keyboard/synth/workstation. Mercury had arranged and co-arranged orchestras in his solo career, and closed the previous Queen album with the track \"Was It All Worth It\", which included a Gershwin-esque interlude also coming from an M1 synth. The Bridge section in \"Innuendo\" is in 3/4, showing once again Mercury's affection for triple metres: \"Bicycle Race\" is another one with main sections in 4/4 and middle-eight in 3/4, and some of his best-known pieces (namely \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Somebody to Love\") were in 6/8, as would be his last composition, \"A Winter's Tale\".\nSteve Howe has said he was \"so proud\" to have played on the song and he became the only Queen non-member to have played guitar on a studio recording of a Queen song. Howe and Mercury had been friends for several years, since they ran into each other quite often at the Townhouse Studios in London. Yes had recorded Going for the One at Mountain Studios in 1976\u201377 shortly before Queen bought the Swiss studio, and Asia's debut album was produced by Queen's engineer, Mike Stone.\nOn a break from a recording session in Geneva, Howe drove to Montreux and stopped to have lunch. There he ran into Martin Groves, who had worked for Yes before and by this time was Queen's equipment supervisor. Groves told him Queen were in the studio at the moment.\nAs soon as Steve Howe went into the studios, Mercury asked him to play some guitar (according to producer David Richards, who had worked with Yes in the past as well). Another version is that Brian May was the one who asked him to play the flamenco bit. When the members of Queen asked if Howe wanted to play on the title track, Howe politely suggested they\u2019d lost their minds. It took the combined weight of Mercury, May and Taylor to persuade him.\nAccording to Steve Howe:\nInside, there\u2019s Freddie, Brian and Roger all sitting together. They go: \u2018Let\u2019s play you the album\u2019. Of course, I\u2019m hearing it"

It was released in December 2003 as a double A-side with \"My Lover's Prayer\", a duet with Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees and reached number five on the UK Singles Chart.\n\"Bring It On\" had been written several years before when Griffin had been an unsigned artist working in Germany. It had already been showcased live on the BBC Fame Academy programme, prompting Richard Park to comment: \"the acid test is always if a song gets into your brain, and I have to confess Alistair, that one has got into my brain.\"\nGriffin had been signed to UMTV, a division of Universal, soon after the programme ended in October 2003 and the label announced shortly afterwards that \"Bring It On\" was to be his debut single, with a November release date.\n\"My Lover's Prayer\" (titled \"A Lover's Prayer\" on the cover of the limited edition single) was originally recorded by the Bee Gees, and appeared on their 1997 album Still Waters. Robin Gibb had intended to re-release the song as a solo single in 2003 with backing vocals by Lance Bass and Wanya Morris, and a promo version of this had already been given radio play.  However, the morning after the Fame Academy 2 final, Gibb contacted Griffin with a request to re-record a duet of the song, with the apparent intention of releasing it as a Christmas single. This version also used Robin's original vocals with a new remix of the instrumental track. Three other performers from Fame Academy 2, Peter Brame, Carolynne Good and winner Alex Parks sang the backing vocals.\nInitially announced as two separate releases, the dates of both singles were unaccountably delayed until after Christmas 2003, when \"Bring It On\" was eventually released as a double A-side with \"My Lover's Prayer\" (the latter credited as Alistair Griffin feat. Robin Gibb) on 29 December, entering the UK Singles Chart at number five the following week.\nMany fans were disappointed with the poor production quality and the generic 'pop' treatment of the recorded version of \"Bring It On\", preferring the live version previously seen on TV. Reviewers also criticised it as being too bland. The duet, which was separately produced, was generally well received, but was not popular with music critics.\nAlthough given extensive live promotion, \"Bring It On\" was not playlisted on any of the national radio networks, fulfilling Richard Park's prediction that Griffin would not get radio play on any of his Emap stations. Following the controversy over Fame Academy, and in what appeared to be a general backlash against reality TV performers, \"Bring It On\" was not aired on any of the BBC's programmes other than the Sunday evening chart show after it had charted in the United Kingdom.\n\"My Lover's Prayer\" was included on Radio 2's B playlist for a short time.\nThe video for \"Bring It On\" was a tribute to the cult Channel 4 television programme Phoenix Nights, starring Peter Kay. Made by Flynn Productions, directed by Craig Pickles and produced by Charlotte Woodhead, it was set in a stereotypical Northern England working men's club, the singer was first shown alone on stage, playing to a deserted concert hall which was empty except for two old ladies playing Patience. The scene then changed to a dream scenario of a Top of the Pops type performance, with a full backing band and an enthusiastic audience of teenage girls. At the end of the song, the scene switched back again to the seedy concert hall where the singer was shown looking ruefully around him, and then walking off stage. A number of critics appeared to be unaware of the visual references, and remarked on the video's cheap appearance.\n\"Bring It On\" was voted number one for six consecutive weeks on the UK music video channel The Box.\nTwo separate videos were made for \"My Lover's Prayer\", the first featured Alistair Griffin acting out a romantic scenario with a girl, the second showed Robin Gibb and Griffin in the recording studio. Neither video was included on the CD singles, and neither was ever released to the music stations. Clips from the second have appeared on several TV programmes and the full version can be viewed on Robin Gibb's official Myspace page.\nTwo different versions of the single were released, both chart eligible. The extended single also included a cover of Take That's \"Back for Good\" and a video. The artwork for the limited edition single cover featured a dramatic portrait of Robin Gibb with Alistair Griffin.\nExtended single (CD1)\n\"Bring It On\" (3.03)\n\"My Lover's Prayer\""

It was composed principally by Paul McCartney, with the middle eight co-written with John Lennon. The song is a love ballad with part of its lyrics sung in French.\nFollowing its inclusion on Rubber Soul, the song was released as a single in some European countries and in New Zealand, and on an EP in France, in early 1966. It was a number 1 hit for the Beatles in Belgium, France, Norway, the Netherlands and New Zealand. Concurrent recordings of the song by David and Jonathan and the Overlanders were similarly successful in North America and Britain, respectively. \"Michelle\" won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1967 and has since become one of the most widely recorded of all Beatles songs.\nThe instrumental music of \"Michelle\" originated separately from the lyrical concept. According to McCartney:\n\"Michelle\" was a tune that I'd written in Chet Atkins' finger-picking style. There is a song he did called \"Trambone\" with a repetitive top line, and he played a bass line while playing a melody.  This was an innovation for us; even though classical guitarists had played it, no rock 'n' roll guitarists had played it. The first person we knew to use finger-picking style was Chet Atkins ... I never learned it. But based on Atkins' \"Trambone\", I wanted to write something with a melody and a bass line in it, so I did. I just had it as an instrumental in C.\nThe words and style of \"Michelle\" have their origins in the popularity of Parisian Left Bank culture during McCartney's Liverpool days. In his description, \"it was at the time of people like Juliette Greco, the French bohemian thing.\" McCartney had gone to a party of art students where a student with a goatee and a striped T-shirt was singing a French song. He soon wrote a farcical imitation to entertain his friends that involved French-sounding groaning instead of real words. The song remained a party piece until 1965, when John Lennon suggested he rework it into a proper song for inclusion on Rubber Soul.\nMcCartney asked Jan Vaughan, a French teacher and the wife of his old friend Ivan Vaughan, to come up with a French name and a phrase that rhymed with it. McCartney said: \"It was because I'd always thought that the song sounded French that I stuck with it. I can't speak French properly so that's why I needed help in sorting out the actual words.\"\nVaughan came up with \"Michelle, ma belle\", and a few days later McCartney asked for a translation of \"these are words that go together well\", rendered incorrectly as: sont les mots qui vont tr\u00e8s bien ensemble. When McCartney played the song for Lennon, Lennon suggested the \"I love you\" bridge. Lennon was inspired by a song he heard the previous evening, Nina Simone's version of \"I Put a Spell on You\", which used the same phrase but with the emphasis on the last word, \"I love you\".\nEach version of this song has a different length. The UK mono mix is 2:33 whereas the stereo version extends to 2:40 and the US mono is 2:43. The version available in The Beatles: Rock Band has a running time of 2:50.\nThe song was initially composed in C, but was played in F on Rubber Soul (with a capo on the fifth fret). The verse opens with an F major chord (\"Michelle\" \u2013 melody note C) then the second chord (on \"ma belle\" \u2013 melody note D\u266d) is a B\u266d\u2077\u266f\u2079 (on the original demo in C, the second chord is a F\u2077\u266f\u2079). McCartney called this second chord a \"great ham-fisted jazz chord\" that was taught to them by Jim Gretty who worked at Hessey's music shop in Whitechapel, central Liverpool and which George Harrison uses (as a G\u266d\u2077\u266f\u2079) (see Dominant seventh sharp ninth chord) as the penultimate chord of his solo on \"Till There Was You\". After the E\u266d\u2076 (of \"these are words\") there follows an ascent involving different inversions of the D dim chord. These progress from A\u266ddim on \"go\" \u2013 melody note F, bass note D; to Bdim (C\u266ddim) on \"to\" \u2013 melody note A\u266d, bass note D; to Ddim on \"ge ...\" \u2013 melody note B (C\u266d) bass note B; to Bdim on ... 'ther ...\" \u2013 melody note A\u266d bass note B, till the dominant (V) chord (C major) is reached on \"well\" \u2013 melody note G bass note C.\nGeorge Martin, the Beatles' producer, recalled that he composed the melody of the guitar solo, which is heard midway through the song and again during the fadeout. He showed Harrison the notes during the recording session and then accompanied the guitarist (on piano, out of microphone range) when the solos were overdubbed. In terms of its complementary role to the main melody, musicologist Walter Everett likens this guitar part to two musical passages that Martin had"

Robin Gibb) on 29 December, entering the UK Singles Chart at number five the following week.\nMany fans were disappointed with the poor production quality and the generic 'pop' treatment of the recorded version of \"Bring It On\", preferring the live version previously seen on TV. Reviewers also criticised it as being too bland. The duet, which was separately produced, was generally well received, but was not popular with music critics.\nAlthough given extensive live promotion, \"Bring It On\" was not playlisted on any of the national radio networks, fulfilling Richard Park's prediction that Griffin would not get radio play on any of his Emap stations. Following the controversy over Fame Academy, and in what appeared to be a general backlash against reality TV performers, \"Bring It On\" was not aired on any of the BBC's programmes other than the Sunday evening chart show after it had charted in the United Kingdom.\n\"My Lover's Prayer\" was included on Radio 2's B playlist for a short time.\nThe video for \"Bring It On\" was a tribute to the cult Channel 4 television programme Phoenix Nights, starring Peter Kay. Made by Flynn Productions, directed by Craig Pickles and produced by Charlotte Woodhead, it was set in a stereotypical Northern England working men's club, the singer was first shown alone on stage, playing to a deserted concert hall which was empty except for two old ladies playing Patience. The scene then changed to a dream scenario of a Top of the Pops type performance, with a full backing band and an enthusiastic audience of teenage girls. At the end of the song, the scene switched back again to the seedy concert hall where the singer was shown looking ruefully around him, and then walking off stage. A number of critics appeared to be unaware of the visual references, and remarked on the video's cheap appearance.\n\"Bring It On\" was voted number one for six consecutive weeks on the UK music video channel The Box.\nTwo separate videos were made for \"My Lover's Prayer\", the first featured Alistair Griffin acting out a romantic scenario with a girl, the second showed Robin Gibb and Griffin in the recording studio. Neither video was included on the CD singles, and neither was ever released to the music stations. Clips from the second have appeared on several TV programmes and the full version can be viewed on Robin Gibb's official Myspace page.\nTwo different versions of the single were released, both chart eligible. The extended single also included a cover of Take That's \"Back for Good\" and a video. The artwork for the limited edition single cover featured a dramatic portrait of Robin Gibb with Alistair Griffin.\nExtended single (CD1)\n\"Bring It On\" (3.03)\n\"My Lover's Prayer\""

It was released on 19 June 2000 as the lead single from the duo's self-titled debut studio album. It became a major worldwide success, topping at least 10 music charts, including the national charts of Ireland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. It also topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart in January 2001.\nThe song is written in B flat minor; there is also an acoustic version recorded in G minor. It features a guitar sample of \"Soup for One\" performed by Chic, as written by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. In 2011, Chic added the song to their concert setlist, which is performed as a mash-up song with \"Soup for One\".\nThe single includes the original version of the track, plus an acoustic version, both performed by Modjo. Remixes have been provided by Harry Romero, Roy Davis, Jr. and Danny Tenaglia.\nThe song debuted at number one in the United Kingdom on 10 September 2000, where it stayed for two weeks to become the sixteenth best-selling single of 2000. It also reached number one in seven other European countries and became a top-ten hit in several others, as well as in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. In the United States, the song peaked at number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. As of 2017, the single has sold two million copies worldwide.\nDaily Record wrote that it is a \"brilliant\" house track. Australian music channel Max placed the song at number 790 in their list of the \"1000 Greatest Songs of All Time\" in 2012. Mixmag included \"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" in their list of \"The 30 Best Vocal House Anthems Ever\" in 2018. Insider put the song on their list of the \"102 Songs Everyone Should Listen to in Their Lifetime\" in 2019.\nThe music video for the song was directed by Fran\u00e7ois Nemeta and was filmed in June 2000 in various locations in Quebec, Canada.\nThe video details the various shenanigans of three teenagers, one girl and two boys. The video starts off with a boy with a shaved head who walks into a restaurant to meet the other two. The three then pool all their money together. They make it to a used car dealership, where they buy a car and drive it to a country fair. The three watch a band playing in a bar and then grab their instruments during a break. Their efforts aren't appreciated, and the teenager with the shaved head is hit with a bottle thrown from the crowd, after which they are chased out. They then sneak into a motel, where they proceed to sing and dance while in the shower, all while still clothed. The boy with the shaved head imagines that he is alone with the girl in an exotic location. The next morning, they are chased out by the hotel manager, and they make their escape until their car breaks down. The girl leads the boys into the woods, and they come across a cliff with a view of the city, which they gaze at in awe.

The song was written by Cardi B with its producer J. White Did It. Its music video features Cardi playing characters in different locations, including in an art museum, a bank and a strip club. Cardi performed the song at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, alongside the \"Money Bag\" instrumental. The song and its music video received acclaim and accolades including Best Hip Hop Video at both the 2019 BET Hip Hop Awards and the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards and a Rhythm & Bars Award at the 2019 Soul Train Music Awards. \"Money\" was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nOn October 22, 2018, Cardi B announced that the single would be released the following Thursday. However, the song was released two days earlier due to a leak. The single's artwork features Cardi posing in gloves composed of gold watches and a gilded, chain-fringed hat.\n\"Money\" is a New York hip hop number, with Cardi performing over a stripped-down hip hop drum beat, bass tones and piano notes. Lyrically, it celebrates financial stability.\nWriting for Rolling Stone, Jon Blistein commented \"Money\" \"boasts a stomping yet simple beat built around spitfire trap drums and stark piano strikes. Cardi rides the beat with characteristic aplomb, switching flows with ease as she unravels an array of punchlines and another instantly memorable hook.\" Carl Lamarre of Billboard opined the song \"finds Cardi dashing back to her mixtape roots, flexing a steely flow over a thunderous beat.\" Tom Breihan of Stereogum wrote, \"this is exactly the sort of song that Cardi B should be making right now. It's tough and immediate, and it projects the same larger-than-life sneer that made Cardi sound like such a revelation on 'Bodak Yellow' more than a year ago.\" Stephen Kearse of Pitchfork deemed the track \"familiar yet fun,\" and added, \"Cardi remains a direct and parsimonious writer, paring ideas down to their essence.\" Complex listed the song among the week's best releases, with editor Carolyn Bernucca praising the lyrics.\n\nIn early December 2018, Cardi teased the music video on her social media pages, sharing a behind-the-scenes look at her outfit, a leotard and headpiece made of gold watches. The Jora Frantzis-directed video premiered on December 21, 2018.\nThe music video opens with a dancer swinging hypnotically around an invisible pole. Cardi makes her first appearance in a black and white dress, which she wears with a futuristic-inspired, halo-like headpiece in an old-world style room. She is surrounded by a group of women in garter belts, black fascinators and open blazers baring nipples. Cardi then appears as a statue in a glass case, being gawked at by wealthy attendees. The glass case is surrounded by several of her previous outfits on display. She also portrays a nude piano player and a breastfeeding mother in couture. In the following scene, a team of women take over the bank, as Cardi appears in a jewel-covered string bikini in a vault. The scene then moves to the strip club, with the rapper wearing a black leather corset showing off some moves on the pole and dollars flying all around her. She also makes an appearance as part of the audience in the club, wearing a massive version of a slanted hat.\nThe looks in the old-world style room scene and in the bank vault were inspired by Thierry Mugler's 1999 Playboy photo shoot and Lil' Kim's look at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, respectively. As of June 2020, the age-restricted video has garnered more than 100 million views, while the audio has accumulated more than 200 million views.\nIn Rolling Stone, Charles Holmes opined that the video \"is a monument to celebration and opulent overload [...] The metaphors aren't subtle.

It is the opening track on their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004). It was released to radio as the album's lead single on 8 November 2004, and upon release, it received extensive airplay. The song was an international success, bolstered by its usage in a television advertisement featuring the band for Apple's iPod digital music player. The song lent its name to the band's 2005\u20132006 Vertigo Tour.\nIn the United States, \"Vertigo\" peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Alternative Songs chart. It topped the singles charts in Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom while reaching the top 10 in Australia, Austria, Belgium (Wallonia), Canada, Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. \"Vertigo\" won three Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, Best Rock Song, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony in 2005.\n\"Vertigo\" was ranked 64th on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of the Decade (2000 to 2010).\n\"Vertigo\" originated from a demo that guitarist the Edge composed at his home in Malibu on a \"very simple Pro-Tools rig\". Playing along to drum loops that drummer Larry Mullen Jr. had recorded for him, the Edge created the guitar riff among others while \"exploring rock 'n' roll guitar\" and \"what that means in the twenty-first century\". Inspiration for the riff came within 20 minutes of the Edge first plugging into a 1957 Fender Deluxe amplifier, which was acquired for him by his technician Dallas Schoo after he requested a small amplifier he could use to record demos at his home studio. The Edge gave the demo a working title of \"Full Metal Jacket\". When lead singer Bono heard it, he was very enthused, describing it as: \"the mother of all rock 'n' roll tunes. I don't know where it came from but it's a remarkable guitar thing. You want to hear it \u2013 it's a reason to make a record. The song is that good!\" Believing that their pending record would have a punk rock energy and be very collaborative between the band members, U2 hired Chris Thomas to produce it; the Edge said that he worked well with bands and had produced several records that were favourites among U2, including early Roxy Music albums and the Sex Pistols's Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols. U2 began working with Thomas on the album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb in February 2003. During the sessions, U2 experimented with different melodies and rhythm ideas for \"Full Metal Jacket\". Bono's original set of lyrics was inspired by Leonard Peltier, a Native American rights activist who was controversially convicted of killing two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. Bono did not believe Peltier deserved to be imprisoned, and he took a \"new-journalism approach\" to writing the lyrics. The song was subsequently retitled \"Native Son\", and after extensive experimentation on it, the band recorded and mixed a version of the song to completion with Thomas. The group were so excited by the song, they sent it to Interscope Records, which was equally excited by it. However, Bono called the decision a mistake and said the song ultimately \"wasn't as good as [they] thought\".\nAfter working for nine months with Thomas, U2 had recorded an album's worth of material, but they were dissatisfied with the quality of it and decided to delay the release. As a result, they hired producer Steve Lillywhite to replace Thomas in January 2004. Lillywhite urged the band to record in the larger space at Hanover Quay Studio to encourage better performances. While Bono was away for the week, the band re-recorded the backing track for \"Native Son\". When Bono returned, Lillywhite asked him to record a guide vocal, but 30 seconds into a take, Bono stopped, as he became uncomfortable with the thought of singing the lyrics to a large crowd in a live setting. He said: \"The lyrics were about something I care deeply about, but the song didn't vibrate. It didn't change the room temperature.\" The song subsequently was deconstructed and the lyrics were changed around, with various iterations of the song being called \"Shark Soup\" and \"Viva la Ramone\". At one point, Bono wrote a completely new set of lyrics in Spanish, remnants of which would survive in the completed version"

The song features vocals by singer T-Pain and was produced by West and DJ Toomp. It is a hip hop song that contains a sample of the keyboard outro to \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\" performed by Michael Jackson. The song features additional drum programming by Timbaland and additional production by Mike Dean, as well as background vocals by John Legend and Ne-Yo.\nThe song's lyrics see West celebrating the finer things in life and acknowledging his success. \"Good Life\" peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and number twenty-three on the UK Singles Chart. The music video was premiered on MTV Jams on September 11, 2007. The song earned two nominations at the 50th Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, winning the latter. It was nominated for Best Collaboration and Video of the Year at the 2008 BET Awards, managing to win the former.\nThe song samples the keyboard outro of the single \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\" performed by Michael Jackson, combined with layers of synths from Omar Edwards. Producer DJ Toomp revealed that the song's creation started off with West playing with the sample and being like: \"Yo, I always wanted to do something with this... I want to hear it in a different key\" and Toomp played with the sample as well. John Legend and Ne-Yo sing the final refrains of \"Good Life\". The lyrics focus on life being good and West celebrates his success. West spins lyrics from 50 Cent's single \"In Da Club\" that originally were about Lloyd Banks giving 50 advice to being about 50 giving West advice instead. It was revealed by T-Pain that even though he recorded multiple different hooks, none of them sounded right to West and he ended up making the hook out of a composite that was made up of all the hooks that had been recorded by T-Pain. Working on the track in the studio was viewed as feeling like a party by Toomp and he also said that there was a lot of the GOOD Music crew in the studio for it.\nIn a 2019 interview with Revolt, DJ Toomp commented on the creation of the song;\n\"Kanye came with the sample and I started making the beat around it. We wanted a professional keyboardist to bless that shit. John Legend was singing on the hook in one version. We went through about four different artists before we decided T-Pain was going to do the hook. Watching him go through so many different artists and different hooks, I learned about taking your time and not settling with what you hear the first time.\"\nThe music video for \"Good Life\" was directed by Jonas & Fran\u00e7ois with animation by So-Me. The video premiered on September 11, 2007 as MTV Jams' \"Jam of the Week\". It features West and T-Pain performing with animated backdrops on a white background and often mouthing the words of the song lyrics, which appear in large letters. The version of the song used in the video contains an additional twenty-four seconds that the album version does not have. The music video features a cameo from rapper/model LoLa Monroe. On set, West had to persuade T-Pain to listen to \"Good Life\" again before the shooting began.\n\"Good Life\" debuted at number sixty-three on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs during the chart week of September 22, 2007, where it eventually peaked at number three, becoming West's second top ten single from Graduation on the chart. For the chart week of September 29, 2007, \"Good Life\" was the \"Hot Shot Debut\" of the week on the Billboard Hot 100, as it entered at number fourteen due to strong digital downloads. The song climbed to the seventh position, becoming West's second consecutive top ten Hot 100 single from Graduation as well as T-Pain's sixth top ten single. \"Good Life\" debuted on the Canadian Hot 100 at number thirty-nine and has peaked at number twenty-three. The single generated a strong reaction from the MuchMusic Countdown, where it reached number-one. \"Good Life\" was able to reach number thirty-three on the UK Singles Chart before it was officially released in the UK until November 5, 2007. Upon its release, the single was able to rise and peak at the twenty-third position on the chart.\n\"Good Life\" received a total of 13 nominations for music awards and ultimately won eight of them. Among the awards won by the song were Best Collaboration at the 2008 BET Awards,"

Starr co-wrote it with George Harrison, his former bandmate from the Beatles. Although they collaborated on other songs, it is the only one officially credited to the pair. A signature tune for Starr as a solo artist, \"Photograph\" was an international hit, topping singles charts in the United States, Canada and Australia, and receiving gold disc certification for US sales of 1 million. Music critics have similarly received the song favourably; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considers it to be \"among the very best post-Beatles songs by any of the Fab Four\".\nThe lyrics are a reflection on lost love, whereby a photograph is the only reminder of the protagonists' shared past. Starr and Harrison began writing the song in the South of France in 1971, during a period when Starr was focused on developing his acting career. They first recorded \"Photograph\" late the following year, along with the single's B-side, \"Down and Out\", during the sessions for Harrison's Living in the Material World album. The officially released version was recorded in Los Angeles with producer Richard Perry. It incorporates aspects of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound through the presence of multiple drums and acoustic guitars, as well as an orchestra and a choir. Aside from Starr and Harrison, the musicians on the recording include Nicky Hopkins, Bobby Keys, Jim Keltner, and Spector's musical arranger, Jack Nitzsche. Starr made a promotional film for the single, shot at his and wife Maureen Starkey's home, Tittenhurst Park.\n\"Photograph\" has appeared on Starr's compilation albums Blast from Your Past and Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr, and live versions have featured on releases recorded with his All-Starr Band and with the Roundheads. In November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, Starr sang \"Photograph\" at the Concert for George \u2013 a performance that was an emotional highpoint of the event. Engelbert Humperdinck, Camper Van Beethoven, Cilla Black and Adam Sandler are among the artists who have covered the song.\nEx-Beatles Ringo Starr and George Harrison began writing \"Photograph\" on a luxury yacht in the South of France in May 1971. Starr had hired a yacht, the Marala, for the duration of the Cannes Film Festival, after attending Mick Jagger's wedding in St Tropez with his wife, Maureen Starkey. The Starkeys were then joined in France by Harrison and the latter's wife, Pattie Boyd, for the Monaco Grand Prix. This period coincided with Starr's first success as a solo artist, with the Harrison-produced single \"It Don't Come Easy\", although he continued to focus on his career as a film actor, beginning with a role in Blindman (1971).\nAnother guest on the Marala was Cilla Black, singer and a friend of the Beatles since the 1960s. She recalled Starr and Harrison playing \"Photograph\" during an evening get-together, with \"everyone on board\" contributing ideas for the lyrics. As with Starr's two singles over 1971\u201372, \"It Don't Come Easy\" and \"Back Off Boogaloo\", Harrison helped write the melody, although \"Photograph\" marked the first time that he was credited as a co-writer with Starr. In her autobiography, Step Inside Love, Black says she had hoped to record the song for a single later in 1971, only to be told by Starr: \"No, it's too bloody good for you. I'm having it myself.\"\nThe lyrics to \"Photograph\" are centred around lost love, with the singer having only a single picture by which to remember his absent lover. The photograph reminds him of their former happiness together, while also enforcing the reality that \"you're not coming back any more\". Author Ian Inglis comments on the familiar subject matter in the conventions of pop songwriting, but identifies an atypical aspect in the lyrics' \"absence of any hope that love might be rekindled\". Starr expresses resignation at what the future holds, in the lines \"Now you're expecting me to live without you / But that's not something that I'm looking forward to\".\nThe song is in the key of E, with what Inglis terms an \"easy melody\" that allows for Starr's limitations as a singer. According to authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler, Harrison's \"distinctive composing style\" is particularly evident. Starr"

The song was written by Cardi B with its producer J. White Did It. Its music video features Cardi playing characters in different locations, including in an art museum, a bank and a strip club. Cardi performed the song at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, alongside the \"Money Bag\" instrumental. The song and its music video received acclaim and accolades including Best Hip Hop Video at both the 2019 BET Hip Hop Awards and the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards and a Rhythm & Bars Award at the 2019 Soul Train Music Awards. \"Money\" was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nOn October 22, 2018, Cardi B announced that the single would be released the following Thursday. However, the song was released two days earlier due to a leak. The single's artwork features Cardi posing in gloves composed of gold watches and a gilded, chain-fringed hat.\n\"Money\" is a New York hip hop number, with Cardi performing over a stripped-down hip hop drum beat, bass tones and piano notes. Lyrically, it celebrates financial stability.\nWriting for Rolling Stone, Jon Blistein commented \"Money\" \"boasts a stomping yet simple beat built around spitfire trap drums and stark piano strikes. Cardi rides the beat with characteristic aplomb, switching flows with ease as she unravels an array of punchlines and another instantly memorable hook.\" Carl Lamarre of Billboard opined the song \"finds Cardi dashing back to her mixtape roots, flexing a steely flow over a thunderous beat.\" Tom Breihan of Stereogum wrote, \"this is exactly the sort of song that Cardi B should be making right now. It's tough and immediate, and it projects the same larger-than-life sneer that made Cardi sound like such a revelation on 'Bodak Yellow' more than a year ago.\" Stephen Kearse of Pitchfork deemed the track \"familiar yet fun,\" and added, \"Cardi remains a direct and parsimonious writer, paring ideas down to their essence.\" Complex listed the song among the week's best releases, with editor Carolyn Bernucca praising the lyrics.\n\nIn early December 2018, Cardi teased the music video on her social media pages, sharing a behind-the-scenes look at her outfit, a leotard and headpiece made of gold watches. The Jora Frantzis-directed video premiered on December 21, 2018.\nThe music video opens with a dancer swinging hypnotically around an invisible pole. Cardi makes her first appearance in a black and white dress, which she wears with a futuristic-inspired, halo-like headpiece in an old-world style room. She is surrounded by a group of women in garter belts, black fascinators and open blazers baring nipples. Cardi then appears as a statue in a glass case, being gawked at by wealthy attendees. The glass case is surrounded by several of her previous outfits on display. She also portrays a nude piano player and a breastfeeding mother in couture. In the following scene, a team of women take over the bank, as Cardi appears in a jewel-covered string bikini in a vault. The scene then moves to the strip club, with the rapper wearing a black leather corset showing off some moves on the pole and dollars flying all around her. She also makes an appearance as part of the audience in the club, wearing a massive version of a slanted hat.\nThe looks in the old-world style room scene and in the bank vault were inspired by Thierry Mugler's 1999 Playboy photo shoot and Lil' Kim's look at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, respectively. As of June 2020, the age-restricted video has garnered more than 100 million views, while the audio has accumulated more than 200 million views.\nIn Rolling Stone, Charles Holmes opined that the video \"is a monument to celebration and opulent overload [...] The metaphors aren't subtle.

The song was written by Derulo, Stevie Hoang, David Paich and Jeff Porcaro, while production was handled by RedOne, BeatGeek and Geo Slam. Musically, \"Fight for You\" is an urban-pop ballad, that samples the song \"Africa\" (1982) by American rock band Toto. The lyrics revolve around how Derulo, the protagonist, has \"got a girl in his life he isn't ready to let go of just yet\". Hoang had originally recorded \"Fight for You\" for his third independent album, Unsigned (2011) with his original track featuring Iyaz.\nThe song's production and Derulo's vocal performance garnered positive reviews from music critics, however, some criticized its lack of originality. \"Fight for You\" attained moderate chart success, peaking at number five in Australia, and reaching the top twenty in the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video portrays a fictional relationship between Derulo and his love interest. Derulo performed the song at KDWB-FM's annual Jingle Ball in 2011.\n\"Fight for You\" was written by Jason Derulo, Stevie Hoang, David Paich and Jeff Porcaro, while production of the song was helmed by RedOne, BeatGeek and Geo Slam. \"Fight for You\" was originally recorded by Hoang, for his third independent album, Unsigned (2011). His version of the song features British Virgin Island recording artist Iyaz.\nDerulo's version of \"Fight for You\" was recorded and engineered by Gelly Kusuma, Slam and Teddy Sky at Serenity West Recording Studio and Jim Henson Studios in Los Angeles, California. Derulo, RedOne, Laila Khayat, Samya Khayat and Sky performed background vocals on the song. The recordings were later mixed by Trevor Muzzy. All instruments and programming were provided by RedOne, BeatGeek and Slam. In a cover story for the Daily Star, Derulo stated that \"Fight for You\" was the first song he worked on with RedOne, saying \"I'm glad it turned out so dope\". On working with RedOne, he said: \"Red first became hot when he produced the album The Fame with Lady Gaga. He is one of the nicest guys I've ever met.\u00a0...\u00a0RedOne was a nice, humble, down-to-earth, special person\".\n\"Fight for You\" was added to mainstream radio playlists in the United Kingdom on November 9, 2011. A digital extended play, featuring four remixes of the song, was released in Ireland and the UK on December 2, 2011.\n\"Fight for You\" is an urban-pop ballad with a length of four minutes and two seconds. According to Meena Rupani of DesiHits, the song finds Derulo as the male protagonist singing \"that he's got a girl in his life he isn't ready to let go of just yet\". The song contains a sample of the song \"Africa\" (1982) by American rock band Toto. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that \"Fight for You\" features \"airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats\". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of \"Fight for You\", saying: \"It's very relationship-based and the line [\"fight for you\"] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, I was in a relationship and I put myself in that place again where you would do anything to keep the relationship together so I went back to that place.\"\n\"Fight for You\" garnered positive reviews from music critics for its catchy production and Derulo's vocal performance. David Griffiths of 4Music called it a \"catchy little ditty\" that \"is guaranteed to be stuck in your head for the rest of the day\". Shawn Kitchener of Entertainment Wise described the song as \"the kind of sweet-as-candy R&B fodder\" that could have been featured on the High School Musical soundtrack. Meena Rupani of DesiHits noted that the song's lyrical theme is similar to \"It Girl\", and that Derulo's \"vocals are enough to put any girl into a trance\". However, \"Fight for You\" also received unfavorable reviews from critics because of its lack of originality. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song a three out of five star rating, calling Derulo \"extremely lazy\" for sampling \"Africa\". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian described the song as \"languid\", while writing that the sample gives it \"a bit of bounce\". Although Jess Holton of The Music Network described \"Fight for You\" as a \"touching ballad\", she added that sampling \"Africa\" does not do the latter \"any form of justice\"."

The song features a guest appearance from Young Jeezy, and includes background vocals from Mr Hudson and Tony Williams. It was produced by West, while co-produced by Jeff Bhasker. The producers wrote the song alongside Malik Yusef, Consequence, Jeff Bhasker, and Young Jeezy. The song was serviced to US rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio stations as the third single from the album on March 10, 2009, by Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam. A hip hop song with pop influences, it features piano. Lyrically, West sings an attempt to capture part of his former bravado.\n\"Amazing\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, most of whom complimented Young Jeezy's feature. Some praised the composition and structure, while numerous critics chose the song as an album highlight. At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Best Rap Performance By a Duo or Group. In 2009, the song charted at number 81 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 42 on the Swedish Singles Chart. It has since been certified platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nAn accompanying music video premiered via BET's 106 & Park on April 23, 2009. The video was shot in Kauai, Hawaii, with it prominently featuring aerial shots of the Hawaiian Islands. The visual was ranked by BET as among the top 100 videos of 2009. West provided performances of \"Amazing\" throughout 2009, including one for his second live album, VH1 Storytellers (2010). The song was used by the National Basketball Association (NBA) in a campaign for the 2009 playoffs, before it was later featured on the respective soundtracks of the video games NBA 2K10 and NBA 2K13.\nWest's 2007 hit single \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" was passed on to him by American rapper and his Def Jam labelmate Young Jeezy, who performs ad-libs on the song. Following the success of \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\", Young Jeezy felt that West \"owed him one\" because of the ad-libs being used and featured him on his single \"Put On\" (2008). The rapper recalled that West was initially reluctant to guest on the single due to his time on hiatus, before calling him back 10 minutes later and performing his verse. \"Put On\" was the first record that West performed through Auto-Tune on, while \"Amazing\" marked the second collaboration between him and Young Jeezy. The former was nominated for the Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group award at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in 2009, standing as the first collaboration between the two to be nominated for a Grammy Award. Young Jeezy said of fellow album track \"RoboCop\", which he co-wrote, in 2008: \"You know how you hear some songs and they just sound big? That's one of them. Right away, it just sounds like a big hit.\" In a 2019 interview for Complex, fellow rapper Consequence likened West's ninth studio album Jesus Is King from that year to 808s & Heartbreak creatively; he cited writing the chorus to \"Amazing\" as part of his challenging involvement.

The song features a guest appearance from English musician Mr Hudson and background vocals from Kid Cudi. West handled the production, with co-production from Bhasker and Plain Pat. The song was written by the producers alongside Consequence and Kid Cudi. It was serviced to top 40 radio stations in the United States on March 23, 2009, as the fourth and final single from the album. An upbeat new wave track, the song features electronic drum effects and pop synths. Its lyrical content is centered around West being pushed away by the mistrustful thinking of a woman that he is in love with.\nThe song received generally positive reviews from music critics, with the majority of them being complimentary towards the production, while some critics compared \"Paranoid\" to the works of other artists. It charted at numbers 14 and 90 on the Belgium Ultratip Wallonia chart and ARIA Singles Chart, respectively, in 2009. That same year, the song reached number 18 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, and has since been certified gold in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). West and Mr Hudson have performed the song live together on numerous occasions, including at the 2009 iTunes Festival. An accompanying music video, directed by Nabil Elderkin and starring Rihanna, was released on June 3, 2009. Based around a fantasy from her paranoid mindstate, the video sees her going through a dream sequence. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. A remix, featuring Mr Hudson and rapper Big Sean, was released in December 2008. Since its release, the song has been covered by both the Suzan and Kali Uchis.\nWest produced \"Paranoid\", while the song was co-produced by American record producers Jeff Bhasker and Plain Pat. The producers co-wrote it with Consequence and rapper Kid Cudi. Outside of his feature on the song, Mr Hudson helped write and produce fellow 808s & Heartbreak tracks \"Say You Will\" and \"Street Lights\". The musician received a phone call from West while on vacation in Paris; West was drawn in by his charm and subsequently recruited him for \"Paranoid\". After featuring Mr Hudson on the song, West signed him to his record label GOOD Music. The musician subsequently released his debut studio album Straight No Chaser under GOOD Music in October 2009, with West contributing vocals on the single \"Supernova\". West and Kid Cudi first met each other at a Virgin Megastore in 2004, with the meeting including Cudi requesting West to sign him; West respectfully declined the request, though the rapper told him, \"I have the potential for greatness.\" After Plain Pat sent West Kid Cudi's debut mixtape A Kid Named Cudi (2008), West arrived at the mixtape's listening party and took Cudi under his wing. He subsequently co-wrote several songs on the album in Hawaii with West, including \"Paranoid\" and \"Heartless\". Kid Cudi has been believed to have directly influenced the album's creation, which West himself confirmed as being true. 808s & Heartbreak track \"Welcome to Heartbreak\" stood as the first ever collaboration between the two, though they later collaborated on numerous other tracks, including Kid Cudi's \"Erase Me\" and West's \"Gorgeous\". They went on to form a duo under the name of Kids See Ghosts, releasing their eponymous debut studio album on June 8, 2018.\nThough the majority of the album sees West at his most vulnerable, \"Paranoid\" is one of its most joyful songs. The song was recorded during the period of three weeks that West worked on 808s & Heartbreak in 2008. Seeking out a minimalist direction sonically, West directed his team to bring unique drum machines to Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii. They were sampled and reprogrammed into West's Roland TR-808 drum machine at the studio, which recording engineer Anthony Kilhoffer explained was responsible for the song's \"unique sounds\". West had been looking for an electronic sound with the album, which the song includes.\nMusically, \"Paranoid\" is an upbeat new wave song that runs for a duration of four minutes and thirty-seven seconds, and includes an electronic sound throughout. Its instrumentation has synth-pop elements, nodding towards"

Taken from her sixth studio album Two Eleven (2012), it was written and produced by Sean Garrett, Shondrae \"Bangladesh\" Crawford and Dwayne \"Dem Jointz\" Abernathy along with Brown, telling the story of Norwood complimenting a prospective beau on his swag. The bass-heavy, R&B up-tempo track served as Norwood's first release under RCA Records, since signing to Chameleon Records under the label, and was released to US digital outlets on May 4, 2012.\nUpon release, \"Put It Down\" was met by a warm response from critics, who criticized Brown's involvement on the song but generally praised the progressive production and suggestive lyrics. It reached the top forty of the Belgian Ultratop 50 chart as well as the South Korean Gaon Chart and the top-five of the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, marking Norwood's tenth top ten entry and first since \u201cWhat About Us?\u201d in 2002.\nThe accompanying music video features interactions with Brown, as well as scenes including Norwood dancing in front of both blue-lit industrial backdrops and artful Jackson Pollock-esque green screens. Filmed in Los Angeles, California and directed by Hype Williams, the clip was creatively moulded by Frank Gatson Jr., and choreographed by Jaquel Knight. The video received general acclaim from critics, who commended the simplicity of the video, while many labeled it as her most fun visual in years. Norwood also teamed up with rappers 2 Chainz and Tyga to remix the single, while rapper Eve released a self-crafted remix on her EVEstylin\u2019 Tuesdays series in November 2012.\n\"Put It Down\" was revealed as the name of the album's official leading single in Norwood's interview for True Exclusives. Norwood confirmed the release of the song, following her February 2012 joint single \"It All Belongs to Me\" with fellow R&B singer Monica, on April 12, and also revealed Brown as a co-writer and vocal feature on the song. On her decision to release it as a single, she commented, \"I love taking risks in music and it's great to challenge yourself to be different. That's what I love about the song.\" In a Billboard interview, Norwood further commented about the track, saying that she \"felt like, [when] being gone for such a long time, you need to come back with something strong and shock people. Make them go, 'Wow, who is that? Oh my God, that's Brandy? I didn't' even know she can sound like that. Didn't know she would do a song like that?' Because It's completely different than anything I've ever done.\"\nMusically, the singer described the song as \u201cvery commercial, but at the same time, it's got a dope hip-hop influence\u2014it's club, it's radio, it's all formats.\" In August 2012, Norwood sat for an interview with Nadeska Alexis of MTV News, where she elaborated on how the song was conceptualized. \"Chris Brown also wrote a song on the album called \"Slower\", so naturally he's heard other songs that I've done and he kinda just hopped on \"Put It Down\" \u2014 rapping and singing \u2014 and it was organic and very authentic.\" In this way, Brown ended up co-writing the track for Two Eleven. She further explained, that \"when I heard it, I thought, 'This is great,' [because] he brought a whole new flavor to the record. Sean [Garrett] already made it kinda swagged out, but Chris is just the icing on the cake, and I appreciated him for being a part of it and just being so supportive as an artist. He's so great, the girls love him, and I thought it would be great to have him on board.\"\n\"Put It Down\" was written by Shondrae \"Bangladesh\" Crawford, Isaiah Watkins, Dwayne \"Dem Jointz\" Abernathy, and fellow R&B recording artists Sean Garrett, and Chris Brown, while production was handled by Bangladesh and Garrett themselves, featuring co-production by Dem Jointz. The song is a bass-heavy, contemporary R&B up-tempo song featuring tinny percussion and canned claps. It begins with an electronically manipulated voice constantly repeating the song's chorus: \"I\u2019mma put it down / you gon' fall in love\".\nLyrically, it features Norwood complementing a prospective beau on his swag. \"You're talking so tough, damn, I love it all, even the way you flex, that's what turns me on,\" she sings. Later, according to Idolator blog, Brown adopts a Nicki Minaj-like vocal delivery and raps, \"Sippin\u2019 on that Brandy, that liquor comes in handy, girl, I know you fancy, but this party I'm financing.\" In the"

It features uncredited vocals by Norwegian singer and songwriter Ina Wroldsen.\nThe single received generally positive reviews, and was commercially successful, reaching the top-ten in 22 countries, including number two on the UK Singles Chart and number one in Australia, Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands and Russia.\nOn 3 June 2015, Harris announced an upcoming collaboration with London-based production trio Disciples. The song leaked on 15 July 2015, two days prior to its official release.\nThe song first materialised when London-based band Disciples and Norwegian singer-songwriter Ina Wroldsen co-wrote it in early 2014. They recorded the vocals of Wroldsen in one take for the demo. Two of the artists from Disciples who are published by Fly-Eye (Harris's publishing company) decided to send him the rough demonstration for feedback and pointers. Harris loved the track and eventually proposed collaborating on it together.\nHarris told radio KISS-FM that following the release of Motion, he wanted to do something else, something a bit different. He wanted a single out for the summer because it had been so long since it had happened. \"I missed the feeling of having a new song out in the summer.\"\n\"How Deep Is Your Love\" is a deep house song. Your EDM described it as an \"upbeat tune\", containing \"bass-y plucks and piano chords\". For Hayden Manders of Nylon, the track is influenced by 90s Euro house and compared it to Disclosure's music.\nBillboard called the song \"another dance club anthem from the reliable hitmaker.\" Hayden Manders of Nylon felt Harris returned to form thanks to \"How Deep Is Your Love\". Writing for Jezebel Jia Tolentino described it as a \"a straightforward, minimalist full-on heater with a contagious playfulness in its three main hooks\" and credited Disciples for \"the subtlety in this track\". Daniel Cha from Your EDM opined that the song is \"an ideal soundtrack to an oceanside drive\".\nLewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote \"Calvin Harris is ready to soundtrack the rest of your summer with his new deep house banger.\" Time's Nolan Feeney wrote: \"'How Deep Is Your Love' doesn\u2019t evoke the pummeling build-ups and synthesizer onslaughts of Rihanna's 'We Found Love' or Cheryl Cole's 'Call My Name'. Instead, [Harris] opts for some slow-burning house. If his next album sounds this fresh, the love will go pretty deep, actually.\"\n\"How Deep Is Your Love\" entered at number seven on the UK Singles Chart, giving Harris his 19th top ten hit on the chart. The song eventually peaked at number two. The song debuted at number five on the US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs. It sold 41,000 downloads and captured two million U.S. streams (the bulk of which, 74 percent, came from Spotify) in its first week. It marked Harris' eighth top ten since the chart's launch, making it the most of any act (previously, he was tied with Zedd at seven each).\nAdditionally, the song debuted at number four on Dance/Electronic Digital Songs and at number six on the Dance/Electronic Streaming Songs. On its tenth week, it has hit number three on both the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs and the Dance/Electronic Streaming Songs and reahced number two on the Dance/Electronic Digital Songs and the Dance Club Songs. The song also debuted on Dance/Mix Show Airplay at number 24. It eventually reached number one on the chart after 10 weeks, giving Harris his ninth number one on this chart. Since the chart began in 2003, only Rihanna has racked up more number ones (11 hits). The single also debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 60. and has since peaked at number 27.\nIn the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, the song debuted at number eight and in its sixth week on the chart, reached number one. It is Harris' first number-one single there.\nThe accompanying music video for \"How Deep Is Your Love\", directed by Emil Nava, premiered on Tidal on 4 August 2015 and was released elsewhere on 6 August 2015. It features American model Gigi Hadid. Filming took place in Malibu, California in late June 2015.\nThe video begins with Gigi laying on a table which she gets up on and walks down a hall into a party with bikinied women. Other scenes include Gigi flashing in different colors in a black background. Gigi then finds"

Written and produced by Jackson and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the ballad was released as the album's third single on October 12, 1993, by Virgin Records, and talks about the reconnection with an old lover. Originally an experimental sound Jam and Lewis was considering for the album, they did not give the song serious contemplation until the film producers from Poetic Justice requested a ballad for the soundtrack.\nCritics were divided on their opinions of \"Again\". Some praised it as a highlight from the Janet album and a classic, while other critics responded negatively to its sentimental lyrical content. However, \"Again\" became a commercial success, topping the US Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in late 1993, while also reaching the top-ten in Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and reaching the Top 20 elsewhere.\n\"Again\" received Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song. Two videos for the song, directed by Jackson's then-husband Ren\u00e9 Elizondo, Jr., were released: one with and other without scenes from Poetic Justice. The song was covered by How to Dress Well for his second album Total Loss and sampled by Iyaz on his single \"Solo\".\nIn 1992, Janet Jackson filmed her first film, Poetic Justice, prior to recording a new album. In \"Poetic Justice\", Justice (Jackson) uses her poetry to deal with her grief after her boyfriend is killed in a shooting incident at a drive-in. After shooting the film, Jackson started recording a new album, declaring that the film inspired her to take new direction in her music, \"Rhythm Nation was a heavy record, and Poetic Justice was a heavy movie. I wanted to do something lighter but also daring ... When I wrote the album, I was still in a poetic frame of mind, inspired by Maya's beautiful language.\"\n\"Again\" was originally an experimental sound the production duo Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis was considering for the album. While Jackson found its melody compelling, the trio did not give the song serious contemplation until the film producers from Poetic Justice requested a ballad for the film's soundtrack. Jackson subsequently wrote the lyrics for \"Again\" and shaped them around Jam's melody. The song was eventually included as the closing song to the film, but was not included on its soundtrack album. It was later released as janet.'s third single on October 12, 1993, with the jazz-funky track \"Funky Big Band\" from the album appearing on the single as a B-side, as well as a French version of the song, which also appeared on the limited edition of the janet. album.\n\"Again\" was written and produced by Janet Jackson, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. It is set in common time with a key of C major. Jackson's vocal chords ranges between the tonal nodes of low-tone G\u2083 to high-tone D\u2085. The song is in a moderate tempo of 64 beats per minute with the chord progression being set like C\u2013G\u2013Am\u2013F\u2013C\u2013Dm7/G in the first verse and C\u2013E\u2013Am7\u2013D9 in the chorus. \"Again\" is a \"lightweight\" piano ballad, based on a lost love. The song's story is about running into an old friend, only to discover that the feelings for that person are as strong as ever. \"Kinda late in the game and my heart is in your hands. Don't you stand there and then tell me you love me and leave me again,\" she sings.\n\"Again\" divided music critics. Despite calling it a \"throwaway\", Alex Henderson of AllMusic picked the song as a highlight from the album. Larry Flick from Billboard called it \"a delicate ballad\". He added, \"Her evocative voice is swathed in grand piano lines and quasi-orchestral strings that will thrill ardent fans at top 40 radio. Melancholy lyrics are icing on a sweet musical cake that millions will want to taste.\" In a \"classic track-by-track review\", another editor, Andrew Hampp remarked, \"By the time Jackson pleas at the song's close, seemingly choking back tears, \"Cause I've fallen in love with you again,\" it's hard not to get misty even after countless listens.\" Essence ranked \"Again\" as the number-four Greatest Break-up song of all-time. John Martinucci from the Gavin Report described it as \"a tender love song that definitely tugs on the heart strings.\" Music writer James Masterton viewed it as \"a slushy ballad\" in his weekly UK chart commentary.

Hutton. \"The Way That I Love You\" is a song recorded by American singer Ashanti from her fourth studio album, The Declaration (2008). It was released as the album's lead single on February 26, 2008, through Universal and The Inc. Ashanti wrote and produced the song with L.T. Hutton. Backed by piano, guitar, and horns, \"The Way That I Love You\" is a midtempo R&B ballad whose lyrics tell of betrayal. \nCritical response was primarily positive; some reviewers said it was a highlight from The Declaration while others felt it was inferior to music released by Beyonc\u00e9 and Mary J. Blige. Commercially, the song peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and appeared on the publication's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Adult R&B Songs component charts. Ashanti performed \"The Way That I Love You\" at Sessions@AOL and on tour.\nKevin Bray directed the music video which tells the story of Ashanti and her boyfriend\u2014he cheats on her, she discovers it, and she murders him. The story for the video was inspired by the true crime TV shows Snapped and Forensic Files. The video's emphasis on violence attracted critical attention. As part of the song's promotion, Ashanti launched a website that allowed users to create and send a personalized news report and death threat to a contact. The campaign was received negatively and incited a protest in Los Angeles. The website was ultimately taken down.\nFor her fourth studio album The Declaration (2008), Ashanti collaborated with songwriters and producers outside of her record label Murder Inc. Her previous album Concrete Rose (2004) had been overshadowed by negative news regarding the label, including a feud with G-Unit and an FBI investigation. L.T. Hutton produced a majority of The Declaration, instead of Ashanti's longtime producer Irv Gotti. Ashanti said that she had more artistic freedom with the album. Hutton and Ashanti wrote and produced \"The Way That I Love\". Ashanti said that she \"just started jotting down words, and it just kind of poured out\" upon hearing the opening instrumental. She produced the lead and background vocals, and Hutton programmed the song and played the instruments. The final version was mixed at Brandons Way Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. \n\"Switch\", which featured Nelly, and \"Hey Baby (After the Club)\" were both announced as the album's lead single in 2007. They were replaced by \"The Way That I Love You\",  which was released to urban radio on February 26, 2008, and rhythmic radio on April 1, 2008. It was the number one most-added song on urban radio in the week of its release. The single was included on a July 2008 Cartier charity playlist created to support the Boys & Girls Clubs of America organization.\n\"The Way That I Love You\" is a midtempo R&B ballad that lasts four minutes and thirty seconds. It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a \"moderate hip-hop\" tempo. The instrumentation is provided by a piano, a guitar, and horns; Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the single is \"driven by a distinct descending piano arpeggio and horn arrangement\". \nAshanti's vocal range spans from the low note of D\u2084 to the high note of E\u2085. AllMusic's Andy Kellman compared her vocals to her 2003 single \"Rain on Me\" because of their similar \"melodramatic flourishes\" but said the lyrics of \"The Way That I Love You\" were \"much more vengeful in nature than depressive.\" Ashanti felt both men and women would relate to the single's theme of betrayal.\n\"The Way That I Love You\" was praised by critics who identified it as a highlight of The Declaration. The New York Daily News' Jim Farber felt Ashanti's collaboration with Hutton was her best work, and described \"The Way That I Love You\" as a \"strut of a song.\" Noah Berlatsky of the Chicago Reader noted the song's piano loop as one of the few standouts from the album. A Dayton Daily News reviewer summed up the single as \"cliche but effective.\" \nOn the other hand, some commentators negatively compared \"The Way That I Love You\" to music released by other singers. Despite praising Ashanti's performance as emotional, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly found the single to be inferior to those by Beyonc\u00e9 and Mary J. Blige. Vibe's Shanel Odum dismissed the song as \"barely set[ting] off a smoke detector, let alone ring[ing] any alarms\", in a reference to Beyonc\u00e9's 2006 single \"Ring the Alarm\".\nCommercially, \"The Way That I Love You\" peaked at"

The song was inspired by a newspaper article Vedder read about Jeremy Wade Delle, a high school student who shot himself in front of his English class on January 8, 1991. It reached the number five spot on both the Mainstream and Modern Rock Billboard charts. It did not originally chart on the regular Billboard Hot 100 singles chart since it was not released as a commercial single in the US at the time, but a re-release in July 1995 brought it up to number 79.\nThe song gained popularity for its music video, directed by Mark Pellington and released in 1992, which received heavy rotation by MTV and became a hit. The original music video for \"Jeremy\" was directed and produced by Chris Cuffaro. Epic Records and MTV later rejected the music video, and released the version directed by Pellington instead.  In 1993, the \"Jeremy\" video was awarded four MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Video of the Year.\n\"Jeremy\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by bassist Jeff Ament. The song's music was written before the band went out on tour in support of Alice in Chains in February 1991.\nAment on the song:\nI already had two pieces of music that I wrote on acoustic guitar...with the idea that I would play them on a Hamer 12-string bass I had just ordered. When the bass arrived, one of [the pieces] became \"Jeremy\"...I had an idea for the outro when we were recording it the second time...I overdubbed a twelve-string bass, and we added a cello. That was big-time production, for us....Rick [Parashar]\u2019s a supertalented engineer-musician...Stone [Gossard, Pearl Jam\u2019s rhythm guitarist] was sick one day, and Ed, Rick and I conjured up the art piece that opens and closes the song. That was so fun\u2014I wanted to make a whole record like that.\nIn another interview, Ament stated:\nWe knew it was a good song, but it was tough getting it to feel right\u2014for the chorus to sit back and the outro to push over the top. The tune went from practically not making it on the record to being one of the best takes. I'm not sure if it's the best song on the album but I think it's the best take. On \"Jeremy\" I always heard this other melody in the choruses and the end, and it never sounded good on guitar or bass. So we brought in a cello player which inspired a background vocal, and those things made the song really happen. Most of the time if something doesn't work right away, I just say fuck it\u2014but this was an instance when perseverance paid off.\n\"Jeremy\" is based on two different true stories. The song takes its main inspiration from a newspaper article about a 15-year-old boy named Jeremy Wade Delle from Richardson, Texas, who shot himself in front of his teacher and his second period English class of 30 students on the morning of January 8, 1991. In a 2009 interview, Vedder said that he felt \"the need to take that small article and make something of it\u2014to give that action, to give it reaction, to give it more importance.\"\nDelle was described by schoolmates as \"real quiet\" and known for \"acting sad\". After coming into class late that morning, Delle was told to get an admittance slip from the school office. He left the classroom, and returned with a .357 Magnum revolver. Delle walked to the front of the classroom, announced \"Miss, I got what I really went for\", put the barrel of the firearm in his mouth, and pulled the trigger before his teacher or classmates could react. Lisa Moore, a schoolmate, knew Jeremy from the in-school suspension program: \"He and I would pass notes back and forth and he would talk about life and stuff,\" she said. \"He signed all of his notes, 'Write back.' But on Monday he wrote, 'Later days.' I didn't know what to make of it. But I never thought this would happen.\"\nWhen asked about the song, Vedder explained:\nIt came from a small paragraph in a paper which means you kill yourself and you make a big old sacrifice and try to get your revenge. That all you're gonna end up with is a paragraph in a newspaper. Sixty-four degrees and cloudy in a suburban neighborhood. That's the beginning of the video and that's the same thing in the end; it does nothing \u2026 nothing changes. The world goes on and you're gone. The best revenge"

Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music co-written by drummer Matt Cameron and guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard, \"The Fixer\" was released on August 24, 2009 as the first single from the band's ninth studio album, Backspacer (2009). The song debuted and peaked at number two on the Billboard Rock Songs chart and reached number three on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.\n\"The Fixer\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music co-written by drummer Matt Cameron and guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard. Cameron wrote the majority of the song's music in 2008, while Gossard and McCready would end up writing the song's bridge. In an interview with Rolling Stone in February 2009, Vedder discussed a song matching the description of \"The Fixer\". Vedder stated, \"That could have been a seven-minute, weird, sideways kind of artsy song with a cool groove...I tinkered with it after everyone left, and we shrunk it down and turned it into something else....I'm thinking about set lists: 'Will this be a song we'll play every night?'.\"\nGossard on the song:\nWith that song, Matt came in with a riff and we worked out a few different arrangements. Then Ed took it and re-arranged it with Pro Tools, to get the parts he needed in the right place. You don't want to get a final arrangement for a song before he's had a chance to screw around with it, because once he gets it, it can all change. What you thought was a chorus can end up being a verse. There was a real collaborative effort on the whole album. Ed, in particular, worked with everyone on their songs.\n\"The Fixer\" is composed in the key of D major, and uses odd time signatures and switches between them regularly throughout the song. The song starts in 5/4, then switches to 6/4 for the verse, while the chorus and bridge are both in 4/4. Gossard stated, \"It's relatively straightforward, but it has Matt's love of odd time. It also breaks back down to something very three-chord and fun. We need that. If Pearl Jam is thinking too much, we're not very good. We're much better when we're not thinking.\"\nGossard on the song:\nI think the band definitely progressed and did some things we haven't done before. When people talk about \"pop\" I think it's about a simplicity of melody and a simplicity of arrangement that doesn't over complicate a good idea or a great lyric. I think \"The Fixer\" is a great example. You really hear something about Eddie's personality in the lyric and you get a view that a lot of people don't get from him which is a sort of optimistic and playful melody and lyric.\nCommenting on the suggestion that he is \"The Fixer\" referred to in the song's title, Vedder stated, \"My answer is, aren't we all? Maybe I'm wrong to think that, but it seems like we are...I'm thinking more on a worldview or a community view.\"\nVedder on the song:\nMen, we all think we can fix anything. It's not necessarily a good thing. In a relationship, a woman will say 'This is wrong,' and we're like, 'I'll fix that, don't worry about it, we can fix it.' These wonderful people, the woman you're in a relationship with, they don't want you to fix it. They just want you to listen to what's happening: 'Don't fix it, I want you to own this with me\u2014feel it.' This is a reminder song to me, to stop fixing.\nOn July 14, 2009, a 30-second clip of \"The Fixer\" was featured on Fox's broadcast of the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. \"The Fixer\" was released to radio airplay on July 20, 2009. A 7\" single for \"The Fixer\" was released commercially through the band's official website on August 24, 2009, accompanied by the B-side \"Supersonic\", also from the album. The song was also made available commercially as a single download minus the B-side \"Supersonic\" from iTunes on the same day. The same track listing that is featured on the 7\" single is also featured on a UK CD single release and a digital download from the UK Amazon.com store, both of which were released commercially on September 7, 2009.\nThe song debuted and peaked at number 56 on the Billboard Hot 100, number ten on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and reached number three on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. In Canada, the song reached the top 20 on the Canadian Hot 100. \"The Fixer\" reached the top 100 in"

The song is the highest-charting single by the band in their home country, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart. Additionally, it reached number three in Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-ten hit in several other European countries and New Zealand. The music video won the British Video of the Year at the 1990 Brit Awards.\nThe meaning of \"Lullaby\" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for addiction, depression, or sexual assault, and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse. One explanation by Smith follows that the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending they would always have. Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music videos, interprets \"Lullaby\" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.\nRayna Khaitan from Albumism wrote, \"The thrillingly creepy \"Lullaby\" recalls a familiar sense of claustrophobia prevalent in The Cure's canon, only this time more than others, Smith seems a little intoxicated with the idea of surrender.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described the song as \"eerie\" and \"string-laced\". Another editor, Ned Raggett stated that \"Smith's detailing of the spiderman coming along to envelope and devour is classically Cure, while the tight, haunted-house vibe of the song is another winner.\" Music & Media commented, \"Those of you who feared the worst for The Cure's artistic future after 1986's Why Can't I Be You? and Hot Hot Hot, can stop worrying. Their new single is serious pop music at its best. The backing is a strong, infectious rhythm with subtle plucked violins and sweeping strings, completed by Robert Smith's whispering voice. Although this is not the easiest record to programme it has already become many European DJs' favourite.\" In their review of Disintegration, People Magazine noted that the group \"perks up sporadically\" on songs like \"Lullaby\".\nUpon its release, \"Lullaby\" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It remains their only single to reach the top five in the United Kingdom. In Ireland, \"Lullaby\" became the band's third top 10 hit and highest-charting single, reaching number three. The song also reached the top 10 in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Norway. In North America, the song was released as the second single from Disintegration instead (\"Fascination Street\" was the first), but did not match its predecessor's level of success, only reaching number 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 23 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart.\nThe music video for \"Lullaby\" was filmed at a sound stage in London, England. It features Robert in bed, in a dream sequence, and the rest of the band playing tin soldiers who sporadically appear throughout the music video for a few seconds. The music video, during which Smith plays both the cannibalistic \"spiderman\" mentioned in the lyrics and his intended victim, concludes with Smith being swallowed by what appears to be a giant spider.\nThe music video, directed by Tim Pope and edited by Peter Goddard, won British Video of the Year at the 1990 Brit Awards.\nThe US-only single \"Fascination Street\" included the B-sides from the UK release of \"Lullaby\". Therefore, the US release needed some new B-sides. The two live cuts, \"Homesick\" and \"Untitled\", are from the limited edition live album Entreat, which was recorded during the Disintegration Tour.\nThe song was remixed for single release, giving it more of an electronic feel.\n7-inch: Fiction / FISC 29 (UK)\n\"Lullaby\" (remix) \u2013 4:08\n\"Babble\" \u2013 4:16\n7-inch: Elektra / 7-69249 (US)\n\"Lullaby\" (remix)\n\"Homesick\" (live version)\nalso released on cassette (9 46924-9)\n12-inch: Fiction / ficx 29 (UK)\n\"Lullaby\" (extended remix)\n\"Babble\"\n\"Out of Mind\"\n12-inch: Elektra / 0 66664 (US)\n\"Lullaby\" (extended remix)\n\"Homesick\" (live version)\n\"Untitled\" (live version)\nCD: Fiction / ficcd 29 (UK)\n\"Lullaby\" (remix)\n\"Babble\"\n\"Out of Mind\"\n\"Lullaby\" (extended remix)\ngatefold 3\" CD\nCD: Elektra / 9 66664-2 (US)\n\"Lullaby\" (remix)\n\"Lullaby\" (extended remix)\n\"Homesick\" (live version)\n\"Untitled\" (live version)\nRobert Smith \u2013 vocals, six-string bass, keyboards\nSimon Gallup \u2013 bass guitar\nPorl Thompson \u2013 guitar\nBoris Williams \u2013 drums, percussion\nRoger"

The song debuted and peaked at number two on the Billboard Rock Songs chart and reached number three on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.\n\"The Fixer\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music co-written by drummer Matt Cameron and guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard. Cameron wrote the majority of the song's music in 2008, while Gossard and McCready would end up writing the song's bridge. In an interview with Rolling Stone in February 2009, Vedder discussed a song matching the description of \"The Fixer\". Vedder stated, \"That could have been a seven-minute, weird, sideways kind of artsy song with a cool groove...I tinkered with it after everyone left, and we shrunk it down and turned it into something else....I'm thinking about set lists: 'Will this be a song we'll play every night?'.\"\nGossard on the song:\nWith that song, Matt came in with a riff and we worked out a few different arrangements. Then Ed took it and re-arranged it with Pro Tools, to get the parts he needed in the right place. You don't want to get a final arrangement for a song before he's had a chance to screw around with it, because once he gets it, it can all change. What you thought was a chorus can end up being a verse. There was a real collaborative effort on the whole album. Ed, in particular, worked with everyone on their songs.\n\"The Fixer\" is composed in the key of D major, and uses odd time signatures and switches between them regularly throughout the song.

Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard, \"Even Flow\" was released in 1992 as the second single from the band's debut album, Ten (1991). The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003). A remixed version of the song was included on the 2009 Ten reissue.\n\"Even Flow\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, \"I knew it was a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it.\" Drummer Dave Krusen said, \"I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation.\" He added that \"it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better.\" Guitarist Mike McCready stated, \"We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare. We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out.\"\nAn alternate version of the song was recorded with drummer Dave Abbruzzese in 1992 while the band was recording songs for the soundtrack for the 1992 film, Singles. This version was used for the music video, and was used in single releases in the United Kingdom. This version can also be found on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003).\n\"Even Flow\" was written in the key of D major, with Gossard performing his parts in open D tuning and McCready complementing it with a similar rhythm pattern in standard tuning. The recorded version of the song actually sounds slightly sharper than D major, with everything tuned up \u2014 accidentally or otherwise \u2014 around one quarter of a step. The song features a funk guitar riff by Gossard.\nMcCready on the song:\nThat's me pretending to be Stevie Ray Vaughan, and a feeble attempt at that. Stone (Gossard, Pearl Jam guitarist) wrote the riff and song; I think it's a D tuning. I just followed him in a regular pattern. I tried to steal everything I know from Stevie Ray Vaughan and put it into that song. A blatant rip-off. A tribute rip-off, if you will!\nThe vocal line that appears in the main verse begins with a very prominent tritone interval.\nThe stark lyrics by Vedder for \"Even Flow\" describe the experience of being a homeless man. The subject sleeps \"on a pillow made of concrete\" and panhandles passersby for spare change. In addition to being illiterate, he may also be mentally ill, as he \"looks insane\" when he smiles and struggles to keep coherent thoughts (\"Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies/Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away\").\nAt Pearl Jam's March 28, 1994, concert at the Bayfront Amphitheater in Miami, Vedder introduced the song by saying, \"I thought I'd throw in a bit of street education while you still have an open mind....Right across the street there's a little homeless community that lives under the bridge. You should just know that those people ain't all crazy and sometimes it's not their fault. This song is called 'Even Flow'.\"\nAt the May 12, 2008, show in Toronto, Vedder stated that the song was written under the Space Needle in Seattle. At a subsequent show in Seattle on August 8, 2018, Vedder revealed that the song was inspired by a homeless Vietnam War veteran (also named Eddie) whom he befriended while working on the band's first album. Vedder wrote the song after learning that the man had died while the band was touring.\nWhile the \"Even Flow\" single was released commercially to international markets in 1992, the commercial single was not released in the United States until June 27, 1995, and was only available as a more expensive import version beforehand. The alternate studio recording of \"Even Flow\", which was recorded in 1992 with Abbruzzese, was released as a CD single and 12-inch white vinyl in the United Kingdom. The original version was used in single releases in the United States. The song was released as a single in 1992 with a previously unreleased funk B-side titled \"Dirty Frank\", which can also be found as an extra track on European releases of"

It was released as the lead single from the band's fourth studio album The Great Escape on 14 August 1995. Released on the same day as the Oasis single \"Roll with It\" \u2013 in a chart battle dubbed the \"Battle of Britpop\" \u2013 \"Country House\" reached number one in the UK Singles Chart (the first of two Blur singles to reach number one, the second being 1997's \"Beetlebum\"). The song is the band's best-selling single, with over 540,000 copies sold as of May 2014.\nIn an interview for the South Bank Show, Damon Albarn explained that it was inspired by former Blur manager Dave Balfe, who left Blur's label Food Records and bought a house in the country.\nDavid Balfe moved to The Bury in 1994 at Church End in southern Bedfordshire off the A6. The house had 4 acres of land, nine bedrooms with five ensuite. He moved with his wife Helen and their children aged 2 and 4, when he was 36.\nThe house was advertised in 2015 for \u00a32m. It was Grade 2 listed in February 1975.\nThe song is about a man who retires to an expensive country house to escape the pressures of the city. The cover art features a horizontally-flipped image of Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria.\n\"Country House\" received a great deal of media attention when Blur's label Food Records moved the original release date to the same day as Oasis's \"Roll with It\". The British media had already reported an intense rivalry between the two bands and this clash of releases was seen as a battle for the number one spot, dubbed the \"Battle of Britpop\". In the end, \"Country House\" won the \"battle\", attaining the No. 1 spot while \"Roll with It\" came in at No. 2.\nThe music video for \"Country House\" was directed by artist Damien Hirst, who had attended Goldsmiths, University of London, with members of Blur. It features the band and a businessman (played by Keith Allen) in a flat with the band playing a board game called \"Escape from the Rat Race\" before they become trapped in the game where they are with farm animals and other people before appearing in the flat again. The band appears in the video alongside British comic actor Matt Lucas and models Sara Stockbridge and Jo Guest. It features pastiches of\u2014or tributes to\u2014Benny Hill (Lucas' doctor chasing scantily clad young women culminating in the entry of the milk van of Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)) and Queen's 1975 video for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". It was nominated for Best Video in the 1996 BRIT Awards.\nOn 20 August 1995 the charts were officially announced. (The Chart Show announced the winner the day before, though the show's chart was unofficial) \"Country House\" topped the UK Singles Chart, selling 270,000 copies, compared to 220,000 sold by \"Roll with It\", which came in at number two. Albarn himself was surprised that \"Country House\" topped the charts. He told NME, \"I sort of believed all the papers, including NME, who told me Oasis were going to win.\"\nAll music composed by Albarn, Coxon, James and Rowntree.

The single was released on 19 February 2001 on Superior Quality Recordings and reached number 39 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's first Top 40 single. The song would be included as the closing track on the band's debut album, Vibrate You and frequently closed their live shows.\n\nSuffocate was written on a bunk bed in Sawmills Studios in Cornwall by Matt Browne and Martyn Nelson during recording sessions for their debut album Vibrate You in late 2000. Nelson revealed it was \"a special moment\" when Browne played the chords and Nelson came up with the song's opening riff. They quickly agreed that Suffocate would be \"a good song\". Suffocate was produced and mixed by John Cornfield. Like other songs recorded for Vibrate You, Suffocate contains programmed drum loops which made up a backing track for the recording and live performances.\nBrowne called Suffocate \"an anti-love song, destruction of something beautiful\". He was inspired to write the song's lyrics after returning from a tour to find his then-girlfriend had died. Browne never had the chance to say he was sorry before her passing and the song became a way of conveying his emotions. On the band's 2012 Who Do You Love? | The King Adora Story documentary he revealed that \"things weren't well at all, most of it my fault, because I was too much caught up in the lifestyle of being on the road and ignoring what's real\".\nThree b-sides were released on the single, Aceface, Into Space and Drink Don't Think. All three songs were recorded at Woodbine Street Recording Studios in Royal Leamington Spa and were produced by the band and Dan Sprigg, with Sprigg and Jamie Travers mixing. Into Space featured the only use of trumpets on a King Adora song. Aceface would occasionally appear in the band's live sets during 2001 and was included as a bonus track on the Enhanced CD version of Vibrate You.\nThe Suffocate release was accompanied by King Adora's third music video, directed by Dan Crouch. Crouch commented that in the video \"the band is taken over by an apparition that travels into the room through the chandelier\".\nIn a poor review, NME said \"it's only marginally sexier, in fact, than Darius off Popstars doing Britney\". Drowned in Sound were positive, rating the single 8/10 and commenting \"if they can produce more of this, they may not be as throwaway as they first appeared\".\n\n\"Suffocate\"\n\"Aceface\"\n\"Smoulder\" (video)\n\"Suffocate\"\n\"Into Space\"\n\"Drink Don't Think\"\n\"Suffocate\" (video)\n\"Smoulder\"\n\"Aceface\"\nMatt Browne \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar\nMartyn Nelson \u2013 lead guitar\nRobbie Grimmit \u2013 bass\nDan Dabrowski \u2013 drums\nSuffocate \u2013 Produced and mixed by John Cornfield\nAceface, Into Space, Drink Don't Think \u2013 Produced by King Adora and Dan Sprigg, mixed by Dan Sprigg and Jamie Travers\n\"Chart Log UK: Alex K \u2013 Kyuss\".

The song was released internationally the following year as the album's fifth and final single. Garbage collaborated with English trip hop musician Tricky on a new version of \"Milk\" for single release. Much media comment was made regarding a rumoured fall-out over the sessions, when it became known that Garbage produced a further mix of \"Milk\" that only incorporated Tricky's vocals from that session.\nAfter an acclaimed live performance of the new recording of \"Milk\" at the 1996 MTV Europe Music Awards, as well as winning the Best Breakthrough Act, \"Milk (The Wicked Mix feat. Tricky)\" debuted at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, outselling the previous single \"Stupid Girl\". A mix that deleted Tricky's vocal, \"Milk (The Siren mix)\", charted in Germany, Australia and New Zealand.\nIn North America, \"Milk\" was released alongside album cut \"Supervixen\" as part of a dual-single strategy to build upon the momentum built from the success of previous single \"Stupid Girl\". The single release was supported by Garbage's support slot for the Smashing Pumpkins Infinite Sadness arena tour and pre-empted the release of a home video compilation of all the band's music videos. Both \"Milk\" and \"Supervixen\" failed to chart when alternative radio chose to heavily support their soundtrack feature \"#1 Crush\" instead.\n\"Milk\" was written and recorded by the band at their own recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin during the 1994\u201395 sessions for Garbage, and was the first track that Shirley Manson wrote from scratch. Guitarist Duke Erikson had happened to walk past Manson as she strummed an acoustic guitar in their studio lounge. He thought the melody she was humming was interesting and took the idea to the rest of the band: Steve Marker and drummer Butch Vig. Within an hour, they had set up a mic in the control room, Vig programmed some drum loops, Marker played bass and Erikson fired up the mellotron. Shirley's vocal (aside from overdubs) was recorded in a single take facing the control room speakers. The main body of the song was recorded in 45 minutes. At a later point, Garbage recorded some ambient textures for the track, and even had a clarinet part recorded, but these were ultimately removed in favour of keeping the production simple. \"It just had a really beautiful kind of feeling to it\", explained Manson, \"We tried to recreate it in the booth, but it just sounded flat.\" Vig elaborated: \"When it came to mix, we just left it the way we had [originally] recorded it\".\nManson had told the rest of the band [when she joined Garbage] that she was a songwriter, but the truth was that she had little input in the songwriting team that formed the core of her previous band: \"As the lead singer, I was left most of the time with coming up with the melody and the licks,\" Manson remembered, \"\"Milk\" was obviously augmented by the rest of Garbage, but the melody and the words are mine\". She was inspired by a line in Michael Ondaatje's The Collected Works of Billy the Kid (\"her throat is a kitchen\") and alluded to it in her lyrics for the song.  Manson later described the composition was \"a seduction, almost like a siren song\", \"I really like the vulnerable and sinister side of \"Milk\". It sounds like it's an innocuous love song and it's not\" and again elaborated further: \"It's been dismissed by people as the ballad at the end of the album. To me \"Milk\" is the darkest, most hopeless of the songs. People say \"Oh, it's lovey-dovey, so therefore it's a love song\". But it's a very bleak song, it's about loss and the fear of loss; about things you can't have and things you will forever wait for.\"\nAfter Garbage's fifth single \"Stupid Girl\" had been released internationally, the band's record label were considering what the follow-up single would be; at one point \"Supervixen\", \"Fix Me Now\", and \"Milk\" were all considered. The band performed a headline concert at New York City's Roseland Ballroom in mid-April 1996 and were joined at the aftershow by English trip hop musician Tricky. The two groups hung out for the night, and decided to collaborate on a duet version of \"Milk\" featuring both Manson and Tricky on vocals. In May, the two acts spent a session in Chicago's CRC Studios working on the new recording. The session was setback with numerous glitches including a malfunctioning tape machine and a mixing console caught fire. Manson found the experience of working with a male vocalist \"enchanting and"

It was released as their debut single in early 1995 by Discordant, a label set up by Mushroom Records to launch the group, and Almo Sounds in North America.\n\"Vow\" was quietly licensed to a Volume magazine/CD sampler publication at the end of 1994; it was subsequently picked up and broadcast by BBC Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq and John Peel, and then playlisted by modern rock radio stations in Los Angeles and Seattle. \"Vow\" generated such significant buzz through positive reviews and word-of-mouth that it was eventually chosen as Garbage's first single release. After a low-key independent record label pressing in the United Kingdom, where it was packaged in a very limited edition logo embossed aluminium case, \"Vow\" went on to top the alternative charts in Australia and register on the Hot 100 singles chart in the United States.\nThe song began as a demo during sessions between band members Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker, and the composition finished after singer Shirley Manson joined the band. The lyrics for \"Vow\" deal with themes of revenge and retaliation, and were inspired by a newspaper article on domestic abuse. In 2007, \"Vow\" was remastered and included as the opening track on Garbage's greatest hits compilation, Absolute Garbage.\n\"Vow\" began in rough demo form in January 1994, as band members Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker performed sessions in Marker's basement recording studio and Vig and Marker's own Smart Studios business in Madison, Wisconsin. After Marker saw Shirley Manson's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes, the band invited Manson to Smart Studios to sing on a couple of tracks. After a dreadful first audition, she returned to Angelfish, which folded shortly thereafter. Manson decided to test for Garbage again, and after the successful second audition, she began to work on the then-skeletal \"Queer\" and \"Vow\". While performing \"Vow\", Manson ad-libbed the lyrics \"I can't use what I can't abuse\" and \"like Joan of Arc coming back for more\". The song is written in the key of A minor, set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 126 beats per minute. It opens with Erikson playing a guitar through a noise gate \"with a lot of echo on it\", and has a chord progression is A\u2013C-F in the verses,  D-B\u266d-A-Em-D-B\u266d-F in the bridge, and F-C-D-G in the chorus, with a segue into F# minor in the interlude.\nAccording to Vig, the inspiration for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an abusive husband, \"so we thought it would be cool to get a bit of retribution in there.\" Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a sado-masochistic couple who could not keep away from each other. Lyrically, Manson claimed \"'Vow' is about having feelings [of vengeance]. You have to face your feelings of revenge and work out why you feel that way. It's about that conundrum when you're really angry but in reality you're in a pitiful state. Angry, twisted, but deep down, vulnerable.\" During promotion for the song, Garbage joked to journalists that \"Vow\" was about John and Lorena Bobbitt.\nGarbage had not initially planned to release \"Vow\" as their first single, as a single at all, or even include it on their debut album. The band felt that \"Vow\" was not representative of the album's genre-hopping body of work, although they later came to appreciate the situation that led to the song becoming their debut. Manson declared that \"now we can do whatever and people won't know what to expect\", but if the band had instead settled for \"of the more clubby tunes\" as a single, \"we would have been pigeonholed as a dance band and that's a hard tag to shake\".\n\nMidway through the recording sessions for the band's debut album, the band's label, Mushroom Records, secured the group an inclusion on Volume, a magazine that released compilation albums. However, the deadline given for accepting a track was only three days. The only song the band had completed in any shape or form was \"Vow\". After Volume was released in December 1994, \"Vow\" began to receive radio airplay from BBC Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq, John Peel and Johnnie Walker, and record stores in the United Kingdom began to receive requests for a single that did not yet exist. Word-of-mouth on \"Vow\" took the track back to the United States, where KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and KNDD in Seattle discovered the song, and put it into"

Written and composed by Busbee and Ben West, and produced by Greg Kurstin, it is a pop rock song about taking risks with love, no matter the consequences.\n\"Try\" received positive reviews from music critics who noted that it is one of the standout tracks on the album and called it a hit. Commercially, the song was a success, reaching number one in Spain and the top-10 in Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, while reaching the top-20 in most countries. The Floria Sigismondi-directed video features shots of a paint-covered Pink and her male love interest expressing their frustrations through contemporary dance.\nPink confirmed she was writing lyrics and composing music for her then untitled sixth album, which she titled The Truth About Love  eventually released, in September 2012. An early version of the album's lead single, a song called \"Blow Me (One Last Kiss),\" was leaked online on July 1, 2012, resulting in the single being released a week earlier than planned. Rachel Raczka from The Boston Globe noted that \"Try,\" the second single from The Truth About Love, also leaked in September 2012. The song was originally sung by GoNorthToGoSouth, a band fronted by Ben West and Michael Busbee. Originally they thought about giving the song to Kelly Clarkson then Daughtry; Adam Lambert recorded it, but according to Busbee, he \"just wasn\u2019t the right fit.\" The song was then eventually pitched to Pink. Pink's version of the song premiered on radio on September 6, 2012. \"Try\" was amongst one of five lyrics videos that Pink uploaded on September 12, along with album tracks \"Slut Like You,\" \"Just Give Me a Reason\" featuring Nate Ruess from fun., \"How Come You're Not Here,\" and \"Are We All We Are.\"\n\"Try\" was written and composed by Ben West and Busbee, while production was handled by Greg Kurstin, who also produced her previous single, \"Blow Me (One Last Kiss).\" It is a pop ballad modelled on 1980s FM Rock, built around two-volume arrangement, whereby the verses are quiet and the chorus is loud, according to Idolator's Carl Willot. Lyrically, it is an ode to taking risks with love, no matter the consequences. It also talks about hanging onto one's dreams and aspirations even if it means taking risks. \"Where there is desire there is gonna be a flame,\" sings Pink on the chorus. \"Where there is a flame someone's bound to get burned. But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die. You gotta get up and try.\"  Written and composed in the key of B minor with a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute, \"Try\" follows a chord progression of G-D-A-Bm (VI-III-VII-I) and Pink's vocals span two octave and a major third from D\u2083 to F#\u2085 (harmony).\nThe song received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised its production. Andrew Hampp of Billboard commented \"With a melody reminiscent of \u2018Whataya Want from Me,\u2019 the 2009 hit she penned for Adam Lambert, the single already pairs well sonically with Pink's catalog.\" Josh Langhoff of PopMatters called it \"an ode to romantic persistence over crisp \u2018Hysteria\u2019 guitars.\" Amy Sciarretto of Pop Crush wrote, \"It's a belter with a soulful voice, and she sounds like Kelly Clarkson with this song. The midtempo track finds Pink mourning, lamenting and musing on a relationship that is breaking down at its core. It hurts, but this song is a salve over the wound.\"\nDean Piper of Mirror Online wrote: \"The stand out track and an obvious international radio hit is \u2018Try.\u2019 Think how big and fabulous \u2018Who Knew\u2019 was \u2013 \u2018Try\u2019 is on the same wavelength.\" Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called it a \"keeper and an urging-to-victory battle cry,\" Robert Copsey of Digital Spy described it as \"a ballad of the stadium-filling, lighter-waving variety.\" while Caryn Ganz of Spin called it a \"breakup salve.\" Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song 4 out of possible 5, writing: \"Although she may not be treading new ground sonically, her passionate tones and solid determination will continue her chart presence - and rightly so.\" However, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine was less positive, writing that \"the midtempo \u2018Try\u2019 doesn't push Pink forward either, and it's marred by singsong lyrics.\" Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune also shared the same thought, writing: \"No one, not even Pink, can save lyrics such as these.\"\n\"Try\" debuted after the album's release at number 56 on the Billboard Hot 100, on the week"

It was written by Pink and Kara DioGuardi, with additional writing by Nate \"Danja\" Hills and Marcella Araica, while production was done by Danja, Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry. The song was released as the album's second single on October 31, 2008, firstly through digital download and later was added to U.S. radio stations on December 1, 2008. The power pop song talks about the quiet sense of comfort in being sober, with the singer claiming it was about the vices that we choose.\nThe song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended the track for being a heartfelt track, with some praising its lyrical content. However, few critics dismissed the track, calling it \"more of the same\" from her previous music. Furthermore, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 2010. Commercially, \"Sober\" attained success on the charts, reaching the top-ten in over thirteen countries, while reaching the top-twenty in the U.S., as well as the top of Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart. A music video for the track was directed by Jonas Akerlund and it finds Pink at a party with her doppelg\u00e4nger.\nIn February 2008, Pink announced that she and her husband Carey Hart had separated, which led the singer to write songs for a new album. It was confirmed that she was working with many music producers such as Butch Walker, Billy Mann, Eg White and Danja. While working on the album, she penned a track called \"Sober\" with Kara DioGuardi, claiming it was \"about the vices that we choose.\" She added, \"I had this idea in my head, 'like how do I feel this good sober?' So I brought that idea to Danja and with this awesome girl Kara DioGuardi and we wrote this song, Sober. And it's a pretty telling song and then me and Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry finished it, production-wise, threw some strings on it and made it a little bit darker and a little bit more rocky.\" Danja and Marcella Araica contributed to additional lyrics, with Danja, Kanal and Harry serving as the producers of the song. Araica, Harry and Jake Davis recorded the track at Sha Recording (Malibu, California), 3:20 Studios (Los Feliz, Los Angeles) and Henson Recording Studios (Virginia Beach, Virginia). Stevie Blacke arranged and performed all the strings, Jimmy Harry was also responsible for guitars and keyboards, while Tony Kanal provided bass.\n\"Sober\" was selected to be \"Funhouse\"'s second single, after the huge success of \"So What\". It received airplay before release in Australia on Today Network's stations and the Hot 30 Countdown and was the number one most added song on Australian radio. It was first released as a digital download on iTunes, on October 31, 2008, before being released to radio stations on December 1, 2008. While announced its release on her official website, Pink claimed, \"It\u2019s just a really, really personal beautiful song, one of my favorites.\u201d While reviewing the single, Alex Fletcher wrote for Digital Spy that the song is \"a dramatic U-turn from the brash and ballsy single 'So What', but reiterated that \"it's a better representation of her 'Funhouse' album\" than its lead single.\" Slant's Jonathan Keefe disagreed, calling it an \"oddly-chosen second single.\"\n\"Sober\" is a power pop song, featuring heavy guitars and booming snare. It is written in the key of E minor (recorded in D\u266f minor) and set at a moderately slow tempo of 91 beats per minute, following a chord progression of D\u266f5\u2013B5\u2013F\u266f. In the song, Pink's vocals span from the low-note of D\u266f\u2083 to the high-note of B\u2085. Lyrically, the song speaks about the quiet sense of discomfort in being sober. Lucy Davies of BBC Music went further, writing that the song \"discusses the blackouts resulting from drinking to avoid becoming those she sneers at.\" Chris William, writing for Entertainment Weekly, commented that the song finds Pink \"questioning her need to be numbed by booze and noise.\" Mark Blankenship of New Now Next analyzed the song, writing that it is \"about a woman who only loves herself when she\u2019s drunk, who wishes she could like herself this much when she\u2019s sober, but who can\u2019t seem to pull herself out of her spiral. She later discussed the song's lyrics in two interviews, stating:\nI wrote a song called \"Sober\", which is actually really dark. I was at a party at my own house, I didn't want to be there, I didn't want anyone else there. And I had this line in my head saying, 'How do I feel this good sober?', it's not just about alcohol, it's"

It was written by Pink and Kara DioGuardi, with additional writing by Nate \"Danja\" Hills and Marcella Araica, while production was done by Danja, Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry. The song was released as the album's second single on October 31, 2008, firstly through digital download and later was added to U.S. radio stations on December 1, 2008. The power pop song talks about the quiet sense of comfort in being sober, with the singer claiming it was about the vices that we choose.\nThe song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended the track for being a heartfelt track, with some praising its lyrical content. However, few critics dismissed the track, calling it \"more of the same\" from her previous music. Furthermore, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 2010. Commercially, \"Sober\" attained success on the charts, reaching the top-ten in over thirteen countries, while reaching the top-twenty in the U.S., as well as the top of Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart. A music video for the track was directed by Jonas Akerlund and it finds Pink at a party with her doppelg\u00e4nger.\nIn February 2008, Pink announced that she and her husband Carey Hart had separated, which led the singer to write songs for a new album. It was confirmed that she was working with many music producers such as Butch Walker, Billy Mann, Eg White and Danja. While working on the album, she penned a track called \"Sober\" with Kara DioGuardi, claiming it was \"about the vices that we choose.\" She added, \"I had this idea in my head, 'like how do I feel this good sober?' So I brought that idea to Danja and with this awesome girl Kara DioGuardi and we wrote this song, Sober. And it's a pretty telling song and then me and Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry finished it, production-wise, threw some strings on it and made it a little bit darker and a little bit more rocky.\" Danja and Marcella Araica contributed to additional lyrics, with Danja, Kanal and Harry serving as the producers of the song. Araica, Harry and Jake Davis recorded the track at Sha Recording (Malibu, California), 3:20 Studios (Los Feliz, Los Angeles) and Henson Recording Studios (Virginia Beach, Virginia). Stevie Blacke arranged and performed all the strings, Jimmy Harry was also responsible for guitars and keyboards, while Tony Kanal provided bass.\n\"Sober\" was selected to be \"Funhouse\"'s second single, after the huge success of \"So What\". It received airplay before release in Australia on Today Network's stations and the Hot 30 Countdown and was the number one most added song on Australian radio. It was first released as a digital download on iTunes, on October 31, 2008, before being released to radio stations on December 1, 2008. While announced its release on her official website, Pink claimed, \"It\u2019s just a really, really personal beautiful song, one of my favorites.\u201d While reviewing the single, Alex Fletcher wrote for Digital Spy that the song is \"a dramatic U-turn from the brash and ballsy single 'So What', but reiterated that \"it's a better representation of her 'Funhouse' album\" than its lead single.\" Slant's Jonathan Keefe disagreed, calling it an \"oddly-chosen second single.\"\n\"Sober\" is a power pop song, featuring heavy guitars and booming snare. It is written in the key of E minor (recorded in D\u266f minor) and set at a moderately slow tempo of 91 beats per minute, following a chord progression of D\u266f5\u2013B5\u2013F\u266f. In the song, Pink's vocals span from the low-note of D\u266f\u2083 to the high-note of B\u2085. Lyrically, the song speaks about the quiet sense of discomfort in being sober. Lucy Davies of BBC Music went further, writing that the song \"discusses the blackouts resulting from drinking to avoid becoming those she sneers at.\" Chris William, writing for Entertainment Weekly, commented that the song finds Pink \"questioning her need to be numbed by booze and noise.\" Mark Blankenship of New Now Next analyzed the song, writing that it is \"about a woman who only loves herself when she\u2019s drunk, who wishes she could like herself this much when she\u2019s sober, but who can\u2019t seem to pull herself out of her spiral. She later discussed the song's lyrics in two interviews, stating:\nI wrote a song called \"Sober\", which is actually really dark. I was at a party at my own house, I didn't want to be there, I didn't want anyone else there. And I had this line in my head saying, 'How do I feel this good sober?', it's not just about alcohol, it's"

RCA Records released the song for digital download and streaming on August 10, 2017, as the album's lead single. The song, which written by Pink, Johnny McDaid, and its producer Steve Mac, is an electronic dance music (EDM) track with upbeat dance production that blends repetitive chords, synthesizers, and drum machine beats. Pink, who was inspired by the politics of the time, composed it as a political protest song with poetic and inclusive lyrics. The song's lyrics explore Pink's belief the US government had failed people and sends a message about those who feel unheard or forgotten.\nMusic critics gave \"What About Us\" mostly positive reviews; many of them commended the production and Pink's vocal performance while others appreciated the song's political message and the anthemic nature of the composition. It peaked at number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and gave Pink her record-breaking ninth number-one song on the Adult Pop Songs chart, surpassing Katy Perry as the soloist with the most chart-topping songs on the chart. The song also reached number one on the national charts of eight countries, including Australia, Poland and Switzerland, and peaked within the top 10 in 12 other territories, including Canada and the United Kingdom. \"What About Us\" was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.\nAn accompanying music video for \"What About Us\" was directed by Georgia Hudson and released on August 16, 2017. It depicts Pink and members of minority groups performing several choreographed routines in an abandoned city while being chased by searchlights from hovering helicopters. The video received positive reviews from critics, who praised the choreography and the representation of oppressed groups, as well as the song's political theme. To promote the song, Pink performed it live at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, on Saturday Night Live, and on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, among other televised appearances, as well as her Beautiful Trauma World Tour (2018\u20132019). The song has been covered several times during live performances by other artists, including Kelly Clarkson and Liam Payne.\nAfter conducting The Truth About Love Tour (2013\u20132014) in support of her sixth studio album The Truth About Love (2012), Pink took a nearly-four-year hiatus to focus on her personal life and find inspiration. During the hiatus, she concentrated on her family and living \"a normal life\", which influenced her music. Fifty songs were composed throughout the development of Beautiful Trauma, including \"What About Us\".\n\"What About Us\" was written by Pink, Johnny McDaid and Steve Mac, and was produced by Mac. In an interview with Vulture, Pink talked about the experience of writing the song, stating, \"it was just another day I was angry about what's happening in the world\". The singer decided to have discussions and anecdotes with McDaid to develop ideas for the album's songs; McDaid said Pink had \"so much to say\" and expressed herself \"really profoundly\". \"What About Us\" was written and recorded during the session; according to Pink, \"those are those kinds of songs where it just falls out of you, that's why I think you're just a vessel when you're being creative\".\nWhen asked about the creation of the song, McDaid said:\nFrom my perspective the creation of it is about looking into yourself, interacting. It's like alchemy, you know, you interact with the person there in the room and\u00a0... these things, these ideas come out and what the ideas are for [Pink] are probably different to even the person hearing it. And that's the beauty of her, she really allows people to receive her music the way they do.\n\"What About Us\" is an upbeat EDM song, with a length of four minutes and twenty-nine seconds. The synthesizer-heavy production of the song makes use of \"pounding\" drums, \"glistening\" keyboards, and a \"pulsating\" dance beat. It draws influences from four on the floor, club, and electronic music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, \"What About Us\" is set in the time signature of common time and is composed in the key of A\u266d major with a moderate tempo of 114 beats per minute. It follows a chord progression of Fm\u2013D\u266d\u2013A\u266d with Pink's"

It was originally released in November 1990 on the record label Big Life and peaked at #87 on the UK Singles Chart.  The Orb also included it on their 1991 double album The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld.  \"Little Fluffy Clouds\" was re-released several times with different b-sides, with its 1993 re-release reaching #10 in the UK.\nIt ranked number 275 in NME's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Pitchfork Media ranked it at number 40 on their list of the Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s.\nAlex Paterson had previously worked with Jimmy Cauty as The Orb. Upon Cauty's departure from The Orb, Paterson began work on \"Little Fluffy Clouds\" with ex-Killing Joke member Martin \"Youth\" Glover.  However, because of other production obligations, Glover did not become a permanent member of The Orb. Kris \"Thrash\" Weston joined The Orb soon after.  Weston mixed and engineered several versions of \"Little Fluffy Clouds\", including the version on The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld.\n\"Little Fluffy Clouds\" makes extensive use of clips from an interview with American singer Rickie Lee Jones in which she recalls picturesque images of her childhood. Critics and fans sometimes attribute the odd nasal tone of Jones' voice to drug use, though Jones later said she had had a heavy cold.  The samples are widely believed to have come from a conversation between Jones and LeVar Burton on the children's television program Reading Rainbow, but in fact originated from an interview disc that was issued with some promotional boxed copies of her album Flying Cowboys. The interview was not conducted by Burton. The interviewer is not identified on the recording or in the boxed set's liner notes, though a 1993 profile in The Independent identifies him as \"an American DJ\" with a \"syrupy, Simon Bates-style tone.\"\nInterviewer: \"What were the skies like when you were young?\"\nJones: \"They went on forever \u2013 They - When I w- We lived in Arizona, and the skies always had little fluffy clouds in 'em, and, uh... they were long... and clear and... there were lots of stars at night. And, uh, when it would rain, it would all turn - it- They were beautiful, the most beautiful skies as a matter of fact. Um, the sunsets were purple and red and yellow and on fire, and the clouds would catch the colours everywhere. That's uh, neat 'cause I used to look at them all the time, when I was little. You don't see that. You might still see them in the desert.\"\nJones' record company was upset at the unauthorized use of her voice and initially sought to pursue a claim via the legal system. Big Life chose to settle out of court for an undisclosed sum of money for use of her voice on The Orb's recording: in 2016, Paterson said the record company paid $5,000 to use the sample. Asked about the sample in an interview years later, Jones referred to The Orb as \"those fuckers.\"\nThe song also uses a harmonica sample from Ennio Morricone's The Man With The Harmonica (from the film Once Upon a Time in the West) and parts of Electric Counterpoint, a piece for multi-tracked guitars composed by Steve Reich and recorded by Pat Metheny. According to Glover, the inspiration for the track came when an Orb fan who worked in a Birmingham record shop sent him a tape with Electric Counterpoint on one side and the Rickie Lee Jones interview on the other. Reich was \"genuinely flattered\" by The Orb's use of his work and instructed his record company not to sue. Despite this The Orb did receive a letter from Reich's lawyers several years later, but Paterson described Reich as \"a proper gentleman: he wanted 20% from then on and asked us to do a remix of one of his tunes, which we did\".  Alex Paterson also suggested that the drum track is sampled: \u201cIf anyone actually knew where the drums on 'Little Fluffy Clouds' came from, they'd all just die, but I'm not at liberty to tell. Record companies have always warned me, \u2018Don't tell anyone where you got your samples until we get them cleared!\u2019\u201d. He later said that the drum track was sampled from Harry Nilsson's album Nilsson Schmilsson, and others have specifically identified this as a sample of Jim Gordon's drum solo from \"Jump Into the Fire\", slowed down approximately from 45 to 33 rpm. The use of a slowed-down \"Jump Into the Fire\" was acknowledged by Paterson in a 2016 interview with The Guardian, in which he also said"

In 2011, \"Raise Your Glass\" was ranked at number thirteen on the \"Top 40 Year End Chart\" based on Mediabase.\nThe song was featured in a commercial for the 2011 film Bridesmaids, and in the theatrical trailers for the films What's Your Number? and New Year's Eve. Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause and Gleb Savchenko danced the tango to the song on the premiere of Dancing with the Stars.\n\"Raise Your Glass\" was announced as the lead single from Pink's then-upcoming greatest hits compilation on October 1, 2010. The song follows a strong pop style, in much similar fashion to her previous work with producer Max Martin.\nPink describes the song as a \"celebration for people who feel left out from the popular crowd.\" In an interview for MTV, Pink comments on the song: \"I don't know if it's going to be huge, but it is new. I did three new songs. It was good timing. I had been on the road for two years and I hadn't written anything and I wanted to write a song about underdogs. Instead of going and becoming a cover girl, I kind of just hit the road and pounded the pavement...and became a touring artist. You don't have to be popular when you're a touring artist, you just have to be good, and this is a thank you for the fans.\"\nThe song received acclaim from contemporary music critics. Nick Levine from Digital Spy was largely positive with the song, giving it 5/5 stars and describing it as \"a full-throttle pop/rock stomper with a chorus as subtle as a porn star's cleavage, some classic Pink ad-libs and the best so-dumb-it's-genius couplet of the year: 'Don't be fancy / Just get dancey'... after ten years of sterling service to all things pop, the (pink) champagne's on us.\" Becky Bain from Idolator said that \"Pink lifts her glass to toast all the 'dirty little freaks' in her new party track.\" Fraser McAlpine from BBC blog rated it 4/5 stars, saying that \"it has to SOUND like wild and crazy fun. It should probably rock, or at least claim to rock. There must be a big celebratory chorus, something which brings everyone together in a glorious celebration of Brand Pink. There should be a few silly one-liners, rampant abuse of the English language, a few extravagant claims, a strutting self-regard mixed with a giggling self-depreciation, a sneer and a smile.\"\nIn the United States, \"Raise Your Glass\" recharged Pink's chart performance, becoming her tenth Top 10 hit and her third number one hit. It put Pink third on the list of female artists with most Top 10 hits in the 2000s, behind Rihanna, who has collected 18 Top 10 hits since 2005 and Beyonc\u00e9, with 14. It took the song eight weeks to hit the Hot 100's apex, where it stayed for a single week. \"Raise Your Glass\" has also become Pink's fifth number one on Adult Pop Songs, giving her the most number ones on the chart of a female artist, and putting her in a tie with the band Nickelback for the most number ones on the chart out of all artists; in 2011, Katy Perry achieved her sixth no.1 in the chart, placing Pink and Nickelback at number two as artists with the most number ones. \"So What,\" Pink's only previous 3-million seller, reached that level in 26 weeks. As of August 2013, the single has sold 4,162,000 copies.\n\"Raise Your Glass\" reached #13 in the United Kingdom. However, in Australia, \"Raise Your Glass\" climbed to the top of the ARIA singles chart in 24 hours, it also debuted atop the Polish charts and German airplay charts, just like Pink's six previous singles. Therefore, Pink breaks the record she had set herself, as the artist with most consecutive number one singles on the chart. In New Zealand, the song peaked at number five on the RIANZ on the singles chart and reached number one on the radio airplay chart.\n\nThe music video for"

It was written by Pink and Kara DioGuardi, with additional writing by Nate \"Danja\" Hills and Marcella Araica, while production was done by Danja, Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry. The song was released as the album's second single on October 31, 2008, firstly through digital download and later was added to U.S. radio stations on December 1, 2008. The power pop song talks about the quiet sense of comfort in being sober, with the singer claiming it was about the vices that we choose.\nThe song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended the track for being a heartfelt track, with some praising its lyrical content. However, few critics dismissed the track, calling it \"more of the same\" from her previous music. Furthermore, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 2010. Commercially, \"Sober\" attained success on the charts, reaching the top-ten in over thirteen countries, while reaching the top-twenty in the U.S., as well as the top of Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart. A music video for the track was directed by Jonas Akerlund and it finds Pink at a party with her doppelg\u00e4nger.\nIn February 2008, Pink announced that she and her husband Carey Hart had separated, which led the singer to write songs for a new album. It was confirmed that she was working with many music producers such as Butch Walker, Billy Mann, Eg White and Danja. While working on the album, she penned a track called \"Sober\" with Kara DioGuardi, claiming it was \"about the vices that we choose.\" She added, \"I had this idea in my head, 'like how do I feel this good sober?' So I brought that idea to Danja and with this awesome girl Kara DioGuardi and we wrote this song, Sober. And it's a pretty telling song and then me and Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry finished it, production-wise, threw some strings on it and made it a little bit darker and a little bit more rocky.\" Danja and Marcella Araica contributed to additional lyrics, with Danja, Kanal and Harry serving as the producers of the song. Araica, Harry and Jake Davis recorded the track at Sha Recording (Malibu, California), 3:20 Studios (Los Feliz, Los Angeles) and Henson Recording Studios (Virginia Beach, Virginia). Stevie Blacke arranged and performed all the strings, Jimmy Harry was also responsible for guitars and keyboards, while Tony Kanal provided bass.\n\"Sober\" was selected to be \"Funhouse\"'s second single, after the huge success of \"So What\". It received airplay before release in Australia on Today Network's stations and the Hot 30 Countdown and was the number one most added song on Australian radio. It was first released as a digital download on iTunes, on October 31, 2008, before being released to radio stations on December 1, 2008. While announced its release on her official website, Pink claimed, \"It\u2019s just a really, really personal beautiful song, one of my favorites.\u201d While reviewing the single, Alex Fletcher wrote for Digital Spy that the song is \"a dramatic U-turn from the brash and ballsy single 'So What', but reiterated that \"it's a better representation of her 'Funhouse' album\" than its lead single.\" Slant's Jonathan Keefe disagreed, calling it an \"oddly-chosen second single.\"\n\"Sober\" is a power pop song, featuring heavy guitars and booming snare. It is written in the key of E minor (recorded in D\u266f minor) and set at a moderately slow tempo of 91 beats per minute, following a chord progression of D\u266f5\u2013B5\u2013F\u266f. In the song, Pink's vocals span from the low-note of D\u266f\u2083 to the high-note of B\u2085. Lyrically, the song speaks about the quiet sense of discomfort in being sober. Lucy Davies of BBC Music went further, writing that the song \"discusses the blackouts resulting from drinking to avoid becoming those she sneers at.\" Chris William, writing for Entertainment Weekly, commented that the song finds Pink \"questioning her need to be numbed by booze and noise.\" Mark Blankenship of New Now Next analyzed the song, writing that it is \"about a woman who only loves herself when she\u2019s drunk, who wishes she could like herself this much when she\u2019s sober, but who can\u2019t seem to pull herself out of her spiral. She later discussed the song's lyrics in two interviews, stating:\nI wrote a song called \"Sober\", which is actually really dark. I was at a party at my own house, I didn't want to be there, I didn't want anyone else there. And I had this line in my head saying, 'How do I feel this good sober?', it's not just about alcohol, it's"

It was released as the album's third official single on December 22, 2017 in Italy, and a piano version,  titled \"Joanne (Where Do You Think You're Goin'?)\", followed in the rest of the world on January 26, 2018. The track was written and produced by Gaga and Mark Ronson, with additional production from BloodPop. Inspired by the singer's late aunt, Joanne Germanotta, the song became a focal point for the musical direction of the album. Gaga intended the song to have a healing effect for those dealing with loss and pain.\nMusically, it is a country song with stripped-down acoustic composition. The lyrics talk about Joanne's death from the point of view of Gaga's family. The track was complimented for Gaga's vocals and the personal, stripped-down nature of the composition. Prior to being released as a single, \"Joanne\" had minor chart placements in France and the United Kingdom. Gaga performed \"Joanne\" at the 60th Grammy Awards and during her Joanne World Tour (2017\u20132018). It was also featured in the 2017 documentary Gaga: Five Foot Two, during a scene involving Gaga and her grandmother listening to the track.\nThe piano version of the song was accompanied by the release of a music video, which continued the loose storyline set in the previous videos for the album. The clip shows the singer belting the song around various natural settings and was critically praised. This version of the song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\nLady Gaga's deceased aunt, Joanne Germanotta, had a profound effect on the singer's life and career. Gaga included one of her aunt's unpublished poems on her first album's booklet, and tattooed the date of her death on her left arm. She had initially written a song called \"Paradise\", inspired by her aunt, while making her fourth studio album, Cheek to Cheek, in 2014 with Tony Bennett. However, the song was not included on the album. While developing her fifth studio album in 2016, Joanne, Gaga wrote its title track with producer Mark Ronson at Shangri-La Studios, where the rest of the album was crafted. Describing the song as \"the true heart and soul of the record\", Gaga emphasized how much Joanne had influenced her family and herself.\nJoanne died due to complications arising from the autoimmune disease lupus when she was 19 years old. In an interview, Gaga revealed that Joanne's lupus got more complicated after she experienced a sexual assault, and those complications resulted in her death. The incident affected the Germanotta family and according to Gaga, the grief never left them completely. Writing \"Joanne\" helped Gaga deal with her father's pain of losing his sister. During the New York City show of her Dive Bar Tour (2016), Gaga added that despite the song's relevance to her family, she wanted the track to appeal to everyone who had suffered the loss of any loved ones.\n\"My connection to her has been strong my whole life. I always wondered what it was\u2014the mystery of Joanne\u2014this person that I never got to meet that was an absolute tornado of both love and tragedy... She was a powerful, beautiful force in my family's life and then it's like a beautiful light that just goes out, so I've always used the fact that she didn't get to live the rest of her life as a sense of strength and power within me that I have to go out and live the rest for her.\"\n\"Joanne\" is an acoustic country ballad; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that it \"winks at\" Dolly Parton's \"Jolene\" (1973). In an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1, Gaga revealed that it was recorded in one take. The song is written in the time signature of common time with a moderately slow tempo of 74 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major, with Gaga's vocals ranging from E\u2083 to D\u2085. \"Joanne's\" chord progressions follow a basic sequence of G\u2013D\u2013C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013C during the verses, and C\u2013D\u2013Em\u2013C\u2013C/B\u2013Am\u2087\u2013D during the chorus. The album version runs for 3 minutes and 16 seconds while the piano version is 4 minutes and 39 seconds long.\nThe third track on the record, \"Joanne\" is the first time that the overall tempo of the album"

In 2010, it was released as the sixth single in North America, the only place of its release. Written by Pink and Billy Mann and Michele Mears, the song is a pop ballad with a soft piano accompaniment and pop drum beats. Its lyrics talk about the power of love and taking a leap in faith, while using various metaphors. \"Glitter in the Air\" received mixed reviews from contemporary critics: some named it the best vocal performance of Funhouse, while others criticized it for being a clich\u00e9 ballad.\n\"Glitter in the Air\" debuted at number 18 and 13 in the United States and Canada, respectively. In the United States, the song marked the first time Pink had five singles from one album chart on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was notably performed by Pink as part of her 2009 Funhouse Tour with her wearing a bodysuit and doing acrobatics using aerial tissue. A similar version of this performance was done at the 2010 Grammy Awards, where her performance received a standing ovation and was critically praised by media outlets. A similar version of these performances was also performed on The Truth About Love Tour.\n\"Glitter in the Air\" is a pop ballad, co-written by Pink while produced by frequent collaborator Billy Mann. The song is musically similar to another ballad from Funhouse, \"I Don't Believe You\", as both contain a soft piano and string accompaniment. According to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, \"Glitter in the Air\" is composed in the key of F major, with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Pink's vocal range spans from the high-tone of B\u266d\u2084 to the low-tone of F\u2083. Nekesa Mumbi Moody of the Associated Press commented that although the song did not display the power of Pink vocals, \"her voice is still potent, full of hurt and confusion that anyone can feel\". The song's lyrics talk about the power of love and taking a leap in faith. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters said the song \"reflect[s] on life's simple joys and simply savor[es] them just for what they are\".\nEvan Sawdey of PopMatters said, \"Of all the ballads, though, the quiet piano closer 'Glitter in the Air' takes the cake, never once overplaying its hand, remaining sweet without once ever succumbing to saccharine niceties (think of a Jason Robert Brown song without the vocal showboating). It's the sweetest moment on the entire disc, but it only succeeds because it's also the least complex song here\". Craig Emonds of The South End stated that while \"every song has potential to do well and is quite likable, [...] Pink's vocals are strong and shine particularly in the ballad 'Glitter In The Air'.\" Nekesa Mumbi Moodoy of the Associated Press said that \"What makes the song so moving is that despite all of the heartache, she doesn't appear gun-shy about taking the leap again\".\nJustin Pacheco of The Good 5 Cent Cigar compared it to \"I Don't Believe You\", saying, \"[it] exemplifies the sappy ballad [...] and would not seem out of place being sung by any other big pop singer. 'Glitter in the Air' is another big pop ballad along the same the same lines\". Patrick Ferrucci of the New Haven Register commented in the album review that \"She does get a little wishy-washy though, going from tunes like 'Mean' and 'It's All Your Fault' to 'Please Don't Leave Me' and 'Glitter in the Air'\". He also added that the high points of Funhouse were the four tracks produced by Max Martin. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine stated that one of the biggest problems in Funhouse was its songwriting, saying, \"'Glitter in the Air,' with its emo-esque \"You called me sugar\" bridge, is overwrought with its clich\u00e9d imagery\".\n\"Glitter in the Air\" impacted radio as a new single by her record label, minutes after her performance at the Grammy Awards. On February 11, 2010, the song debuted at No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100, with sales over 114,000 units. It became her fifth charting single from Funhouse in the United States, the most charting singles from one of her albums. The same week, it debuted at No. 13 on the Canadian Hot 100. The song also received significant airplay on U.S. adult radio, peaking at No. 8 on the Adult Top 40 chart, her fourth top-ten hit from the album on that chart.\n\"Glitter in the Air\" was performed by Pink on her 2009 Funhouse Tour.

While developing her fifth studio album in 2016, Joanne, Gaga wrote its title track with producer Mark Ronson at Shangri-La Studios, where the rest of the album was crafted. Describing the song as \"the true heart and soul of the record\", Gaga emphasized how much Joanne had influenced her family and herself.\nJoanne died due to complications arising from the autoimmune disease lupus when she was 19 years old. In an interview, Gaga revealed that Joanne's lupus got more complicated after she experienced a sexual assault, and those complications resulted in her death. The incident affected the Germanotta family and according to Gaga, the grief never left them completely. Writing \"Joanne\" helped Gaga deal with her father's pain of losing his sister. During the New York City show of her Dive Bar Tour (2016), Gaga added that despite the song's relevance to her family, she wanted the track to appeal to everyone who had suffered the loss of any loved ones.\n\"My connection to her has been strong my whole life. I always wondered what it was\u2014the mystery of Joanne\u2014this person that I never got to meet that was an absolute tornado of both love and tragedy... She was a powerful, beautiful force in my family's life and then it's like a beautiful light that just goes out, so I've always used the fact that she didn't get to live the rest of her life as a sense of strength and power within me that I have to go out and live the rest for her.\"\n\"Joanne\" is an acoustic country ballad; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that it \"winks at\" Dolly Parton's \"Jolene\" (1973). In an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1, Gaga revealed that it was recorded in one take. The song is written in the time signature of common time with a moderately slow tempo of 74 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major, with Gaga's vocals ranging from E\u2083 to D\u2085. \"Joanne's\" chord progressions follow a basic sequence of G\u2013D\u2013C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013C during the verses, and C\u2013D\u2013Em\u2013C\u2013C/B\u2013Am\u2087\u2013D during the chorus. The album version runs for 3 minutes and 16 seconds while the piano version is 4 minutes and 39 seconds long.\nThe third track on the record, \"Joanne\" is the first time that the overall tempo of the album"

It was released as soundtrack's second single in Italy and France in January 2019. The song was written by Lady Gaga, Natalie Hemby, Hillary Lindsey, and Lori McKenna, and produced by Dave Cobb and Lady Gaga.\nThe song has received widespread critical acclaim and has reached the top of the record chart in Iceland and the top ten in Belgium (both Flanders and Wallonia), Hungary, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Sweden and Switzerland, the digital charts of Luxembourg, Slovakia and the combined European chart. The track has also reached the top twenty in Denmark, Estonia, France, Malaysia, and on the digital chart of Czech Republic. It also reached the top twenty of the Australian and New Zealand charts, while achieving triple platinum certification from the former governing body.\nThe song received a nomination for Song of the Year at the 62nd Grammy Awards, the second nomination from the album in this category after \"Shallow\", which was nominated for the year before.\n\"Always Remember Us This Way\" was written by Lady Gaga, Natalie Hemby, Hillary Lindsey, and Lori McKenna, and produced by Dave Cobb and Gaga. It also features background vocals from Hemby, Lindsey and McKenna. Bradley Cooper had approached Cobb for crafting the sound of the album, after listening to the latter's work. Cobb flew out to Los Angeles and met Gaga and Cooper for a writing session. He played the track \"Maybe It's Time\" (written by singer-songwriter Jason Isbell), which impressed Gaga and Cooper and set the tone for the soundtrack. They asked Hemby, Lindsey and McKenna to come down to Los Angeles and start composing tracks.\n\"Always Remember Us This Way\" was released to Italian radios on January 4, 2019, followed by release in French radios two weeks later. A music video for the song was released previously, showing the sequence from the film when Gaga sings the track after being introduced by Jackson onstage, who sweetly tells her, \"I love you, I'll always remember us this way\". A vertical-shaped version of the clip was released to Spotify. Brooke Bajgrowicz from Billboard explained that the \"reflective video\" showed Ally and Jackson \"falling in love with each other\", while interspersed with scenes of the couple going on a motorbike ride, kissing in a parking lot and performing music together. The clip ends with the crowd chanting Ally's name, and Jackson walks over to embrace her.\n\"Always Remember Us This Way\" was recorded immediately after the songwriters finished composing it. They also provided backing vocals as Gaga recorded her vocals in the studio. Cobb said, \"It was pure magic when that went down and you can hear it in the film\u2014the energy and the excitement that was happening. It's amazing to hear that kind of voice come through headphones.\" Lindsey, who had previously collaborated with Gaga on her fifth studio album, Joanne (2016), recalled that the singer had imbibed in the character of Ally she was playing in the film completely. \"She was living in the hurt and ache of Ally losing the love of her life. We all just wanted to hug her. She was so broken up and in so much raw pain,\" Lindsey added. McKenna described the songwriting as a powerful moment because the lyrics made them all tearful, and they decided that if \"Maybe It's Time\" was Cooper's character Jackson's song, then \"Always Remember Us This Way\" belonged with Ally.\nAccording to Cobb it was magical when \"[Gaga] got in the vocal booth on the microphone and the writers were in the control room. I was playing with the band, and it just happened. Her voice was as big as the house. All of us had goosebumps. That happens very seldomly.\" The song is a piano-driven country ballad, which is \"pushed along\" by Gaga's raw, powerful vocals. Following the first verse being on piano, the guitars and drums kick in from the second verse and Gaga's vocals build up to the final chorus uttering the lines, \"When the sun goes down/ And the band won't play/ I'll always remember us this way\". The song is composed in the time signature of common time and is performed in the key of A minor with a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute. It follows a chord progression of Am\u2013F\u2013C\u2013G, and the vocals span from G\u2083 to E\u2085.\nThe song received widespread critical acclaim upon release. Jon Pareles of The"

It was written by Ester Dean and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, with lyrics reflecting the different perspectives on relationships and how one can perceive a relationship different from the outside. It opens with an electro-crescendo followed by Rowland's vocals which were produced by Emily Wright; the song's production is based upon layered synths and drums, programmed by Dr. Luke. Dean helped Rowland to record the song, which Rowland said made her cry as it reminded her of her own experiences in past relationships. \"Rose Colored Glasses\" also had an effect on Rowland's vocals, causing them to swell. The song was serviced to rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on June 29, 2010. Critics praised \"Rose Colored Glasses\" as one of Rowland's strongest vocal and emotional performances to date.\nThe arrangement and delivery were praised as being classy, while the critics felt that the overall emotion of the song gave Rowland the best chance of achieving US chart success. \"Rose Colored Glasses\" was released on June 28, 2010 across some parts of Europe, and a day later in the United States and Canada, where it was intended to be one of the album's two lead singles. An accompanying 3-D concept music video, directed by British fashion photographer John \"Rankin\" Wadell was released, featuring atmospheric visuals and mood-lit scenes including streamers, doves, and rose petals. Reception for the video was positive, praising its simplicity and noting the stunning visuals and variety of outfits worn by Rowland. The single had limited chart success, entering the top-forty radio airplay charts in Slovakia and the United States, but failing to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100. It is only included on international versions of Here I Am, which was released later in the year than the domestic (US) version of the album.\nAt the 2010 Winter Music Conference, Rowland confirmed she was ready to release the lead single from her third studio album. On March 29, 2010, during the conference, she debuted the David Guetta-helmed song, \"Commander\" with her live performance of the song. However, just prior to its release, Rowland's label (Universal Motown) confirmed that the song would only be fully released as a single in international markets. At the end of May 2010, Rowland announced that \"Shake Them Haters Off\", penned by singer-songwriter Ne-Yo, would be the American lead single for her third album. Prior to its release, \"Shake Them Haters Off\" was replaced by two new songs, one for urban  radio and one for contemporary hit radio. \"Rose Colored Glasses\" was unveiled as the pop lead single, and serviced to both contemporary and rhythmic radio on June 29, 2010. It was also released for digital download on June 29, 2010 in Canada and the United States. The urban single, \"Grown Woman\", was also serviced to urban, urban adult contemporary and rhythmic radio on June 29, 2010. At the time of this announcement, it meant that three singles would precede the album before its worldwide release. However, the album was pushed back into 2011, in which time two other singles to preceded the album \u2013 \"Forever and a Day\" (2010) and \"Motivation\" (2011).\n\u201cRose Colored Glasses\u201d is a mid-tempo electro ballad written by Ester Dean and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald. The song, which opens with an electro-crescendo followed by Rowland's vocals, has a layered synth production, courtesy of Dr. Luke. In the lyrics, Rowland \"explores the subtle ways that perspective can truly change everything...[telling] a story of a relationship that, on the outside, seems troubled.\"  Lizzie Goodwin, from entertainment website Gather.com, called the song an \"addition to your break-up/female empowerment playlist.\" Dean accompanied Rowland in the recording studios when she recorded the song.\n\nDuring an interview for Rowland's segment in the iheartradio concert series, it was revealed that \"Rose Colored Glasses\" had made Rowland cry.

It was written by Mike Pickering and Paul Heard, and produced by the band. The song peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart.\nHot on the heels of their single \"Sight for Sore Eyes\" and a Top 5 album Bizarre Fruit and a sold out UK Tour, M People released this single in a slight reshuffle, as \"Search for the Hero\" was meant to be the second single but the band were re-editing the Bizarre Fruit version to a more radio friendly edit so \"Open Your Heart\" was released instead. The band had been on holiday together over the New Year break in Grenada, while dance mixes of this single had been released early and on UK radio, Pete Tong had been rotating several mixes on BBC Radio 1.\nWilliam Cooper from AllMusic wrote that the song has a \"obvious dance appeal\" and a \"touch of '70s R&B in the mix\". Another editor, Jon O'Brien called it an \"uptempo\" stomper. Larry Flick from Billboard noted that it \"has already won the hearts of M People die-hards at club level, and it sports a hook that takes up instant residence in the brain upon impact.\" He added, \"Maestros Mike Pickering and Paul Heard blur, with notable finesse, the timeline dividing current house music trends and vintage Philly soul, while singer Heather Small continues to evolve into a smoky-voiced diva who may remind some of a club-minded Anita Baker. Smashing.\" Geir Rakvaag from Norwegian newspaper Dagsavisen called it \"heavenly\". Kendall Morgan from Dallas Morning News stated that \"she's the most fun when she's belting out guidance to a lover\". Music writer James Masterton in his weekly UK chart commentary, that it \"appears to be doing little more than recycling a formula, making for a hit that is doubtless well produced and immaculately performed yet is somehow rather tedious.\" Howard Cohen from The Miami Herald commented, \"Just try shaking the hook of the infectious first single, Open Up Your Heart, once its simple, call-to-the-dancefloor keyboard riff opens the drum- and bass-heavy tune.\" \nPan-European magazine Music & Media said that \"Bizarre Fruit is the album title, not forbidden fruit. So take a bite of it Continentals, there's no risk of being banned from paradise. Their best since Moving On Up.\" Tim Jeffery from Music Week's RM Dance Update deemed it \"a rather bland album track\", \"but this is M People and the familiar vocal style and crisp production are certainly enough to carry this track up the club and pop charts.\" Another editor, James Hamilton called it a \"typically facile foghorn gurgled canterer\". A reviewer from People Magazine noted the \"classic good hooks\" of the track and Small's \"booming alto [which] is hard to shake and, like her pineapple-shaped coif, impossible to ignore.\" Sarasota Herald-Tribune described it as \"bass-bombing\". Wayne Bledsoe from Scripps Howard wrote that it \"has Small storming out of the mix with Patti LaBelle-like authority\". Andrew Harrison from Select deemed it a \"severe disco pounder\". Charles Aaron from Spin said about \"Open Your Heart\"/\"Search for the Hero\" that \"this British disco collective is just a more conventional version of Ten City, but their thumping anthems give you a lift over a scenic bridge to a homey chorus that opens up like a window shade on a sunny day.\"\nThe single entered the chart outside the Top 10 at number 11, but ever growing airplay and the release of the exclusive second CD meant that sales surged from 63,000 copies in its first week to 78,000 copies in its second. The single climbed from number 11 into the Top 10 at number nine where it peaked, providing the band with their seventh consecutive top 10 hit in just two years since the release of How Can I Love You More. It spent in total four weeks in the top 10 and a total seven weeks on the Singles Chart.\nThe Bizarre Fruit album also underwent a resurgence in sales, re-entering the Album Chart Top 10 at number eight, so the band once again recorded simultaneous single and album Top 10s, being at numbers nine and eight, respectively in the first week of February 1995 like the last two singles.\nIt also became M People's second single to top the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in the US in May 1995.\nGenerally, radio support for the single grew relatively slowly, despite being serviced to radio in the first week of 1995, which is traditionally a very quiet time for single releases.

It was released in Australia on 24 November 2003 as the lead single from his debut album, Just as I Am (2003). The song was written by J\u00f6rgen Elofsson and John Reid for Network Ten's TV talent competition, Australian Idol's inaugural season. Recorded versions were made for both grand finalists, Sebastian and Shannon Noll, with only Sebastian's version officially released by BMG. On 22 November the promotional video had premiered on the same network's Video Hits \u2013 produced by Australian Idol's Stephen Tate and directed by its musical director, John Foreman.\n\"Angels Brought Me Here\" peaked at number-one on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was the first of 12 top ten and six number-one singles for Sebastian in Australia. \"Angels Brought Me Here\"'s first week sales were at the time the highest one week's sales on record for both an Australian artist and a debut artist. It currently still has the second highest one week sales for an Australian artist single. The song was certified as five\u00a0times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and sold in excess of 350,000 units. In January 2010 \"Angels Brought Me Here\" was announced as the highest selling single of the decade (2000\u20132009). Until 2011 the song held the record as the highest selling Australian artist single in Australian chart history. \"Angels Brought Me Here\" was also popular in New Zealand, topping the RIANZ Singles Chart and achieving platinum certification. In October 2004, Lisa B. Bermingham published Sebastian's official biography, Angels Brought Me Here.\n\"Angels Brought Me Here\" was performed on 9 November 2003 by the final two contestants, Guy Sebastian and Shannon Noll, during the penultimate episode of Network Ten's TV talent competition, Australian Idol (2003). Both contestants were recorded and had their versions pressed by BMG, ready for the winner's version to be released immediately after the competition. Sebastian's winning performance was watched by an Australian record audience \u2013 for a non-sporting event \u2013 of 3.65 million. On 19 November he did an encore performance of the song and the single was issued in Australia on 24 November by BMG.\nSebastian referred to \"Angels Brought Me Here\", his winning moment on Australian Idol and his progress through the competition:\nI reckon it really sums up just what I felt as far as the competition goes. It's a very overwhelming process to go through and you really do feel that there's something else that got you there. Especially with how I didn't feel confident before and then something just clicked and I could look people in the eyes and really try and deliver a song.\nSebastian believes it is \"a great, inspirational song\" that summarises how any Australian Idol winner would have felt. Noll, however, felt that the song was too difficult for him to sing. Sebastian's version was produced by Bryon Jones (member of Rockmelons) and Adam Reilly (who was also the programmer). The B-side, \"When I Get You Alone\" \u2013 a cover version of Robin Thicke's 2002 single \u2013 was recorded live on Australian Idol episode \"Up Close & Personal\" in October 2003. Sebastian's second single, \"All I Need Is You\", followed in February 2004 and also debuted at number-one. In September, his third number-one single in a row, \"Out with My Baby\", was issued from his second album, Beautiful Life (2004). He has since achieved three further number-one singles in Australia,  \"Like It Like That\" in 2009, \"Who's That Girl\" in 2010, and \"Battle Scars\" in 2012.\nLisa B. Bermingham's official biography of Sebastian is titled, Angels Brought Me Here (October 2004) (aka Guy Sebastian: Angels Brought Me Here: The Official Biography). In November 2010, two versions of \"Angels Brought Me Here\" appeared on Sebastian's 2\u00d7CD compilation album, Twenty Ten: both the original and a newly recorded acoustic version. For the acoustic version, Sebastian also plays piano and is the"

In it, Lyte talks about casually having sex with men whom she later \"refuse to call 'em back\", in addition to responding to those who are upset about it \"It ain't worth it for the moment or the minute/You was in it then you want it but, no, now ya done, kid.\" In the third verse it seeks to convey a message anti-violence against women \"I only here for the righten night/To be hit not smack not slapped or kicked/So if you coming my way you gotta be strong/Strong enough to know that hitting a women is wrong.\"\nIn a review from May 2017, the website dedicated to hip hop music The Boombox considered I Go On as \"the best examples of Lyte flipping the gender script.\"\nThe song contains a riff sample from \"Been So Long\" by Anita Baker and the hook is based on interpolations from \"La Di Da Di\" by Doug E.

Also included in the single version of the song is a remix by Walter \"Mucho\" Scott titled \"I Go on (Gangsta Mix)\", which in turn samples the riff of \"Young, Gifted and Black\" by Aretha Franklin.\n\n\n\"I Go On\" (LP Version) (4:47)\n\"I Go On\" (Midnight Mix) (4:05)\nProduced by Chris Smith\n\"I Go On\" (Midnightstrumental) (7:20)\nProduced by Chris Smith\n\"I Go On\" (Gangsta Mix) (5:15)\nProduced by Walter \"Mucho\" Scott\n\"I Go On\" (Accapella) (4:53)\n\"Ruffneck\" (Beatnut Remix) (3:26)\nRemixed by The Beatnuts\n\n\"I Go On\" (LP Version) (4:47)\n\"I Go On\" (Midnight Mix) (4:05)\nProduced by Chris Smith and Teddy Riley\n\"I Go On\" (LP Version) (4:47)\n\"I Go On\" (Midnight Mix) (4:05)\nProduced by Chris Smith and Teddy Riley\n\n\"I Go On\" (LP Version) (4:47)\n\"I Go On\" (Midnight Mix) (4:05)\nProduced by Chris Smith\n\"I Go On\" (Midnightstrumental) (7:20)\nProduced by Chris Smith\n\"I Go On\" (Gangsta Mix) (5:15)\nProduced by Walter \"Mucho\" Scott\n\"I Go On\" (Accapella) (4:53)\n\"Ruffneck\" (Beatnut Remix) (3:26)\nRemixed by The Beatnuts\nCredits are taken from the liner notes.\nLyrics By \u2013 Lyte\nProducer, Engineer, Music By \u2013 Franklyn Grant\nProducer, Music By \u2013 Markell Riley, Tyrone Fyffe\nEngineer [Additional] \u2013 George Mayers, John Haynes\nMastered By \u2013 Amelia Moore, Jose Rodriguez\nExecutive Producer \u2013 Nat Robinson\n\n\"MC Lyte - I Go On [Vinyl Single] (12 inch Vinyl Single - Atlantic #95995)\".

Produced by Wolf & Epic, it was released on April 9, 1992.\nIn the song Lyte talks about social issues such as AIDS, crack and teenage pregnancy.\nIn May 1992 \"Eyes Are the Soul\" peaked No.\u00a084 on the Billboard's Hot R&B Singles.\nIn each verse of the song, Lyte describes a different afflicted person. The first person in the narrative is a male with HIV\u2013AIDS, the second person is a crack addict wanted by the law, and the third is a young, black, pregnant teenager who is considering abortion.\nShortly after the single was released, speaking at a Baltimore school, she confessed that \"Sometimes I get discouraged when I do songs like this and they don't get as popular as (others). I'm just trying to get the message out.\"\nDuring an interview with Ebony in 2012, Lyte commented on the song's AIDS prevention message:\n\"I can't even tell you that I had lost someone or that I knew of anyone who had lost someone(...) I just knew this disease was on its way to causing devastation in the world, but specifically in our communities, and that knowledge just scared the mess out of me.\"\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" was included on her compilation albums The Very Best of MC Lyte (2001), Rhyme Masters (2005), and Cold Rock a Party \u2013 Best of MC Lyte (2019) The music video was included on the compilation video album Lyte Years (1991).\nConnie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times highlighted the song in her album review, saying \"AIDS, crack addiction and teen pregnancy are topics treated with nonjudgmental empathy.\" James Bernard of Entertainment Weekly called the song \"my own favorite\", commenting \"Lyte slips into a storytelling mode to convey the anguish of her peers who are grappling with AIDS, drug addiction, and the specter of the abortion clinic. Rather than tossing around empty rhetoric, Lyte takes us face-to-face with these people, forcing us to look into their eyes.\"\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic's Alex Henderson also highlighted the song, describing it as \"a poignant reflection on the destruction caused by crack cocaine\". In a 2010 review, Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters commented on the song \"In \u201cEyes Are the Soul\u201d, MC Lyte turns the eyes into symbols of our collective humanity. There's a frailty in this symbolism, one that is echoed by the swelling synth backdrop and busy but light percussion.\" further highlighting its similarities to the TLC hit song \"Waterfalls\".\nIn the book Stare in the Darkness: The Limits of Hip-hop and Black Politics (2011), political scientist Lester Spence commented on the song:\n\"MC Lyte firmly places the responsibility for their condition on their own shoulders. The HIV\u2013AIDS victim contracted the disease because he was irresponsible and did not know the woman with whom he was both sleeping and sharing needles. The crack addict is addicted because his mother was an addict. The final instance?\n'I've watched her grow, little girl down the street\nWhite shirts and skirts with pleats/She cried, fear in her voice/Not knowing, she had a choice'\n\nIn each case, Lyte evinces sympathy and warmth toward the victim. By depicting the girl as she was when she was a child, Lyte depicts her as a young innocent and, in so doing, evokes sympathy from the listener. However, even in her sympathy, she frames the issue as one of individual knowledge. If the girl knew more, just as if the HIV\u2013AIDS victim had better control, she wouldn't be in the situation she's in. There is no consideration of larger structural forces that shape access to material resources or even of the knowledge that Lyte suggests is the solution.\"\n\n\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Soul Remix) (4:10)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Jazzy Soul Remix) (5:24)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (LP Version) (3:53)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Soul Remix Instrumental) (4:10)\n\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Soul Remix) (4:10)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Jazzy Soul Remix) (5:24)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (LP Version) (3:53)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Soul Remix Instrumental) (4:10)\nCredits are taken from the liner notes.\nLyrics By \u2013 MC Lyte\nMixed By \u2013 Carman Rizzo\nMusic By \u2013 Bret Mazur, Richard Wolf\nProducer \u2013 Wolf & Epic\n\"MC Lyte - Eyes Are the Soul (12 inch Vinyl Single - Atlantic #96188)\".

The track was released as the album's fifth and final single in April 1987. The single peaked at No.\u00a018 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart, No.\u00a03 in New Zealand, No.\u00a07 in the United States Billboard Hot 100, and No.\u00a010 on the Canadian RPM 100.\nThe track lends its title to the book, Crowded House: Something So Strong (1997), by Australian biographer Chris Bourke, which details the band's career from forming to just after their breakup in 1996. According to Bourke, \"Something So Strong\", was the first song written by Finn specifically for Crowded House. However while in the studio, producer, Froom, and Finn reworked parts of the song and as such, Froom is credited as a co-writer. Demos of this song have been linked to Finn's earlier band Split Enz, from the 1984 See Ya 'Round period, potentially making the timeline earlier on this track.\nA music video was produced to promote the single, of the band singing the song in a barn. A classic American car is parked outside while they perform.\nThe song, though in a different version by Crowded House, plays during the end credits of the 1999 Bryan Brown film, Dear Claudia.\nThe track is included in the various artists' 3\u00d7 CD, Flood Relief: Artists for the Flood Appeal (January 2011), which raised money for victims of the Queensland floods. A sample of \"Something So Strong\" plays during a TV spot of Flood Relief.\nThe song can also be heard in the Young Sheldon episode \u201cA Computer, a Plastic Pony, and a Case of Beer\u201c.\nJunkee said the song was, \"rightfully revered as a staple in the band\u2019s discography, but admittedly the shine of the original has worn off somewhat with its dated, reverb-heavy production.\"\n\"Something So Strong\" written by Neil Finn and Mitchell Froom.

It is the first track and single from their eleventh studio album 90125, released in November 1983. Written primarily by guitarist and singer Trevor Rabin, contributions were made to the final version by singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, and producer Trevor Horn.\n\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" was released in October 1983, as the album's first single. It was a commercial success in the United States, becoming the band's first and only single to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and its Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. In 1984, the song reached No. 8 in the year-end charts in the US. The single was reissued various times throughout the 1980s and 1990s with different remix versions and B-sides.\n\nThe song originated in 1979 from South African musician, singer-songwriter, and producer Trevor Rabin; while going to the toilet, he wrote \"the whole thing, from beginning to end\". Rabin then put down his ideas onto tape using his home equipment which included a 4-track tape machine. One of the recordings consisted of the main verse and chorus riff played on an acoustic guitar with some vocals. A developed version with drums, keyboards, and a complete set of lyrics was completed in 1980. Both recordings were released on Rabin's demo compilation album 90124, in 2003. For the full version, Rabin used the first and second tracks to record the instruments and vocals before mixing the song onto the third. He added: \"You would be making decisions based on what was coming, and sometimes those decisions would be wrong \u2013 but you couldn't undo them. One of the things, a happy accident, was that all of the brass stabs and those weird things that happen on the record \u2013 they were just a product of what happened with the demo\".\nAfter relocating to Los Angeles in 1981, Rabin added the song to his collection of demos that he wished to develop for a fourth solo album. Among the record labels that Rabin pitched his work to was Arista Records, but he recalled owner Clive Davis rejecting them on the basis of the songs sounding \"too strange, and would not be a hit\", and suggesting that Rabin \"write stuff more like Foreigner and then come back. I never did\". Rabin then landed a development deal with Geffen Records who introduced Rabin to musicians with the intention of forming Asia, but Rabin declined due to the lack of chemistry and his preference for making a solo album.\nRabin's deal with Geffen ended in 1982, but an offer from A&R man Ron Fair of RCA Records was the first time Rabin's songs were recognised as potential hits. Rabin said Fair called \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" \"a game changer\" and offered him an album deal on the strength of it. However, Rabin turned it down when he agreed to form a new band with bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White of the progressive rock band Yes and make an album, initially under the name Cinema, for Atco Records. Much of the new material derived from Rabin's demos, including \"Hold On\" and \"Changes\", and displayed a more pop-oriented approach than what Yes had been known for. The group worked with former Yes singer Trevor Horn as their producer.\nBy January 1983, most of the backing tracks and vocals for the Cinema album had been recorded, but an additional song was needed. While Rabin was on a toilet break, Horn left his demo tape running and heard his version of \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\". He disliked Rabin's inclinations toward \"American rock\" in his songs and its verse lyrics, which he remembered as: \"You don't wanna go dancing, you won't even answer the phone. You so scared of romancing, everything you do is alone\". However, he recognised the \"powerful\" introduction with its \"snap jump cut\" into the main riff, plus its strong chorus hook, as a hit single. \"The verses of it were so awful that I was convinced that if we didn't put loads of whizz, bangs and gags all over the verse that no one would ever listen to it\".\nHorn recalled pleading with the band to record it on the grounds that they needed a hit single, despite the group's reluctance. Subsequent musical and lyrical changes were then made by Horn and Squire, and for several days the group attempted to perform it. Horn was dissatisfied with the addition of various drum fills and superfluous sections, and suggested they record it \"straight and simple\" without changing the original riff. Rabin agreed to change his"

The song was released as the album's second single on 15 March 2009. It became the duo's breakthrough single, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Dubstep producers Skream and Skrillex both made remixes of the track. In 2011, \"In for the Kill\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.\nFrontwoman Elly Jackson told Steve Harris of Xfm radio that the song is \"about telling someone how you feel regardless of what you get back, and not waiting to find out if they want you or not.\" The track is heavily influenced by the title theme of the 1980s animated television series Pole Position, with the music video paying homage to the show as well.\n\"In for the Kill\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Digital Spy reviewer David Balls described the song as \"slightly odd, endlessly exciting\" and stated that it \"manages to sound quaintly old-school and positively futuristic all at the same time.\" Francis Jolley of Clickmusic praised it as \"80s synth pop at its most glorious\", naming it \"the most exciting single around.\" In a review for Exclaim!, Cam Lindsay wrote that the track \"features some icy, high-pitched woos from Jackson and pulse-pounding beats\" which make it sound \"delicious\". MSN Music called it a \"damn fine electro pop humdinger\" and complimented Jackson's powerful vocals which \"hit the ground running and burst with effervescence from the opening note.\"\nIn October 2011, NME placed the song at number 64 on its list of the \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\n\"In for the Kill\" debuted at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending 28 March 2009. Four weeks after its debut, the song peaked at number two with 51,724 copies sold. The single spent four consecutive weeks at number two, before falling to number three with sales of 44,310 copies. In January 2011, \"In for the Kill\" was named the 11th best-selling download in the United Kingdom of all time. The song had sold 875,523 copies in the UK as of July 2014. In Ireland, the track debuted at number 47 on 16 April 2009 and peaked at number 13, four weeks later.\n\"In for the Kill\" was less successful in continental Europe, charting at number 43 in Belgium, number 53 in Austria, number 68 in Slovakia and number 92 in Germany. It nevertheless reached number 11 in Norway, as well as number nine on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. The single debuted at number 50 in Australia on 29 June 2009, but fell off the chart the next week. On 13 July 2009 it re-entered the chart at number 46, peaking at number 36, two weeks later. In the United States, \"In for the Kill\" topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart on the issue dated 27 November 2010, becoming the duo's second number-one song on the chart after \"Bulletproof\".\nThe first music video for \"In for the Kill\" was directed by Kinga Burza and produced by Sarah Tognazzi. The 1980s-inspired video features Jackson singing the song while driving a Toyota MR2. It begins with Jackson driving down a dark road at night. At the beginning of the chorus, she puts on a pair of sunglasses, removing them at the chorus' end. During the instrumental section of the song, she waves her hand out of the car window, at which point the road ahead and the cloud-covered moon is visible. Jackson continues to drive until she comes across another version of herself standing in the middle of the road. The video concludes with Jackson driving the car, her eyes glowing white.\nA second video was released on 7 October 2010 to promote the US release of the single, featuring a slightly altered version of the song. The video was directed by LEGS and filmed at the Hotel Chelsea in New York City.\nDubstep musician Skream produced the most well-known remix of the song, titled the Let's Get Ravey remix, which was included on the CD single and digital EP. The remix was featured during the closing credits of the Entourage episode \"Hair\", originally aired 8 August 2010, as well as in television commercials for the 2009 fantasy video game Bayonetta and in the trailer for the 2012 film Dredd. It is also part of the soundtrack to Matchstick Productions' 2011 ski film Attack of la Ni\u00f1a.\nSkream's remix received positive reviews from music critics. The Observer reviewer Gareth Grundy called it a \"proper remix, the kind that nudges the original song into thrilling new territory.\" Cam Lindsay of Exclaim! wrote that while the original version \"features"

The pop song was written by Cabello, Ali Tamposi, Andrew Watt, Jon Bellion, Jordan Johnson, Stefan Johnson, Lionel Richie, Jenny Berggren, Jonas Berggren, Malin Berggren, and Ulf Ekberg. Production was handled by Watt, The Monsters & Strangerz and Bellion. It was released by Epic Records and Syco Music as a double single with \"Shameless\" on September 5, 2019. \"Liar\" consists of trumpets, bass drums and horns, and contains samples of Richie's 1983 song \"All Night Long (All Night)\" and Ace of Base's 1992 song \"All That She Wants\". The lyrics depict Cabello's rekindled emotions for a former partner.\n\"Liar\" peaked at number 21 on the UK Singles Chart, number 31 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, and at number 52 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was certified platinum in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Norway, Poland, and the United States. An accompanying music video was directed by Dave Meyers and depicts Cabello trapped inside a time loop sequence. The time loop was compared to Groundhog Day (1993) and Russian Doll (2019), while the music video itself was compared to Inception (2010). Cabello performed the song at several televised events.\nFrom August 31 to September 1, 2019, Cabello posted several teasers regarding her second project titled Romance (2019) to her social media accounts, which were scheduled to be released on September 5, 2019. The teasers included an image of Cabello seated around pillars signed 'R', a spoken-word video about love, and a clip of a key unlocking her mechanical heart. The first installment for the project was announced on September 3, 2019, as she uploaded a 15-second video of tarots displaying the names of the double singles \"Shameless\" and \"Liar\". Cabello explained her decision to release both songs simultaneously in a 2019 interview with Zach Sang, stating that she wanted people to become familiar with the sound of Romance. The senior vice president of Epic Records, Sandra Afloarei acknowledged that the dual promotion of both songs had a positive impact on radio stations and considered it to be \"a sign of the times\".\nMusically, \"Liar\" is a pop song, which contains an \"island vibe\", reggae, and pan-Caribbean and Spanish m\u00e9lange influences. It samples Lionel Richie's 1983 song \"All Night Long (All Night)\" and Ace of Base's 1992 song \"All That She Wants\", which provides a jazz element to the song. \"Liar\" opens with a combination of trumpets, dance-based bass drums, and mariachi-inspired horns. Elements of Latin trap and flamenco are accompanied by electronic handclaps, which leads to the ska-pop chorus. It rapidly cycles through styles of \"salsa, reggaet\u00f3n, flamenco, ska, [and] ballad[s]\".\n\"Liar\" was written by Cabello, Alexandra Tamposi, Andrew Wotman, Jonathan Bellion, Jordan Johnson, Stefan Johnson, Jenny Berggren, Jonas Berggren, Malin Berggren, Ulf Ekberg and Lionel Richie, and produced by Wotman, The Monsters and the Strangerz and Bellion. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song was composed using  common time in the key of B minor. Cabello's vocal range spans from the low note of F\u266f3 to the high note of F\u266f5, giving the song a two octave vocal range. Throughout \"Liar\", Cabello \"moans, whispers, and whimpers\". The lyrics describe her experience of expressing feelings for a former partner, as she \"seductively\" claims to be a liar since \"their hearts are so intertwined\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that Cabello \"sings about how a certain kiss makes her lose control\", while Rolling Stone writer Brittany Spanos noted that she \"fall[s] deeper in love\" during the chorus' lyrics, \"Oh no, there you go / Making me a liar / Got me begging you for more / Oh no, there I go / Startin' up a fire\".\nPareles wrote that \"Liar\" is a song which \"border-hop[s] at the speed of pop\". He listed the song at number 20 on his list of \"The 54 Best Songs of 2019\" and opined that is \"a lighthearted plaint about the power of lust\" which \"work[s] nimbly and globally to hold elusive the pop attention span\".\n\"Liar\" debuted at number 56 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart dated September 21, 2019. It peaked at number 52 on the chart dated November 2, 2019, and"

Produced and co-written by her and Diplo, the song features an interpolation of English rock band the Clash's 1982 song \"Straight to Hell\", leading to its members being credited as co-writers. A downtempo alternative hip hop track combining African folk music elements, the song has a less dance-oriented sound compared to other songs on the album. Its lyrics, inspired by M.I.A.'s own problems obtaining a visa to work in the US, satirise American perceptions of immigrants from Third World nations.\n\"Paper Planes\" was released in February 2008 as the album's third single by XL Recordings in Europe and Interscope Records in the US. The accompanying music video, filmed in Bedford-Stuyvesant, depicts M.I.A. as an undercover dealer and features images of paper planes flying overhead. While the video proved popular on MTV, the network censored the song's cannabis reference and gunshot sounds, which disappointed M.I.A. The song was M.I.A.'s biggest commercial success, entering the top 20 on charts in several countries including Denmark and the UK. It peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming MIA\u2019s first top 10 hit at the time. The song was certified multi-platinum in Canada and the US, platinum in the UK and gold in New Zealand.\nThe unexpected success of \"Paper Planes\" paralleling M.I.A.'s condemnations of the Sri Lankan government's acts of genocide against the Tamils, with whom M.I.A. shares ethnic and cultural backgrounds, generated accusations of her supporting terrorism. The song received widespread acclaim from contemporary critics, who complimented its musical direction and the subversive, unconventional subject matter. It won awards from the Canadian Independent Music Awards and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), and earned a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year. The song has received praise in publications such as NME, Pitchfork and Rolling Stone, each naming it among either the best songs of the 2000s decade or of all time.\nM.I.A. (Mathangi \"Maya\" Arulpragasam) released her debut studio album Arular in 2005 to critical acclaim. The album, inspired by her father Arul Pragasam's involvement in the Tamil independent movement in Sri Lanka, heavily incorporates themes of conflict and revolution into dance songs. While M.I.A. wanted to work with American producer Timbaland for Arular's follow-up album Kala (2007), her application for a long-term US work visa was rejected. This was allegedly due to her family's connection to the Tamil guerrillas, commonly known as the Tamil Tigers, a claim M.I.A. denied. Her visa problems were also attributed to her criticism of the Sri Lankan government's discrimination and alleged atrocities committed against the Tamils, with whom M.I.A. shares an ethnic and cultural heritage. She expressed this on her politicised album Arular.\nM.I.A. began work on \"Paper Planes\" with American producer Diplo and English DJ Switch in London. The track's downtempo production sets it apart from the rest of Kala, which features dense electronic sounds. Diplo came up with the idea of sampling English rock band the Clash's 1982 song \"Straight to Hell\" and produced the instrumental track with assistance from Switch. As a result, all members of the Clash were credited as co-writers. M.I.A. said that she recorded her vocals without paying much attention to her singing and finished the song in one take. She drew inspiration for the lyrics from her own troubles gaining a work permit to the US, complaining that the issue was probably \"them thinking that I might sic to fly a plane into the Trade Center\". From her frustration with US immigration policy, M.I.A. developed \"Paper Planes\" as a satire of American perception of immigrants from war-torn countries.\nM.I.A. invited street kids she came across in Brixton to sing the song's chorus. After regaining entry to the US, M.I.A. finalised the track at her home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a Brooklyn neighbourhood with a high concentration of African Americans, in mid-2007. She"

The song features a guest appearance from English musician Mr Hudson and background vocals from Kid Cudi. West handled the production, with co-production from Bhasker and Plain Pat. The song was written by the producers alongside Consequence and Kid Cudi. It was serviced to top 40 radio stations in the United States on March 23, 2009, as the fourth and final single from the album. An upbeat new wave track, the song features electronic drum effects and pop synths. Its lyrical content is centered around West being pushed away by the mistrustful thinking of a woman that he is in love with.\nThe song received generally positive reviews from music critics, with the majority of them being complimentary towards the production, while some critics compared \"Paranoid\" to the works of other artists. It charted at numbers 14 and 90 on the Belgium Ultratip Wallonia chart and ARIA Singles Chart, respectively, in 2009. That same year, the song reached number 18 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, and has since been certified gold in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). West and Mr Hudson have performed the song live together on numerous occasions, including at the 2009 iTunes Festival. An accompanying music video, directed by Nabil Elderkin and starring Rihanna, was released on June 3, 2009. Based around a fantasy from her paranoid mindstate, the video sees her going through a dream sequence. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. A remix, featuring Mr Hudson and rapper Big Sean, was released in December 2008. Since its release, the song has been covered by both the Suzan and Kali Uchis.\nWest produced \"Paranoid\", while the song was co-produced by American record producers Jeff Bhasker and Plain Pat. The producers co-wrote it with Consequence and rapper Kid Cudi. Outside of his feature on the song, Mr Hudson helped write and produce fellow 808s & Heartbreak tracks \"Say You Will\" and \"Street Lights\". The musician received a phone call from West while on vacation in Paris; West was drawn in by his charm and subsequently recruited him for \"Paranoid\". After featuring Mr Hudson on the song, West signed him to his record label GOOD Music. The musician subsequently released his debut studio album Straight No Chaser under GOOD Music in October 2009, with West contributing vocals on the single \"Supernova\". West and Kid Cudi first met each other at a Virgin Megastore in 2004, with the meeting including Cudi requesting West to sign him; West respectfully declined the request, though the rapper told him, \"I have the potential for greatness.\" After Plain Pat sent West Kid Cudi's debut mixtape A Kid Named Cudi (2008), West arrived at the mixtape's listening party and took Cudi under his wing. He subsequently co-wrote several songs on the album in Hawaii with West, including \"Paranoid\" and \"Heartless\". Kid Cudi has been believed to have directly influenced the album's creation, which West himself confirmed as being true. 808s & Heartbreak track \"Welcome to Heartbreak\" stood as the first ever collaboration between the two, though they later collaborated on numerous other tracks, including Kid Cudi's \"Erase Me\" and West's \"Gorgeous\". They went on to form a duo under the name of Kids See Ghosts, releasing their eponymous debut studio album on June 8, 2018.\nThough the majority of the album sees West at his most vulnerable, \"Paranoid\" is one of its most joyful songs. The song was recorded during the period of three weeks that West worked on 808s & Heartbreak in 2008. Seeking out a minimalist direction sonically, West directed his team to bring unique drum machines to Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii. They were sampled and reprogrammed into West's Roland TR-808 drum machine at the studio, which recording engineer Anthony Kilhoffer explained was responsible for the song's \"unique sounds\". West had been looking for an electronic sound with the album, which the song includes.\nMusically, \"Paranoid\" is an upbeat new wave song that runs for a duration of four minutes and thirty-seven seconds, and includes an electronic sound throughout. Its instrumentation has synth-pop elements, nodding towards"

The song was Williams's first UK number-one single since \"Radio\" in 2004, and was deliberately produced in the style of other 2012 chart-toppers in a calculated attempt to re-establish his presence in the UK charts.\nThe track premiered on BBC Radio 1 just days before the station removed Williams from their playlist, deeming him no longer relevant to their target audience. Williams claimed to be gutted by the decision, citing Radio 1 as a pop star's \"main oxygen\". When the song reached number one without Radio 1 airplay, the singer thanked the station, who \"have supported me for a long, long time and I'm very grateful to them. Oh, and I can still have number ones without them!\"\nThe track was originally rumoured to be titled \"Vertigo\". Williams said of the track: \"It's a summer song, very much in a similar vein to 'Rock DJ', about a girl who thinks she's great. And she might be, but she's a bit nefarious with her ways. Some songs take an age to write and some songs just fall out of your mouth completely formed, and you don't have to think about it. I don't know why that fell out of my mouth and out of my brain at that particular time \u2013 it just did.\" On 10 September, Williams debuted \"Candy\" on Radio 2's Breakfast Show with host Chris Evans. The official artwork for the track features a model of Williams's head covered in pink and red spots.\n\"Candy\" was written by Robbie Williams, Gary Barlow and Terje Olsen, while production was handled by Jacknife Lee. The song samples Norwegian producer Todd Terje\u2018s single \"Eurodans\". In the hook, he uses nursery rhymes about the plague (Ring a Ring o\u2019 Roses) and taxes. \"Hey ho here she goes/ Either a little too high or a little too low/ Got no self-esteem and vertigo/ Cause she thinks she's made of candy,\" Williams chants on the chorus. The song contains melodic elements of the nursery rhyme Ring a Ring o' Roses and even contains the title of the rhyme at the start of the second verse.\n\nLewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song 4 out of 5 stars, writing that \"'Candy' doesn't touch the dizzying heights of 'Rock DJ' or 'Angels', but it's also far from his worst song to date.\" Corner also wrote: \"Robbie chants on a bouncy, playground chant of a chorus brassier than his stage persona \u2013 and there within lies the charm.\" John Bush of AllMusic wrote that \"The trailer single 'Candy' is a trite, uptempo track with a sing-song chorus but not much of a shelf life, it's the perfect radio hit.\" Sam Lanksy of Idolator wrote the song \"is sprightly and spunky with a clever hook \u2014 arguably the best sweets-related diss since Annie's 'Chewing Gum'.\" Tom Hocknell of BBC Music called it \"catchier than Velcro, although it\u2019s unclear why anyone needs to own it \u2013 after the second listen it owns you. It\u2019s eager to please, certainly.\"\nAlexis Petridis of The Guardian was less positive, writing that \"[...] It's so desperate to be a smash hit that it ends up sounding like one of those novelty singles that used to blight the September charts, bought by returning holidaymakers with rosy memories of the hotel disco; all it's lacking is an accompanying dance.\" Philip Matusavage of musicOMH also gave the song a mixed review, writing that \"It's a neat pr\u00e9cis of the problems facing Robbie in 2012. Its bouncy dancehall brass is undeniably and infectiously catchy but it\u2019s also short-lived; the song leaves no impression at its end.\" Kitty Empire of The Observer observed that \"it would better suit a boy band in a Caribbean time warp. But somehow, it looks as if it will re-establish Williams's presence in the charts today, regardless.\"\nIn Germany, \"Candy\" broke an airplay record for the most plays in a week. It peaked at number 3 on the main chart. In Austria, the song was a success, debuting and peaking, for three consecutive weeks, at number 4 on the \u00d63 Austria Top 40 chart. \"Candy\" was a growing success in the Netherlands, debuting at number 27 on the Dutch Top 40 chart. After six weeks climbing the charts, the song entered the top-ten, reaching number 6, on 10 November 2012. In the Dutch Mega Top 100 \"Candy\" reached number 1 on 17 November 2012. It reached top 10 in more than 20 countries, and Top 40 in other territories including Japan and New Zealand.\nIn his native UK, despite BBC Radio 1 not putting it on their playlist, \"Candy\" gathered over 10,000"

It was written by Tinashe, Bebe Rexha, Stargate, and Cashmere Cat, and produced by the latter two. A crunk&B song, \"All Hands on Deck\" contains a prominent pan flute breakdown, a thick bassline and \"club-friendly\" beat, and has been described as the \"sister song\" to the album's lead single \"2 On\" (2014). The track's lyrical content comprises a dance instructional and portrays a scenario of retaining confidence, and rebound dating after a break-up, and contain themes of girl power and self empowerment. On February 22, 2015, a remix version of the song premiered online featuring Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, and received a digital-only release on February 24. Serving as the third single from Aquarius, it impacted urban contemporary radio and was released as a digital download in the United States on February 24, 2015.\nThe song garnered positive reviews from music critics who commended its club appeal and Tinashe's vocals, while also naming it as a highlight on the album. Azalea's verse on the promotional remix version was also well-received, with critics opining that her addition was beneficial for the track's airplay prospects. Tinashe has performed \"All Hands on Deck\" for radio stations KPWR and Nova 106.9, and as part of her set list for her Aquarius Tour (2014\u201315).\n\"All Hands on Deck\" was written by Tinashe, Bebe Rexha, Stargate and Cashmere Cat, and produced by the latter two. Stargate and Cashmere Cat were also responsible for the track's instrumentation and programming, while the former recorded the song with Tinashe at DownTown Studios in New York City. \"All Hands on Deck\" was then mixed by Phil Tan at the Ninja Club in Atlanta, Georgia, and mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace, New York City. Other personnel involved included Tim Blacksmith and Danny D. as executive producers, and Daniela Rivera as an assistant engineer. The song's title was first revealed in the announcement of the Aquarius track listing on August 27, 2014. Tinashe then uploaded the original version of \"All Hands on Deck\" to her SoundCloud page along with the rest of the album on September 30, 2014. Rexha announced the song's single release on January 23, 2015, on Snapchat. On February 9, 2015, Tinashe announced that the single's release will be accompanied by a new version of the song which will contain a new verse from a guest feature. In an interview with WZMX, she stated, \"I wanted to put out something that's a little fresh, because the song has been on the album for a few months, so I wanted to give somebody a brand new verse, a little something-something\".\nOn February 21, 2015, Tinashe posted the single's cover art on her Instagram account. A remix version of \"All Hands on Deck\" was premiered by Perez Hilton on February 22, 2015, featuring Australian rapper Iggy Azalea rapping the song's new verse. The official remix was released as a promotional single for The Great Escape Tour, that both Azalea and Tinashe were scheduled to be a part of during the Spring 2015. It received its radio premiere on WZMX on February 23, 2015. Serving as the third single from Aquarius, it impacted urban contemporary radio and was released as a digital download in the United States on February 24, 2015. \"All Hands on Deck\" was commercially released in the United Kingdom on April 19, 2015. Another remix featuring DeJ Loaf was released on June 8, 2015.\n\"All Hands on Deck\" is a crunk&B song which contains elements of West Coast hip hop, grime and late 1990s-early 2000s R&B. It comprises a thick bassline, \"club-friendly\" beat, thudding synthesizers and a pan flute breakdown. Noted to be a shift from more sweet and coy-sounding tracks on Aquarius, Tinashe solicits a snarling technique in her vocal delivery, together with a more upbeat attitude and in contrast with Azalea's braggadocio. On the promotional remix single, Azalea's rapped verse occurs halfway through the song's duration, at its bridge, with the rapper announcing herself as \"Iggs\". Described as the \"sister song\" to Aquarius lead single \"2 On\", \"All Hands on Deck\" also garnered comparisons to Cassie's \"Long Way 2 Go\""

Sasha Fierce (2008). The track was released as the eighth single from the album on September 22, 2009. A remixed version featuring Lady Gaga was released on November 17, 2009. Musically, the song consists of simple lyrics and hidden innuendos, with Gaga and Beyonc\u00e9 trading verses with each other in the song's remix. The lyrics refer to putting up a sexy display to be recorded on a video phone.\nThe song received generally mixed reviews from most music critics. Some noted that Gaga's featured appearance in the song's remix failed to add anything to the tune. The original version charted in the lower regions of the charts of Australia and its urban music chart, Spain, the United Kingdom and on the R&B charts in the United States. The remixed version charted at number sixty-five on the US Billboard Hot 100, and topped the Dance Club Songs chart in the country. The remix also charted in Australia and its urban music chart, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand, while it bubbled under the main music charts of Belgium.\nA music video was created to accompany the remix featuring Gaga. It portrayed her and Knowles in a number of costumes, brandishing colorful guns towards men and paying homage to the film Reservoir Dogs (1992) and pin-up legend Bettie Page. It received mixed feedback from critics, who called it un-interesting, and felt that it did not present anything new. However, they complimented the costumes and the cinematic homage of the video. In the United States, the video went on to win the BET award for Video of the Year.\n\"Video Phone\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Shondrae Crawford, Sean Garrett and Lady Gaga in the remixed version. It was produced by Bangladesh, The Pen and Knowles. Initially, \"Video Phone\" was sent to US urban contemporary radios on September 22, 2009. The release was later recalled and in October 2009, Life & Style reported that Knowles and pop singer Lady Gaga were collaborating for a remixed version of the song. The remixed version featured both Knowles and Lady Gaga trading verses with one another. The remixed version of the song that features Lady Gaga was included on the 2009 deluxe edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce.\nMusically, \"Video Phone\" is a crunk song. According to the sheet music published at Sheetmusicplus.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate groove tempo of 120 beats per minute and in the key of Eb minor. It consists of simple lyrics, with hidden innuendos, and is backed by thin-spread beats; Knowles and Gaga uttering gasps and groans while singing the song. Chris Willman from Yahoo! said that the lyrics are a \"celebration of Skype sex and putting on a solo show, on camera, for a guy you just met at the club.\"\nThe female protagonist sings how she will dance for a man, while he is filming her with his videophone, this being illustrated in the line, \"Press 'record' and I'll let you film me\", and \"You want me naked? If you like this position you can tape it\". According to James Reed of The Boston Globe the lines \"What? You want me naked/ If you likin' this position, you can tape it\" are sung with an accent which was \"part Long Island, part Barbados\". Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club commented that \"Video Phone\" is very similar to Missy Elliott's songs. Rolling Stone's Christian Hoard and The Washington Post's J. Freedom du Lac found similarities between \"Video Phone\" and the songs by rock band Nine Inch Nails. San Francisco Chronicle's Aidin Vaziri noted that the song sounded like it was swiped from Bj\u00f6rk.\nThe song received mixed reviews.  Alexis Petridis from The Guardian compared the song to \"Diva\", stating that \"Video Phone\" is \"Almost equally weird, but much better, [and it] introduces us to the unlikely figure of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, amateur pornographer: 'You want me naked? If you like this position you can tape it.' She"

Written by Ciara and Missy Elliott and produced by Jazze Pha, it was released as the album's second single on November 1, 2004, in the United States. It peaked within the top 10 of the charts in several countries worldwide, including Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song is heavily inspired by 1980s electro music production. Throughout the song, Ciara gives a description of how the song's beat feels as she exhorts party-goers to dance to the music. \"1, 2 Step\" was ranked 59th on Billboard's Top 100 Songs of the 2000s. In the United States, the song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for seven weeks.\nThe song also features Missy Elliott using an interpolation verse from Teena Marie's song \"Square Biz\".\n\"1, 2 Step\" is one of four songs Ciara and Jazze Pha originally recorded at Doppler Studios in Atlanta two years before the release of Goodies. It is explained that Ciara was inspired by Roscoe Blunt, leading to the creation of this song. \"The two connected so well, that half of the album was made within eight days or so.\" Pha asked Missy Elliott to appear on the track and she accepted. Elliott recorded her rap verse at the Hit Factory Criteria in Miami.\n\"1, 2 Step\" is a Crunk&B track, which is strongly influenced by 1980s electro music. The song was created on one of Jazze Pha's five Akai MPC3000s. Pha used laser pulses from E-mu Proteus in the 2000s that were used for old school hip hop songs and b-boy break dance tracks. \"1, 2 Step\" is inspired by Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock.\" Jazze Pha thought about how he could create a more melodic version and \"shared some interesting ideas on what kind of music he would like to produce with her. Let's put it this way, it would be epic.\" \"1, 2 Step\" references her past song \"Goodies\" and \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen.\n\"1, 2 Step\" received favorable reviews from music critics. Contact Music gave the song three out of five stars and called it \"arse shaking floor filling R&B\" and a \"wicked melodic souful twist.\" Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic was published that the track is \"good, if not great.\" Gerardo E. wrote it's \"a feel good track,\" something that is not overproduced but works its magic.\" Kate Watkins of The Situation called it \"a funky song in the style we have come to expect from Missy.\" Fazed stated that the song is about \"joys of dancing around with family.\" Slant thought that \"1, 2 Step\" was a \"fun dance track.\"\n\"1, 2 Step\" was nominated for the 2006 Grammy Award for \"Best Rap/Sung Collaboration,\" but lost to \"Numb/Encore\" by Jay-Z and Linkin Park. The song also received a nomination at the Soul Train Lady of Soul Music Awards for \"Best Dance Cut.\" The song was nominated for \"Viewer's Choice\" at the 2005 BET Awards, but lost to Omarion's \"O.\" The song won the award \"Best Performed Songs in the ASCAP Repertory for the 2005 Survey Year,\" which included the title track from the album as well as third single, \"Oh.\" The song won the award for \"Choice Music R&B/Hip Hop Track\" at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards and \"Best Collaboration\" and \"Viewer's Choice\" at the BET Awards in 2005.\n\"1, 2 Step\" debuted at number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the January 8, 2005, issue of Billboard, the song climbed to number two on the chart and stayed there for seven weeks, while being held from the top slot by Mario's \"Let Me Love You\" and became Ciara's second top-10 single. \"1, 2 Step\" reached number one on the Billboard Pop 100 (the first on the then new chart), Hot Dance Airplay, Hot Digital Tracks, and Top 40 Mainstream charts. It also peaked in the top five on the Hot Digital Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Rhythmic Airplay and the Top 40 Tracks charts, and the top 30 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. \"1, 2 Step\" was ranked at number five for the year on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2005. The single was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over three million digital copies in the United States.\nInternationally, \"1, 2 Step\" was successful, reaching the top 10 in several countries.

It was released as the third single of the record on 22 April 2016 by Parlophone. Background vocals in the song are provided by Beyonc\u00e9, Annabelle Wallis and Merry Clayton. A music video for the track, directed by Vania Heymann and Gal Muggia, was released on 16 May 2016.\nThe song contains a chorus choir, which featured nearly all the artists who have collaborated with the group, including Beyonc\u00e9, Brian Eno and the children and guests of the four musicians. Guitarist and singer Noel Gallagher also contributed, performing the song's second guitar solo, which was omitted in the radio edit.\nThe band had released teasers on their social media accounts leading up to the video release. The music video directed by Vania Heymann and Gal Muggia was released on 16 May 2016. It has been described on the band's website as a \"poignant, surrealist montage which alludes to contemporary issues.\" The video itself consists of over-layered visuals, and has the band playing the song in various landscapes and locations. One of the locations used is the Croatian mountain range of Biokovo, upon which Chris Martin appears to be seated.\nScenes and visual effects for the video were created by GloriaFX, a Ukraine-based visual effects company, headed by Anatolii Kuzmytskyi in Ukraine and by Max Colt in the US. Martin called it \"one of the best videos ever made\". Some scenes were cut from the video to make it shorter, including a man with a volcano in place of his head.\nThe band's lead singer, Chris Martin feels that this was one of best videos to be made. He says ''The video is \u2013 I'm going to drop the mic here and say \u2013 I think it's one of the best videos people have made. Even if you take the music away. That's my point,\" Coldplay's lead singer Chris Martin said. \"It's made by these Israeli guys. These young guys. I can't believe that that's our video. If that was someone else's video, I'd be so jealous.\"\nBillboard magazine's Chris Payne described the music video as \"appropriately epic\" with \"a heady, shoot-for-the-stars type of statement\". Carl Williott of Idolator, who was reserved towards the song itself, felt that its video \"elevates it thanks to some artfully trippy visuals\". MTV UK called the video \"weird and wonderful in every respect\" and \"magical yet poignant\".\nThe video received nominations for Best Direction and Best Visual Effects at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, winning the latter. The music video was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\nAfter giving fans a live performance preview of the album on 21 November 2015 in Los Angeles, Martin said: \"This is kind of the song we've been waiting to write for 15 years.\" The band performed the song at the Super Bowl 50 halftime show held on 7 February 2016 in Santa Clara, California. They were joined by Bruno Mars and Beyonc\u00e9 while singing the last verses. During the performance at Glastonbury Festival on 26 June 2016, the band were joined on stage by Chris Martin's children, Apple and Moses, who helped with the backing vocals.\nThe song was used to close the A Head Full of Dreams Tour. The live performance on 15 November 2017 in La Plata, Buenos Aires with an extended outro is included in Live in Buenos Aires.  Live recordings of the song have been released with the Butterfly Package as well as the Japanese exclusive live album \u2018Love In Tokyo\u2019 released in 2018.\n\nCredits are adapted from A Head Full of Dreams liner notes.\nColdplay\nGuy Berryman\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar, keyboards\nJonny Buckland\u00a0\u2013 guitar, keyboards\nWill Champion\u00a0\u2013 drums, backing vocals, programming\nChris Martin\u00a0\u2013 lead vocals, piano, acoustic guitar\nAdditional musicians\nMerry Clayton\u00a0\u2013 vocals\nBeyonc\u00e9 Knowles\u00a0\u2013 vocals\nAnnabelle Wallis\u00a0\u2013 vocals\nNoel Gallagher\u00a0\u2013 guitar solo\nMoses Martin\u00a0\u2013 tambourine\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Up&Up (Radio Edit)\".\n\"BBC \u2013 Radio 1 \u2013 Playlist\".

It was written and produced by Chantal Kreviazuk, Raine Maida and Kara DioGuardi, with additional writing from Clarkson. The song talks about a relationship that is not working out and she wants a lover who will support her, not disappear when she needs him the most.\nIt was released as the album's fourth single. The song received generally positive reviews from most music critics, who commended Clarkson's attitude on the song. In March 2006, the single was certified gold by RIAA and has sold over 500,000 copies in all formats in the United States. As of February 2010, \"Walk Away\" has sold over 1.1 million digital copies in the U.S.\nClarkson called \"Walk Away\" \"one of the brighter songs\" on Breakaway, and said that \"It's just one of those anthem songs where everybody is [bouncing their heads] in the car.\" She said of its subject matter, \"the whole song is just about if it's not working out, then just leave, don't stay and make it worse.\" After spawning 4 major top 10 singles (\"Breakaway,\" \"Since U Been Gone,\" \"Behind These Hazel Eyes,\" and \"Because of You\") and spending 60 weeks in the top 20 of the Billboard albums chart, Clarkson released \"Walk Away\" as the fifth single.\n\"Walk Away\" was written by Clarkson, Chantal Kreviazuk, Raine Maida and Kara DioGuardi and produced by Maida, DioGuardi and Kreviazuk.  It is one of 5 collaborations with Kara DioGuardi from the album and the first to be released as a single. DioGuardi had become one of the most sought songwriter/producers after playing key roles on hits from Ashlee Simpson's \"Pieces of Me\" to Lindsay Lohan's \"Confessions of a Broken Heart.\" For additional insurance Canadian couple Chantal Kreviazuk and Raine Maida, frequent Avril Lavigne collaborators, assisted on \"Walk Away.\"\nTense guitars open the song, setting a cross tone. In \"Walk Away,\" Clarkson's relationship with her boyfriend seemed to be sunk at the start. With his family conspiring against them and aiding in his deceptions, there was no way it was going to work. Clarkson's hurt not only stems from his indifference to her, but his family's animosity towards her. \"You've got your mother and your brother/ Every other undercover/ Tellin' you what to say/\", she sings. In the chorus, he asks her whether or not they should continue dating: \"I'm looking for attention/ Not another question/ Should you stay or should you go?/ Well, if you don't have the answer/ Why you still standin' here?/ Hey, hey, hey, hey/Just walk away.\" In the second verse, she says that he stood up her plenty of evenings. However, each time she believed he would be there. After the chorus is the heated bridge. Clarkson says she wants a relationship where the guy loves her as passionately as she does him. She wants a lover who will support her, not disappear when she needs him the most. She asks if he thinks the relationship is worth fighting for. \"I wanna love/ I want a fire/ To feel the burn/ My desires/ I wanna man by my side/ Not a boy who runs and hides/ Are you gonna fight for me?/ Die for me?/ Live and breathe for me?/ Do you care for me?/ 'Cause if you don't then just leave,\" she sings.\n\nPam Avoledo of Blogcritics wrote that \"[...] Clarkson vocals fiery and smoldering. She's come a long way from American Idol where she had the sing songs technically perfect with the emotion optional. However, in the single, she unleashes whatever anger she felt from a past breakup and puts it in the song.\"\nStephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called it \"driving, anthemic pop tune\" and picked it as one of the album's best tracks. Robert Christgau named it a \"prefab kissoff\". Charles Merwin from Stylus Magazine wrote that \"Luckily, songs like 'Breakaway' and 'Walk Away' are good enough to make you forget about some disappointments on the album.\" On March 5, 2013, Billboard ranked the song at number 20 in its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time.\n\"Walk Away\" debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at number 97 on the chart dated January 21, 2006. \"Walk Away\" became Breakaway's first release to fail to achieve top 10 status on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 12.  In the United Kingdom, the song debuted and peaked at number 21. In Australia, on the ARIA Charts, the song debuted at number 29. Later, it reached number 28, before falling to number 33.

The song, written by Matthew Gerrard, Bridget Benenate and Avril Lavigne, was originally intended for Lavigne's debut studio album, Let Go (2002). After being deemed unsuitable for the album, it was passed to Clarkson to be recorded as a soundtrack for the film The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. Clarkson, who was finishing her second studio album at that time, recorded \"Breakaway\" to tide her fans over until the first single from her new album was released. However, the song's success prompted its inclusion on Clarkson's second album where she decided to name the album after the song. \"Breakaway\" was first released by Walt Disney Records as the first single from The Princess Diaries 2 soundtrack on July 19, 2004. In May 2006, \"Breakaway\" was reissued as the fifth and final single from the album of the same name.\n\"Breakaway\" received positive reviews from music critics, who could relate to the song's message and simple lyrics. It incorporates acoustic guitars and airy drums which are interspersed with Clarkson's controlled voice. The lyrics narrate Clarkson's journey as a girl growing up in a small town who follows her dream for self-improvement. \"Breakaway\" was a commercial success outside of the United States, where it peaked within the top 20 of multiple European countries, and in the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Hungary and the Netherlands. In the US, the song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became her third top ten song in the chart. It also topped the US Adult Contemporary for twenty-one non-consecutive weeks, a record for female artists that is now shared between herself, Celine Dion's \"A New Day Has Come\" and Adele's \"Hello\".\nDirected by Dave Meyers, the accompanying music video for \"Breakaway\" portrays Clarkson as a young girl from a small town who follows her dream and becomes an international star. It also contained scenes interspersed from The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. Clarkson acted out most of the lyrics in the music video because she felt that the song was autobiographical. Critics responded positively to the music video for being faithful to the central theme shared by the song, the film, and Clarkson's personal biography. Clarkson performed the song in a series of live appearances such as television shows Saturday Night Live, The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. She has performed the song in her concert tours, including the Stronger Tour. \"Breakaway\" has also been covered by many contestants from reality television singing competitions, notably Katie Stevens, a contestant in the ninth season of American Idol, as well as an English pop duo, Belle Amie who finished eleventh in the seventh season of The X Factor. It was also used in Brazilian soap operas Malha\u00e7\u00e3o and Amigas & Rivais.\n\"Breakaway\" was originally written by Avril Lavigne, Bridget Benenate and Matthew Gerrard. According to Benenate, the song was written in 2001 when she was working with Gerrard for Lavigne's first album, Let Go. Benenate explained that Lavigne came to her to write the song, saying\nAvril talked about her life and what things were important to her \u2013 she was the inspiration for the song\u00a0:-)\u00a0:-).

I love being in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed.

Benenate also added that it was Mitchell Leib, the President of Music and Soundtracks for Walt Disney Pictures and Television/Buena Vista Music Group, who secured \"Breakaway\" as one of the soundtracks of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement.

The song was released by RCA Records on June 5, 2012 as the third and final single from Clarkson's fifth studio album, Stronger (2011). \"Dark Side\" is a mid-tempo synth-pop ballad that incorporates a vigorous music box melody with up-tempo beats in choruses, with its lyrics containing the theme of acceptance, recovery, and inner-beauty.\n\"Dark Side\" has received generally positive reviews from music critics who considered the song as a good successor to \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\", Clarkson's previous single. Critics also praised Clarkson's vocal performance blending with the song's melody. It became her second consecutive song to top the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Shane Drake, who also directed \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" and premiered on May 24, 2012 with positive reviews. It was nominated for a MTV Video Music Award for Best Video with a Message at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. Clarkson has performed \"Dark Side\" during several live appearances, most notably during the 2012 Billboard Music Awards and included the song as the opening performance in the set list during the North American leg of her Stronger Tour.\n\"Dark Side\" was written by songwriters busbee & Alexander Geringas, and produced by Greg Kurstin. In an interview with Popjustice, Clarkson revealed that she had always desired to collaborate with Kurstin since finishing recording tracks for her sophomore album Breakaway in 2004. Jeff Aldrich, RCA Records' A&R executive, managed to get Kurstin to produce tracks for Clarkson's fifth studio album in 2010. Kursin took time to hear Clarkson's previous records before their recording sessions began, in which Clarkson felt made the recording \"easier.\"\nIn July 2011, several of Clarkson's demos were leaked on the internet, including a demo of \"Dark Side\". The final version of the song then surfaced online a week prior to the album's release, although it was quickly removed by RCA Records and the IFPI. Clarkson subsequently published the song online to prevent the leaks. In an interview with New York radio Z100, Clarkson revealed that she was considering \"Dark Side\" to be released as the third single from Stronger: \"I like \"Dark Side\" because it\u2019s still got a beat to it, It\u2019s a sweet-sounding song but with a dark lyric, and I like that.\" During the Canadian leg of her Stronger Tour, Clarkson confirmed to MTV News Canada that \"Dark Side\" will be released as the third single from the album. The song was already receiving early radio airplay in Sydney, Australia from November 2011, on the pop/rock show, 'Juice'.\n\"Dark Side\" is a midtempo synth-pop ballad. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com, \"Dark Side\" is written in the key of D major with a moderate tempo of 119 beats per minute.  It follows a chord progression of D-D\u2212G\u2212Em7b5/G, and Kelly's vocals span from D\u2084 to F\u266f\u2085.\nChris Willman of The Wrap remarked, \"\"Dark Side\" cleverly reinforces the idea that Miss American Idol has a shadow side with a spooky music-box melody that cuts in every time the big beat and goth histrionics briefly cut out.\" James Dinh of MTV News described the song as \"On \"Dark Side,\" Kelly ventures away from her sometimes predictable scorned woman stomping grounds and closer toward her vulnerable side as she questions whether her lover will stick around even through the bad times.\" Entertainment Weekly also included the song in their \"Songs for the Lovers (and Haters)\" playlist article, remarking, \"(Clarkson's) soaring synth-pop ballad defines what love's all about: knowing your girlfriend's a little bit crazy, and still not running away.\"\nJoey Guerra of Houston Chronicle noted that \"Dark Side recalls Clarkson's under-appreciated My December disc, a swirl of lullaby strains and goth-pop grooves. Think Katy Perry with a much, much better voice.\" Jason Scott of Seattle Post-Intelligencer remarked, \"\"Dark Side,\" takes Stronger and banks a hard left. With a xylophone tinkling out a lullaby-like intro, Clarkson takes a creative adventure into extraterrestrial territory that is an oddly soothing and intriguing fit for her voice.

Collins sings backgrounds and plays drums on the track. Written by Roxanne Seeman and Billie Hughes, it is an ode to the mystical and mercurial nature of life and love, inspired by Dream of the Red Chamber (Chinese: \u7d05\u6a13\u5922; pinyin: H\u00f3ngl\u00f3um\u00e8ng), Chinese philosophy and the I Ching.\nThe recording sessions took place at The Townhouse recording studio in London, Ocean Way Recording and The Complex in Los Angeles, with George Massenburg engineering and mixing.\n\"Walking on the Chinese Wall\" was released May 1985 by Columbia Records as the third single, peaking at number 46 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song received significant airplay internationally, charting in European territories, Australia and New Zealand.  \nA music video with Bailey in the Chinese countryside and a Chinese sage contemplating and throwing the I Ching coins, also went into heavy rotation.\nBailey received a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male, for his performance on the Chinese Wall album, at the 28th Annual Grammy Awards,1986.\nConcurrent with the September 28, 2018 launch of Phil Collins' \"Not Dead Yet Tour\" Collins' released Plays Well With Others, a box set featuring tracks recorded by artists he collaborated with including Robert Plant, Eric Clapton, Quincy Jones, Tony Bennett, Paul McCartney, and Philip Bailey, among others, with Walking on the Chinese Wall appearing as track 4, disc 2.\nIn 1998, Sony Germany released a Philip Bailey compilation album entitled \"Walking on the Chinese Wall.\"\nIn 1982, after having studied Chinese arts and literature at Columbia University, Seeman went on a tour of China, where she walked on the Northern Juyongguan Gate of the Great Wall outside of Beijing. She returned to Los Angeles where she met Billie Hughes, a recording artist who had been writing songs for his own albums, and they began writing songs together. In 1983, Hughes went to Japan for four months, performing in a club in Osaka.\nUpon Hughes' return, they began a partnership and bought recording equipment. The first song Hughes composed on the Oberheim OB-8 synthesizer and DMX drum machine was inspired with a feeling of the East. For the lyrics, Hughes asked Seeman to \"write me something Chinese\".\nSeeman, who had written \"Sailaway\" with Philip Bailey for Earth, Wind & Fire's \"Faces\" album, called Bailey in Denver, Colorado, to tell him about the song before flying with Hughes to New York.\nOne year before, while in London with Earth, Wind & Fire on a European tour, Bailey had met Phil Collins and talked about the possibility of working together.\nBailey asked Seeman and Hughes to meet him with a chord chart at JFK airport, where he would be changing planes on his way to London to record with Phil Collins at The Townhouse. At the airport, Hughes gave Bailey the chord chart, written out with a gold-ink pen, and Seeman gave Bailey a cassette of the song, along with the Sony Walkman it was in.\nAsked about how the album got its name, Bailey explained:\nI was about to fly from LA to London to record the album when I got a call from Roxanne Seeman in New York (...). She said she had a song she wanted me to hear. I had a stopover in New York, so Roxanne came out to the airport and played the song for me on her Walkman.  The minute I heard it, I knew I wanted it (\u2026). I guess this is one case where China got some good out of a Japanese invention.\n\u2014\u2009Philip Bailey\nIn writing the lyrics, Seeman drew from her studies, making symbolic references to literature, art and philosophy in Chinese culture.\nThe song opens with Bailey singing \"Butterfly spread your painted wings for an answer from the Ching\" referencing Taoism and the \"The Butterfly Dream\" passage from the Zhuangzi.\nThe following verse \"By the stream, stretching on the rocks, tiger on the mountaintop\" creates a yin and yang visual of mountains and water, and of the majestic tiger, symbolic of power, luck, and protection, leading the way into the chorus.\nSeeman spent several months writing the lyrics. While reflecting on her China travels, she came up with the title and hookline \"Walking on the Chinese Wall\".\nThe second"

Written by George Harrison, it was the last new track recorded by the band before their break-up in April 1970. The song originated from their January 1969 rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios when they were considering making a return to live performance. Written at a time of acrimony within the group, the lyrics lament humankind's propensity for self-centredness and serve as a comment on the discord that led to Harrison temporarily leaving the Beatles. The musical arrangement alternates between waltz-time verses and choruses played in the hard rock style.\nThe song reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and their denouncement of ego in favour of universal consciousness. When Harrison presented \"I Me Mine\" at Twickenham, John Lennon showed little interest and instead waltzed with Yoko Ono while the other Beatles rehearsed the song. Footage of the couple dancing was included in the Let It Be documentary film. In January 1970, by which point Lennon had privately left the group, the three remaining members formally recorded the song at EMI Studios in London for the Let It Be album. When preparing the album for release, producer Phil Spector extended the track by repeating the chorus and second verse, in addition to adding orchestration and a female choir.\nAmong music critics, several writers have identified \"I Me Mine\" as a powerful final performance by the Beatles and an apt statement from Harrison. The song has been referenced by some religious scholars in their commentary on egoism. Harrison titled his 1980 autobiography I, Me, Mine after the track. The original recording, lasting just 1:34, appeared on the Beatles' 1996 outtakes compilation Anthology 3, introduced by a mock announcement from Harrison referring to Lennon's departure.\nGeorge Harrison wrote \"I Me Mine\" on 7 January 1969, during the second week of the Beatles' filmed rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios in west London. The film project \u2013 which became known as Get Back and eventually Let It Be \u2013 formed part of the Beatles' proposed return to live performance for the first time since 1966. Harrison recalled that after spending two months in the United States in late 1968, he was \"quite optimistic\" about the new project, but the situation within the group \"was just the same as it had been when we were last in the studio ... There was a lot of trivia and games being played.\" For Harrison, the power struggle between John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and the constant presence of Lennon's girlfriend, avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, created an atmosphere that contrasted sharply with the creative freedom and camaraderie he had recently enjoyed with Bob Dylan and the Band in upstate New York.\nWhen writing the song, Harrison drew inspiration from the divisive atmosphere in the band. The 7 January rehearsal was marked by acrimony, as the Beatles argued over the direction of the project. Hours were given over to rehearsing McCartney's \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" with little improvement, and McCartney confronted Lennon over his lack of new songs, drawing a sarcastic response from Lennon. Since the start of the project, Harrison had presented several new songs for consideration, only to see them given laborious treatment by the band or overlooked entirely. That day, he confronted his bandmates about their attitude to his songs; he later complained that due to their greater experience as songwriters, Lennon and McCartney viewed their own material as the priority and \"I'd have to wait through ten of their songs before they'd even listen to one of mine.\" In their study of the tapes from the Get Back project, authors Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that Lennon and McCartney regularly overlooked Harrison's compositions, even when his songs were \"far better than their own\".\nWhen discussing \"I Me Mine\", Harrison said he was addressing the \"eternal problem\" of egoism and that his perspective was informed by his past experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD. He said the concept was in keeping with Swami Vivekananda's teaching that an individual's goal in life was to realise their divine qualities by transcending ego concerns, which Harrison called \"the little 'i'\", and seeing themselves as part of \"the big 'I'; i.e. OM, the complete whole, universal consciousness that is devoid of duality and ego\". Author Jonathan Gould describes the song as a \"commentary on the selfishness\" of Lennon and McCartney, while musicologist Walter Everett says that after Harrison had written"

Collins sings backgrounds and plays drums on the track. Written by Roxanne Seeman and Billie Hughes, it is an ode to the mystical and mercurial nature of life and love, inspired by Dream of the Red Chamber (Chinese: \u7d05\u6a13\u5922; pinyin: H\u00f3ngl\u00f3um\u00e8ng), Chinese philosophy and the I Ching.\nThe recording sessions took place at The Townhouse recording studio in London, Ocean Way Recording and The Complex in Los Angeles, with George Massenburg engineering and mixing.\n\"Walking on the Chinese Wall\" was released May 1985 by Columbia Records as the third single, peaking at number 46 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song received significant airplay internationally, charting in European territories, Australia and New Zealand.  \nA music video with Bailey in the Chinese countryside and a Chinese sage contemplating and throwing the I Ching coins, also went into heavy rotation.\nBailey received a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male, for his performance on the Chinese Wall album, at the 28th Annual Grammy Awards,1986.\nConcurrent with the September 28, 2018 launch of Phil Collins' \"Not Dead Yet Tour\" Collins' released Plays Well With Others, a box set featuring tracks recorded by artists he collaborated with including Robert Plant, Eric Clapton, Quincy Jones, Tony Bennett, Paul McCartney, and Philip Bailey, among others, with Walking on the Chinese Wall appearing as track 4, disc 2.\nIn 1998, Sony Germany released a Philip Bailey compilation album entitled \"Walking on the Chinese Wall.\"\nIn 1982, after having studied Chinese arts and literature at Columbia University, Seeman went on a tour of China, where she walked on the Northern Juyongguan Gate of the Great Wall outside of Beijing. She returned to Los Angeles where she met Billie Hughes, a recording artist who had been writing songs for his own albums, and they began writing songs together. In 1983, Hughes went to Japan for four months, performing in a club in Osaka.\nUpon Hughes' return, they began a partnership and bought recording equipment. The first song Hughes composed on the Oberheim OB-8 synthesizer and DMX drum machine was inspired with a feeling of the East. For the lyrics, Hughes asked Seeman to \"write me something Chinese\".\nSeeman, who had written \"Sailaway\" with Philip Bailey for Earth, Wind & Fire's \"Faces\" album, called Bailey in Denver, Colorado, to tell him about the song before flying with Hughes to New York.\nOne year before, while in London with Earth, Wind & Fire on a European tour, Bailey had met Phil Collins and talked about the possibility of working together.\nBailey asked Seeman and Hughes to meet him with a chord chart at JFK airport, where he would be changing planes on his way to London to record with Phil Collins at The Townhouse. At the airport, Hughes gave Bailey the chord chart, written out with a gold-ink pen, and Seeman gave Bailey a cassette of the song, along with the Sony Walkman it was in.\nAsked about how the album got its name, Bailey explained:\nI was about to fly from LA to London to record the album when I got a call from Roxanne Seeman in New York (...). She said she had a song she wanted me to hear. I had a stopover in New York, so Roxanne came out to the airport and played the song for me on her Walkman.  The minute I heard it, I knew I wanted it (\u2026). I guess this is one case where China got some good out of a Japanese invention.\n\u2014\u2009Philip Bailey\nIn writing the lyrics, Seeman drew from her studies, making symbolic references to literature, art and philosophy in Chinese culture.\nThe song opens with Bailey singing \"Butterfly spread your painted wings for an answer from the Ching\" referencing Taoism and the \"The Butterfly Dream\" passage from the Zhuangzi.\nThe following verse \"By the stream, stretching on the rocks, tiger on the mountaintop\" creates a yin and yang visual of mountains and water, and of the majestic tiger, symbolic of power, luck, and protection, leading the way into the chorus.\nSeeman spent several months writing the lyrics. While reflecting on her China travels, she came up with the title and hookline \"Walking on the Chinese Wall\".\nThe second"

Released through Def Jam Recordings, the song impacted on mainstream radio stations in the US on 8 July 2014, as the fifth single from her debut studio album, The New Classic (2014). It was written by Azalea, Katy Perry, Sarah Hudson, Benny Blanco, and duo Stargate, while the latter also produced the song. Its  lyrics chronicle subjects of revenge and feminism in a failed romantic relationship. An accompanying music video for the song was released on 13 August 2014.\nInitially a track recorded by Katy Perry for her fourth studio album, Prism (2013), it was excluded from Prism track listing, and Perry handed the demo to Azalea for her to complete. \"Black Widow\" has been described as \"channeling the trap\" genre, containing an ominous steel drum rhythm, heavy bass and a sparse beat. The song peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Azalea's third top-five hit, following \"Fancy\" and \"Problem\". The song also became Ora's first top-three hit in the US. It has also reached number four in the UK and number fifteen in Australia.\nIts composition has been the subject of music critics' comparisons to Perry's \"Dark Horse\". Other journalists, praised its beat and Azalea and Ora's vocals. \"Black Widow\" charted due to strong digital sales during the debut week of The New Classic. Accordingly, before becoming a single it achieved peaks of number 91 in the United Kingdom and number 86 in Australia, and appeared on several component charts. Azalea has performed the song live as part of the set list for her first headlining tour, The New Classic Tour (2014). The song is featured on the video game Just Dance 2015.\nIn early 2013, Azalea became friends with American singer Katy Perry through Chris Anokute, an A&R at Azalea's record label Def Jam Recordings. Anokute, who previously was an A&R for Perry at her label Capitol Records, told Azalea that Perry was a fan of her music. When Azalea was nominated at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, Anokute asked Perry if she could promote Azalea's nomination in her category for Artist to Watch. Perry then took to Twitter to rave about Azalea's music, and Azalea later consulted Anokute about a future collaboration with Perry. Shortly afterward, Azalea and Perry begun working together with the latter's frequent collaborator Dr. Luke, but the collaboration proved unsuccessful. Azalea then heard about a song Perry recorded, \"Black Widow\", which was going to be given away to another artist. The song was initially written as a last-minute addition to Perry's fourth studio album, Prism (2013), but the composition finalized only after the album's release. Azalea described the track as \"a legend\" and a \"mysterious record\", before she could finally hear it.\nOn 4 June 2013, Azalea confirmed that British recording artist Rita Ora would feature on her debut studio The New Classic, after previously announcing Ora's feature on 26 December 2012. She stated, \"I had a song in mind, and I need a woman with a big voice to sing the chorus because I can't do it\". Azalea then asked Perry if she could record \"Black Widow\" for her album, which Perry then agreed to. The record, however, was never sent to Azalea and on 1 August 2013, she denied that Ora would be collaborating with her on the album. Azalea then met Perry for the first time, as her supporting act at the iTunes Festival that year. At the festival, Perry approached Azalea with an offer to record \"Black Widow\" as she felt the song would suit her better. Azalea was then invited to Perry's after party that night, where the two exchanged numbers, and Perry sent Azalea the record. When Azalea received the song, it only consisted of a hook and a beat. She initially wanted Perry to sing the song's hook, but Perry was unable to because of time constraints. In an interview, Azalea mentioned, \"It needed someone who could really sing, as Katy's voice is awesome. The sky's the limit for Rita. Rita's a superstar and she will only get bigger. Rita is a great fit. Her voice can blow people away.\" Azalea and Ora then begun recording \"Black Widow\" in November 2013 after the MTV Europe Music Awards, and completed it in January 2014.\nThe final version of \"Black Widow\" was co-written by Azalea, Perry, Sarah Hudson, Benny Blanco, and its producers StarGate."

Mo Li Hua (Chinese: \u8309\u8389\u82b1; pinyin: M\u00f2l\u00echu\u0101 or M\u00f2lihu\u0101; lit. 'Jasmine Flower') is a popular Chinese folk song from the Jiangnan region. The song dates back to the 18th century. Over time, many regional variations were created, and the song gained popularity both in China and abroad.\nIt has been used during events such as 2004 Summer Olympics, 2008 Summer Olympics and 2010 Shanghai Expo opening ceremony, and during the 2011 Chinese protests.\nIt was created during the Qianlong era (1735\u20131796) of the Qing dynasty. There are several regional versions of the song, with different lyrics and melody.\nOne version of the song describes a custom of giving jasmine flowers, popular in the southern Yangtze delta region of China. Another, longer version describes the fear of plucking the flower. It has been played on ancient metal bells (bianzhong) and modern jade chimes. It uses the five note (pentatonic) scale ubiquitous in Chinese music. The tune is one of xiaodiao (\"short tunes\"), popular in Chinese urban areas. In 1804 a British diplomat, John Barrow, noted that the tune seems to be one of the most popular songs in China.\nThe song became one of the first Chinese folk songs to become widely known outside China. In 1896 the song was used as temporary national anthem by the Qing Chinese officials in Europe. The melody has become well known among Western listeners as it was used by Giacomo Puccini in his opera Turandot (1926), boy choir air \"L\u00e0, sui monti dell'est\", where it is associated with 'Turandot's splendor'. It appeared in a 1937 Hollywood movie The Good Earth (based on a novel by Pearl S. Buck). It has been adapted by many artists around the world, for example by Kenny G. In 1982 the song found a place on a UNESCO list of recommended songs. When China regained sovereignty of Macau and Hong Kong, in 1999 and 1997, respectively, this music was played in the ceremonies. The song was said to be a favorite of China's former leader, Jiang Zemin (it was at his request that the song was played during the transfer ceremony in Hong Kong). The tune was played during Central Committee of the Communist Party of China meetings.\nThis song was sung partially unaccompanied by a young Chinese girl, and partially accompanied by the music by Peking University students (whose version has been described as infused with a techno beat) and broadcast to the world at the closing ceremonies of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, to introduce the next Olympic Games site. An adaptation of the melody by Tan Dun and Wang Hesheng, chosen from more than 4,000 pieces, was played during the medal ceremonies at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. It was also performed at the 2010 Shanghai Expo opening ceremony by an orchestra with the pianist Lang Lang.\nZhao Dongming, head of Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games's culture and ceremonies department, commented that \"This piece of music reminds you of the gold medals for the Beijing Olympics, which are made of gold and jade\". This piece of Tan Dun, an Academy Award winning Chinese contemporary classical composer, cited by China Daily in 2008, described it as \"glorious, heartwarming and full of respect... an iconic piece... almost a cultural symbol of China\" and \"From Puccini to the Beijing Olympics, this melody is a gift from the Chinese people to the world's athletes\". In 2009 Russian singer Vitas, during the Chinese premiere of his program Sleepless Night, at least has also performed Mo Li Hua (never included in digital download until then).\nDuring the 2011 Chinese pro-democracy protests the song became associated with the Jasmine Revolution, as organisers instructed protesters to play Mo Li Hua on their cell phones as a form of antigovernment protest. The song was placed on authorities' list of online censored materials. Videos of the song, including at least one from an official event (a 2006 Kenyan students welcome for Chinese president Hu Jintao), were removed from Chinese websites, and searches for the song's name were blocked. The censorship attracted widespread attention and was difficult because of the popularity of the song and its association with Chinese culture and history. At least one new version of the song, mentioning fear of arrests, has been developed by the activists as a response.\nIn 2013, international superstar Celine Dion performed the song in Mandarin on Chinese state TV as part of its New Year Gala show welcoming in the Lunar New Year. She sang in a duet with Chinese soprano Song Zuying.\nSince 2018, Kazakh singer Dimash Kudaibergen (Qudaibergen) has performed this song in Mandarin on four occasions, three years in a row, during New Year and Chinese New Year celebration galas on various TV stations. Each performance was a new exciting variation, especially the one aired on January 23, 2020 on China Central Television (CCTV, China's state TV station), a groundbreaking duet with"

The next month, it was released in various countries for digital download by Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam and as a CD single through Universal Music, respectively.\nAfter Just Blaze played West multiple beats, \"Touch the Sky\" was the one that he felt most passionate about. It is a hip hop track that includes a slowed sample from the Curtis Mayfield song \"Move On Up\" (1971). The song's lyrics center around West encouraging others to have as much confidence in themselves as he does. It was met with universal acclaim from music critics, with Lupe Fiasco's appearance gathering praise from the majority of them, though some critics were complimentary towards the production. The accompanying music video was released in February 2006 and directed by Chris Milk. Within it, West portrays the daredevil Evel Kanyevel in homage to Evel Knievel's unsuccessful jump across the Snake River Canyon. Evel Knievel sued West over the video in December 2006, though the two ultimately settled the lawsuit in November 2007. The visual received multiple nominations at award shows.\n\"Touch the Sky\" peaked at number 42 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 2006, while reaching the top 10 of the charts in Australia, Scotland and the UK. That same year, the song attained top 20 positions in Finland, Ireland, and New Zealand. It has since been certified platinum in the United States, the UK, and Australia by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), respectively. West performed the song live at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, 2006 Brit Awards and Saturday Night Live. The Milwaukee Brewers use this song for their home runs.\nDuring a July 2014 interview with DJ Skee for SKEE TV, American rapper Lupe Fiasco revealed that he and West didn't meet through Chicago connections even though they both came from the city as West \"was always in a different world.\" Initially, Lupe Fiasco didn't want to feature on \"Touch the Sky\", with him not \"feeling the vibe\" of the song at the time. After being persuaded by his partner telling him \"Nah, you gotta trust me. You gotta do this,\" Lupe Fiasco ultimately agreed on the collaboration and stated of working with West that \"from there on we kind of clicked up and kept it moving up until this day.\" The feature stands as Lupe Fiasco's career debut. American hip hop producer Just Blaze was asked to produce for West during a phone call with Roc-A-Fella Records, with the call leading to him being signed to the label and Just Blaze recalled \"a lot of great music\" being made. Throughout West's production career, comparisons have been made between him and Just Blaze.\nA speed alteration method of sampling was first present within West's music on his debut single \"Through the Wire\" (2003) and this sampling method was used in West's music throughout his career. Just Blaze had been listening to American singer-songwriter Curtis Mayfield at the time of sampling his work. The song was one of the tracks that helped West achieve mainstream success in the United States. When guest-hosting the radio station Beats 1 in December 2015, Just Blaze shared a number of previously unheard records from Roc-A-Fella musicians. An alternative take on \"Touch the Sky\" with American singer Robert Glasper featured was among the records played by him.\nMusically, \"Touch the Sky\" is a hip hop song. A slowed sample is included of Mayfield's 1971 recording \"Move On Up\" within the song, as written by him, alongside Latin horns. Lyrically, the song sees West give encouragement and inspiration to people for them to have a high level of self-confidence like him. A brief history of bright clothes in New York rap is provided by West, dating back to when he first signed to Roc-A-Fella years"

The song was produced by West, while co-produced by Jeff Bhasker. The producers co-wrote it with Esthero, Malik Yusef, and Starshell. West initially shared the song via his blog on September 10, 2008, before re-recording it after negative reactions. The song was later released for digital download on September 18, 2008 by Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam as the lead single from the album. An electropop song, its instrumentation relies on piano and Roland TR-808 drumbeats.\nWest sings through Auto-Tune on the song, with the lyrics looking at a failed relationship's after effects. \"Love Lockdown\" received widely positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented the production. Some directed praise towards the drums in the production, while numerous critics highlighted West's vocal performance on the song. It was named to year-end lists for 2008 by multiple publications, including Pitchfork and Blender. The song won the award of Best Rap/Hip Hop Dance Track at the 2009 International Dance Music Awards. On the US Billboard Hot 100, it became West's highest debut by entering at number three on the chart. The song also reached the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.\n\"Love Lockdown\" has been certified quadruple platinum and gold in the United States and the UK by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI), respectively. An accompanying music video premiered on October 7, 2008. The video replicates the role of Christian Bale in the American film American Psycho (2000), with West making his appearance in his own apartment while all colour has been removed from the rooms. In 2008, Time listed the visual as their Video of the Year.\nWest first performed the song live at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, taking influence from the 2008 Summer Olympics' opening ceremony for the performance. He later performed it on multiple occasions, including at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Hollywood Bowl in 2011 and 2015, respectively. The song was used for Grand Theft Auto's standalone video game compilation, Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City (2009). Cover versions of it were performed by Glass Animals and Lorde in 2014 and 2018, respectively. A remix 12\" vinyl was released in November 2008 for \"Love Lockdown\", which included remixes done by Chew Fu and Jake Trothn, among others.\nAround the time of West's third studio album Graduation being released in September 2007, American record producer Jeff Bhasker started to play keyboards for West's band due to them needing someone to fill in. Originally, Bhasker met West through the rapper's DJ A-Trak and was trying to increase name recognition for himself as a producer by working with West; Bhasker called him \"awesome\". He contributed writing to multiple songs on 808s & Heartbreak, including \"Love Lockdown\", which was co-written by West, Esthero, Malik Yusef, and Starshell. Bhasker recalled that all of the songwriters \"deciphered what\" was being said on the song's demo, shortly after it had been freestyled in full by West. According to Bhasker, the writers helped fill in the words when deciphering West's demo and he admitted collaborators are needed \"that understand songwriting to make the song as good as it can be, even if its not like, 'Okay, let's try this melody or that melody.'\" West produced the song, while co-production was handled by Bhasker. After she accidentally met West in the hallway of a recording studio, Starshell participated in a songwriting session. During the session, the track was written. Starshell later expressed feelings of gladness that she had worked with West, since gathering the experience early in her career helped her understand how the music business works. She explained, stating: \"In this industry, it's about networking and relationships.\"\nInspired by 1980s synthpop icons such as Phil Collins, Gary Numan and Boy George for the material on 808s & Heartbreak, West considered the tracks to be more minimal and functional due to him making usage of the Roland TR-808 drum machine. West stated his"

The song was produced by West, BoogzDaBeast and Xcelence. The producers wrote it alongside Aaron Butts, though the song's sampling of work by Whole Truth led to songwriting credits being listed for Calvin and Curtis Eubanks. It was playlisted to UK mainstream radio by the BBC as the album's lead single on November 8, 2019, through GOOD Music and Def Jam. Around the time of release, the song was the top performing track from Jesus Is King on streaming services. A religious hip hop track, it includes a sample of \"Can You Lose by Following God\" by Whole Truth, which is chopped up in certain sections.\nThe lyrics of \"Follow God\" are about Kanye West's connection with his father, which is in reference to both God and his biological father Ray West, while the meaning of being \"Christlike\" is questioned by him. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics; many named it the best track on Jesus Is King. Critics appreciated the bouncing beat and Whole Truth sample, and complimented West's rapping flow and pace. The song was awarded Top Gospel Song and Rap/Hip Hop Recorded Song of the Year at the Billboard Music Awards and 51st GMA Dove Awards in 2020, respectively.\nCommercially, \"Follow God\" debuted at number 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming West's 18th track to reach the top 10 on the chart. The song also reached the top 10 in nine other countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. It was later certified platinum and silver in the United States and the United Kingdom by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI), respectively. An accompanying music video was screened on November 6, 2019, and released the following day. It shows Kanye and Ray West drive ATVs in snow in Cody, Wyoming. The video concludes with a message from Kanye about his relationship with Ray West. Kanye West performed the song with the Sunday Service Choir as part of his Sunday Service concerts in 2019.\nKanye West produced \"Follow God\" with Xcelence and BoogzDaBeast, the latter of which is one of Jesus Is King's lesser-known producers who contributed to six of its tracks. West previously worked with BoogzDaBeast on the 2018 self-titled debut studio album by Kids See Ghosts, a hip hop duo composed of West and Kid Cudi. The song title was first revealed in a revised track listing of Jesus Is King that West's wife Kim Kardashian shared via Twitter on September 27, 2019. West later previewed the track at a listening party for the album at The Forum in the Los Angeles County on October 23 of that year.\nThe song samples \"Can You Lose By Following God\" (1969) by gospel band Whole Truth, which was featured on archival record label The Numero Group's 2013 compilation album Good God! Apocryphal Hymns. Though the album was not confirmed to be the sample source, West had often sampled music released through the archival record label in the past, including on his tracks \"Bound 2\", \"Facts\", \"Ghost Town\", and \"4th Dimension\". Brothers Calvin and Curtis Eubanks received credit as writers on \"Follow God\" because they contributed backing vocals to \"Can You Lose By Following God\". The song was co-written by West, Aaron Butts, Xcelence and BoogzDaBeast. \"Follow God\" was one of the three tracks that caused the release of Jesus Is King to be delayed due to mixing modifications. West collaborator Consequence explained that the song was important to West due to him being \"up against the ghost of\" his previous tracks such as \"Otis\", \"Good Morning\", \"Champion\" and \"Heard 'Em Say\". According to Consequence, \"Follow God\" had \"to go somewhere new\" and \"be mechanically in tune with the people.\" Consequence said the song \"is a dirty version that got cleaned up,\" which he and West opted for, believing it was an authentic version that \"the people are going to gravitate to\". West cited \"Follow God\" as an example of him creating a track \"that people never heard before.\"\n\"Follow God\" is a hip hop track which features a chopped up sample of Whole Truth's soul recording \"Can You Lose by Following God\". It was compared to West's earlier releases which used samples, and his 2016 song \"Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1\". \"Follow God\" is built around the sample's vocal line, \"Father, I stretch/Stretch my hands to You,\" which begins from the 1:32 mark of the sample. It opens with the sample used as a declaration.\nThe lyrics are about Kanye's"

It was written by Norwegian singer-songwriter Hanne S\u00f8rvaag along with Danish musicians Remee and Thomas Troelsen, the latter of which also handled production on the track. A mid-paced pop song that is built on a ticking clock sample, the song is influenced by elements of Europop and synthpop. Its instrumentation consists essentially of synthesizers and keyboards. Lyrically, it finds the protagonist thinking deeply over her relationship with her love interest from whom she parted; however, she still pines for him and feels self-conscious for doing so.\nA shortened version of the song served as Germany's entry for the 53rd Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Belgrade, having earned tight 50.5% of the audience vote over solo singer Carolin Fortenbacher at the national pre-selection show, Grand Prix Vorentscheid, in March 2008. In the final show of the ESC, on 24 May 2008, the song finished 23rd (out of 25) in the final voting, having earned a total of fourteen points only. Released as a single on 29 February 2008 in German-speaking Europe, the song reached number 4 on the German Singles Chart, where it became the band's biggest-selling single since their reformation in fall 2006. \"Disappear\" also reached the top 30 of the Hungarian Airplay Chart, the top 40 of the \u00d63 Austria Top 40 and peaked at number 21 on the composite Eurochart Hot 100 Singles chart.\nA music video for the single, directed and produced by Daniel Lwowski, was filmed inside a castle in Potsdam in January 2008 and stars German actor Oliver Mommsen in a supporting role. It depicts the band as ghost-like entities, who are awakened when a foreigner visits heir home. Throughout the video, each of them tries to approach him in different ways. \"Disappear\" was performed on several television such as Willkommen bei Carmen Nebel, Unsere Besten and Music Idol. It was later featured on their compilation album Very Best of No Angels (2008).\n\"Disappear\" was written by Norwegian singer\u2013songwriter Hanne S\u00f8rvaag along with Danish musicians Remee and Thomas Troelsen, while production was handled by Remee and Troelsen. It was mixed by Will Simms and engineered by Savvas Iossifidis. Vocal editing was handled by Nicolaj Rasted. First drafts of a melody for \"Disappear\" were already in existence in 2005, with Troelsen, who also wrote the vocal melody, intensifying work on the track in January 2006. However, it took until 5 November 2007 for the song to be fully produced and provided with its final lyrics, which chronicle the aftermath of an unforgettable love affair. A S\u00f8rvaag-sung demo version of the song was recorded at the Delta Lab Recording Studios in Copenhagen and leaked through her MySpace account on 10 March 2008.\nS\u00f8rvaag's demo recording was eventually presented to A&R manager Niklas Hafemann and No Angels. One of several songs proposed for recording, \"Disappear\" was eventually accepted as the band's competition song for the German national final Grand Prix Vorentscheid 2008. The vocals for their version were recorded at the Gutleutstudios in Frankfurt am Main on 22 December 2007. Nadja Benaissa has described the song as an earworm with international ambition: \"[It's] an emotional, very sentimental [song]. With music, that's raising your spirits and carries away.\" The song premiered during an official press conference on 29 January 2008; the same day a thirty-seconds clip of the song was previewed on the band's official fansite. A day later the song was officially serviced to European radio. On 21 February 2008 an edited version of \"Disappear\" premiered on the website of daily newspaper Bild-Zeitung, which was shortened to meet the three-minutes or less ESC conditions in length.\nReleased on 29 February 2008 in German-speaking Europe, both the official CD single and the digital download single include three remixes by the Mozart & Friends team of music producers.

Musically, \"Forgive Me\" is a pop track with dance influences, written in A minor. The lyrics tell the story of a girl who has found a new love and asks her old one for forgiveness. The song was written by Aliaune \"Akon\" Thiam, Claude Kelly and Giorgio Tuinfort, and produced by the former. \"Forgive Me\" was released as the fourth single of the album in the United Kingdom on 3\u00a0November 2008. The single includes the B-side \"Myself\", written by and featuring vocals of American musician Novel.\nIn \"Forgive Me\", music critics compared Lewis's vocals with that of Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. The music video was directed by Wayne Isham, and it was inspired by multiple Broadway musicals, including Carousel and West Side Story. \"Forgive Me\" reached number five on the British and Irish charts, thus becoming Lewis's fourth single to peak within the top ten in the UK. Additionally, it peaked atop the Slovakian Singles Chart and reached the top ten in Italy and Sweden. \nLewis promoted \"Forgive Me\" on some television shows, such as GMTV and The National Lottery Live, in the United Kingdom, as well as on the Italian television show Carr\u00e0mba! Che sorpresa and on the Swedish talent show Idol. Also, the song was added to the setlists of her tours The Labyrinth (2010) and Glassheart (2013).\n\"Forgive Me\" was written by Claude Kelly, Giorgio Tuinfort and Aliaune \"Akon\" Thiam, and produced by the latter. The single was published with one B-side, \"Myself\", written by Justin E. Boykin, Graham N. Marsh, Lewis and Alonzo \"Novel\" Stevenson.\n\"Forgive Me\" is described as a \"funky pop song\", written in A minor. According to the sheet music published by Sony BMG, it moves at 120 beats per minute and is set in common time. On it, Lewis performs her highest pitch (G\u2085) in falsetto during the final chorus, and her lowest pitch (A\u2083) during each verse. \n\"Forgive Me\" describes a female protagonist in a one-sided relationship who leaves her boyfriend and eventually finds someone to reciprocate her love. Though she has found love from someone else, she defends herself and asks her ex-boyfriend for forgiveness. In an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis explained why she decided to change her musical genre from her previous singles to a more upbeat one. She said: \"I wanted to do something a bit different and the chance to work with Akon came about. I'm really pleased with how it's turned out and it's great that it's different, rather than what I always do.\" There are two versions of the song, the \"album version\" (3:40) and the \"single mix\" (3:24).\nOn 26 July 2008, the single mix was released to the Mexican iTunes Store as a stand-alone digital single. For the UK release, the single cover was revealed on 17\u00a0September 2008, whilst the song was released in the UK on 3\u00a0November 2008 as the fourth single. Originally, the song was featured only in the North American version of the album Spirit, launched in April\u00a02008. Later, \"Forgive Me\" was added in the deluxe edition of the album, which was released internationally in November\u00a02008.\nLewis performed the song on the television programmes The National Lottery Live on 29\u00a0October 2008, and GMTV on 31\u00a0October 2008. Outside of the UK, she also performed the song on the Italian television show Carr\u00e0mba! Che sorpresa and on the Swedish talent show Idol. In May\u00a02010, the song was added to the setlist of her tour The Labyrinth, performed as the eighth song of the show. A live performance from The O2 Arena was included on the live album's DVD The Labyrinth Tour Live from The O2. In 2013, Lewis added \"Forgive Me\" to the setlist of her Glassheart Tour.\n\"Forgive Me\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. CBBC's Newsround described \"Forgive Me\" as a danceable song. Gavin Martin of The Mirror gave the song three-out-of-five points and said, \"[the song] showcases her voice of fire and honey. No apologies necessary\". Nick Levine, Digital Spy music"

It was written by Stefani and co-written and produced by Tony Kanal, with additional production by Mark \"Spike\" Stent. Interscope Records serviced the song to US contemporary hit radio on May 8, 2007, as the album's third single; elsewhere it was released in June 2007. Described as one of her favorite songs on the album, Stefani began writing the song while pregnant and finished with Kanal, drawing inspiration from Roberta Flack and Billy Idol records.\nA 1980s-inspired mid-tempo synthpop ballad, \"4 in the Morning\" features a light keyboard during its intro through its break, a guitar, synthetic strings and a slick sheen. Lyrically, the song talks about a relationship on the edge, with the protagonist trying to save her love. \"4 in the Morning\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, who noted it as an improvement over her last singles, while praising its tempo and highlighting her vocals.\n\"4 in the Morning\" failed to replicate the commercial success of previous singles in the United States, peaking at number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was moderately successful elsewhere, peaking within the top-ten in Australia and New Zealand, and the top 20 in several European countries. Its accompanying music video was directed by Stefani's longtime collaborator Sophie Muller, and features Stefani lying in bed and walking around her apartment while performing the song in a melancholic mood. The song was performed during The Sweet Escape Tour and in some concerts Stefani made during 2015.\nStefani began working with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal for her second solo studio album just after finishing the Harajuku Lovers Tour in late 2005, referring to him as her \"comfort zone.\" The two wrote \"4 in the Morning\" based on a tape of melodies left from working on Stefani's debut album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). In a webisode detailing the recording process of the album, Stefani stated that she was inspired by ballads such as Roberta Flack's \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\" and Billy Idol's \"Eyes Without a Face\", as she wanted a \"nice ballad\" on the record. It was one of the last songs recorded for the album, with Stefani citing it as one of her favorite songs on The Sweet Escape, because it \"brings pleasure to [her] ears.\" The song was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on May 8, 2007 as the album's third single. A CD single, containing the album version, two remixes and its music video, was released elsewhere on June 22, 2007.\n\"4 in the Morning\" was written by Stefani and Kanal, who was also responsible for its production, while Mark \"Spike\" Stent provided additional production. Described as a 1980s-inspired mid-tempo synthpop ballad, the track's instrumentation includes a \"light\" keyboard, which \"runs tie the song together from intro through break\", a guitar, synthetic strings and a slick sheen. \"4 in the Morning\" has a mid-tempo beat, which according to some critics is \"perfect for a slow dance\". Stefani's vocals throughout the song's chorus presents a \"fast-talking\" approach. Lyrically, \"4 in the Morning\" talks about transparency in a romantic relationship, with the protagonist pleading for a lover to make up his mind. Bill Lamb of About.com added that the song also deals with a relationship on the edge, which can be seen in the lines: \"I'm lying here in the dark, I'm watching you sleep, it hurts a lot.\" In the chorus, she sings: \"I give you everything that I am/I'm handing over everything that I've got/'cause I wanna have a really true love.\"\n\"4 in the Morning\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called it \"coolly sensual\", noting that \"those celebrations of cool synths and stylish pop hooks that work the best for Stefani.\" Billboard editor Chuck Taylor called it \"a melodic retro ballad that could have come from 1983's Flashdance soundtrack\", praising the track for \"pay[ing] homage to a time when hooks were more meaningful than aligning with hostage-taking producers.\" Gary Graff of the same publication wrote that \"Stefani's Madonna reverence remains intact\" on the song, with J. Freedom du Lac from The Washington Post agreeing, noting a \"Madonnaism\" on the track. Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic also thought that the song \"recalls a 'Crazy for You'-era"

Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). It is a hip-hop song that draws influence from 1980s hip-hop and dance music. The song was written by Stefani, Pharrell Williams, and Chad Hugo, with the latter two handling production as The Neptunes. The song was released as the album's third single on March 22, 2005, and was one of the year's most popular songs, peaking inside the top 10 of the majority of the charts it entered. It reached number one in Australia and the United States, where it became the first digital download to sell one million copies.\n\"Hollaback Girl\" received several award nominations, including Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Record of the Year at the 48th Grammy Awards; however, it lost in both categories. The song divided pop music critics, with some praising its minimalistic production and others declaring it embarrassing. The men's magazine Maxim named it as the \"Most Annoying Song Ever\". In the United States, the song topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks \u2013 it was ranked at number two on the Year-End Hot 100. The single topped the charts in Australia and reached the top-ten in several other countries, including Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. It has since been certified five-times Platinum in United States by the RIAA, and in Australia by the ARIA.\nA music video with Stefani as a cheerleader at a California high school was released on March 21, 2005, and was directed by Paul Hunter. The video received four nominations at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, and ultimately won for Best Choreography. Stefani has performed \"Hollaback Girl\" on numerous occasions, including on all three of her concert tours, and on several televised appearances.\nAs part of Gwen Stefani's vision of creating \"a silly dance record\", she had worked with The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo) during the early stages of writing songs, including \"Hollaback Girl\" for her debut solo album Love. Angel. Music. Baby.; however, a case of writer's block resulted in reportedly uninspired collaborations. As the album neared completion, Stefani regained her confidence and booked another session with The Neptunes. Stefani flew to New York City to meet up with Williams, and after finishing two songs within a week, Stefani ended the session early and prepared to return home. A few minutes later, Williams called her back into the studio to write another song. Stefani said, \"I was tired. I wanted to go home, but he was like, 'Don't leave yet.'\" When she returned to the studio, Williams began to play Stefani his first solo album, and she became envious. Excited by his material, she decided to write another song with Williams, despite her opinion that the album already contained far too many tracks.\nTo search for inspiration, Stefani and Williams had a lengthy discussion in which Stefani said that she had yet to write a song about her intentions for pursuing a solo career. She remarked how the album was missing an \"attitude song\", and she recalled a derogatory comment that grunge musician Courtney Love had made about her in an interview with Seventeen magazine: \"Being famous is just like being in high school. But I'm not interested in being the cheerleader. I'm not interested in being Gwen Stefani. She's the cheerleader, and I'm out in the smoker shed.\" Stefani responded to Love's comments in the March 2005 issue of NME: \"Y'know someone one time called me a cheerleader, negatively, and I've never been a cheerleader. So I was, like, 'OK, fuck you. You want me to be a cheerleader? Well, I will be one then. And I'll rule the whole world, just you watch me.'\" The song uses the lyric and a melodic interpolation, of \"Another One Bites the Dust\" by Queen, referencing the common usage of the song at sporting events, aimed at losing opponents, with Stefani's antagonistic stance likely aimed at Love.\nStefani believed that some No Doubt fans would be upset with her solo effort, commenting, \"[They] were probably like, 'Why is she doing this record? She's going to ruin everything'.\" She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album. For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Williams incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became \"Hollaback Girl\". The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or"

Released on August 4, 2014 by Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records, and Republic Records as the second single from the album, the song was produced by Polow da Don, DJ Spydr, and Da Internz, and prominently samples \"Baby Got Back\" (1992) by Sir Mix-a-Lot. The song peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Minaj's highest charting song on the Hot 100 at the time. The song also peaked within the top ten in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, top forty in Austria, France and Portugal and top fifty in Czech Republic. \nColin Tilley directed an accompanying video for the song, which was released on August 19, 2014. Following the video's release, it broke the 24-hour streaming record on Vevo by accumulating 19.6 million views in its first day of release, which Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" later surpassed in 2015. In 2021, Anaconda became first music video for a solo female rap song to hit 1 billion views.  To further promote the song, Minaj performed it live at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and also performed it at Fashion Rocks and the iHeartRadio Music Festival. \"Anaconda\" was nominated for Best Rap Song at the 2015 Grammy Awards. The song was also nominated for two categories at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, Best Female Video and Best Hip-Hop Video, winning the latter.\nOn August 5, 2014, producer Polow da Don claimed the \"Anaconda\" instrumental was originally intended for rapper and musician Missy Elliott, but was scrapped and then re-recorded by Minaj. However, on August 24, 2014, Elliott revealed to fans and followers via her Twitter account that Polow's recollections were untrue and additionally confirmed that she never received the alleged instrumental. The cover art for the single went viral on the web after being revealed. On various digital music stores, the cover art is censored with the Parental Advisory label over Minaj's buttocks. The song heavily samples \"Baby Got Back\" by Sir Mix-a-Lot, who also has vocals in the chorus of the song.\nThe song has been viewed by some as a diss track, in answer to \"Baby Got Back\". Whereas Sir Mix-a-Lot focuses on a woman's body and the pleasure it gives him, Minaj raps from the perspective of the unnamed woman, and shows how she uses her body to profit and empower herself.\nAccording to Minaj's sound engineer Aubry \"Big Juice\" Delaine, \"Anaconda\" had 27 different versions at first. Production team Da Internz were then brought in to add drums to the song, whereafter it was sent for mixing and mastering, which made it \"perfect\".\nMusically, the song is a hip hop and pop-rap song. The song is written in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 130 beats per minute.\nCarolyn Menyes from Music Times said it is a bit \"raunchy\" though this was \"expected\" and saying \"Anaconda\" continues Minaj's promise to move away from her poppier singles such as \"Super Bass\" and \"Starships\", and go back to her hardcore rap roots. Kory Grow from Rolling Stone praised the use of the \"Baby Got Back\" sample and said the song stayed true to the theme of the original. Kevin Goddard from HotNewHipHop said \"Nicki's raunchy new version may be the next big thing to hit the industry.\" Dan Reilly from Spin said \"Minaj takes the good Sir's '92 ode to protruding posteriors and adds a heavy dose of 2014 sex lingo.\" Amy Davidson from Digital Spy gave the song three stars out of five and said that \"Nicki's breaking down barriers.\"\nSir Mix-a-Lot said he had, \"a whole new level of respect for Minaj\" after hearing the record and that he became a \"fan for life\" of Minaj.\nThe song made Spin's end of year 'The 101 Best Songs of 2014' list. It ranked #3 on the list of 101 entries and Spin herald it \"much more than just a song\" but a \"cultural movement.\" She was the only rapper to make the top ten of the list as a lead artist. \"Anaconda\" was also placed at number two on MTV's Best Songs of 2014.\nHowever, despite the positive reviews the song received negative reactions. The London Economic called it \"one of the worst songs ever.\" Critics from National Review referred to the song as \"degrading,\" adding that it promoted prostitution, drug abuse and immorality to young girls. A city in Israel banned the song and prohibited"

Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). It is a hip-hop song that draws influence from 1980s hip-hop and dance music. The song was written by Stefani, Pharrell Williams, and Chad Hugo, with the latter two handling production as The Neptunes. The song was released as the album's third single on March 22, 2005, and was one of the year's most popular songs, peaking inside the top 10 of the majority of the charts it entered. It reached number one in Australia and the United States, where it became the first digital download to sell one million copies.\n\"Hollaback Girl\" received several award nominations, including Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Record of the Year at the 48th Grammy Awards; however, it lost in both categories. The song divided pop music critics, with some praising its minimalistic production and others declaring it embarrassing. The men's magazine Maxim named it as the \"Most Annoying Song Ever\". In the United States, the song topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks \u2013 it was ranked at number two on the Year-End Hot 100. The single topped the charts in Australia and reached the top-ten in several other countries, including Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. It has since been certified five-times Platinum in United States by the RIAA, and in Australia by the ARIA.\nA music video with Stefani as a cheerleader at a California high school was released on March 21, 2005, and was directed by Paul Hunter. The video received four nominations at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, and ultimately won for Best Choreography. Stefani has performed \"Hollaback Girl\" on numerous occasions, including on all three of her concert tours, and on several televised appearances.\nAs part of Gwen Stefani's vision of creating \"a silly dance record\", she had worked with The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo) during the early stages of writing songs, including \"Hollaback Girl\" for her debut solo album Love. Angel. Music. Baby.; however, a case of writer's block resulted in reportedly uninspired collaborations. As the album neared completion, Stefani regained her confidence and booked another session with The Neptunes. Stefani flew to New York City to meet up with Williams, and after finishing two songs within a week, Stefani ended the session early and prepared to return home. A few minutes later, Williams called her back into the studio to write another song. Stefani said, \"I was tired. I wanted to go home, but he was like, 'Don't leave yet.'\" When she returned to the studio, Williams began to play Stefani his first solo album, and she became envious. Excited by his material, she decided to write another song with Williams, despite her opinion that the album already contained far too many tracks.\nTo search for inspiration, Stefani and Williams had a lengthy discussion in which Stefani said that she had yet to write a song about her intentions for pursuing a solo career. She remarked how the album was missing an \"attitude song\", and she recalled a derogatory comment that grunge musician Courtney Love had made about her in an interview with Seventeen magazine: \"Being famous is just like being in high school. But I'm not interested in being the cheerleader. I'm not interested in being Gwen Stefani. She's the cheerleader, and I'm out in the smoker shed.\" Stefani responded to Love's comments in the March 2005 issue of NME: \"Y'know someone one time called me a cheerleader, negatively, and I've never been a cheerleader. So I was, like, 'OK, fuck you. You want me to be a cheerleader? Well, I will be one then. And I'll rule the whole world, just you watch me.'\" The song uses the lyric and a melodic interpolation, of \"Another One Bites the Dust\" by Queen, referencing the common usage of the song at sporting events, aimed at losing opponents, with Stefani's antagonistic stance likely aimed at Love.\nStefani believed that some No Doubt fans would be upset with her solo effort, commenting, \"[They] were probably like, 'Why is she doing this record? She's going to ruin everything'.\" She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album. For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Williams incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became \"Hollaback Girl\".

It is the second track on their tenth studio album, All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), and was released as the album's second single on 29 January 2001. The band's lead vocalist Bono has said the song was inspired by a fictional conversation with his friend Michael Hutchence about suicide. The song peaked at number 52 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, their native Ireland and Italy, while reaching the top 10 in Australia, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Spain and the United Kingdom. In 2002, the song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" originated from a gospel-influenced chord progression that guitarist the Edge composed on a piano in a Japanese hotel room. He said: \"I suppose I was consciously looking for something in that [gospel] tradition. Having been through that whole experimentation period during Pop\u2014with techno and dance ideas and dance aesthetics\u2014it seemed like I wanted to get back to something a bit more earthy.\" During the recording sessions for All That You Can't Leave Behind, the Edge played the piano piece in a music sequencer, after which co-producer Brian Eno removed every first and second note, leaving every third note. Eno then set it into a different keyboard with extensive treatments, resulting in what the Edge called an \"otherworldly effect\" on top of his \"traditional gospel piano sequence\". Co-producer Daniel Lanois said the recorded version of the song was essentially a live take performed by the band with him and Eno. On guitar, Lanois played \"the harmony to The Edge's part\". The Edge achieved a clean guitar tone by plugging his 1950s Fender Stratocaster guitar directly into a Fender Bassman amplifier. The song ends with a \"choral chant\" written by the Edge; Lanois said they had always wanted to compose such a part before. The group tried several variations of it before settling on the version that appears on record. The vocals were sung by the Edge, Lanois, and Eno; Lanois said it was easy to imagine hiring a choir to sing the part but \"if you want it to sound like a U2 record, then you use the team\". Mick Jagger and his daughter Elizabeth recorded backing vocals for the song, although these did not make the final mix.\nU2's lead singer Bono wrote the lyrics about the suicide of his close friend Michael Hutchence, lead singer of the band INXS. The song is written in the form of an argument about suicide in which Bono tries to convince Hutchence of the act's foolishness. Bono characterised the song as a fight between friends, which he felt guilty for never having with Hutchence. As Bono said in 2005, \"It's a row between mates. You're kinda trying to wake them up out of an idea. In my case it's a row I didn't have while he was alive. I feel the biggest respect I could pay to him was not to write some stupid soppy song, so I wrote a really tough, nasty little number, slapping him around the head. And I'm sorry, but that's how it came out of me.\"\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" was released in the UK on 29 January 2001, in Australia on 12 February 2001, in the United States on 6 August 2001, and in Canada on 30 October 2001.\nThe song was performed at every show on the Elevation Tour in 2001. The song was not played again until the third leg on the Vertigo Tour in 2005 in an acoustic form by Bono and The Edge. The full band electric version was revived for the sixth leg of the Vertigo Tour in 2006. The song was performed on the U2 360\u00b0 Tour, again in an acoustic form by Bono and The Edge. The song was played five times on the Innocence + Experience Tour. These performances were by the full band and featured The Edge on the piano. The song was not performed on the Experience + Innocence Tour in 2018, but was played during many promotional shows for the Songs of Experience album. It made two appearances on The Joshua Tree Tour 2019. Both performances were in Sydney and were dedicated to Michael Hutchence.\nThree official music videos were filmed for the song. The first video (known as the US version) is directed by Joseph Kahn, features an American football game between the \"Flys\" [sic] and the \"Lemons\" filmed at the Houston Astrodome, and"

It later peaked at number two, kept out of the summit by Drake's \"God's Plan\". It became Rexha's third top ten hit and her first as a solo lead artist, as well as the second top ten hit for Florida Georgia Line.

That same day, the album's original version was sent to US adult contemporary radio and a new orchestral version was released digitally.

Cabello's vocals span from G\u2083 to A\u2085.\n\nAlexis Petridis of The Guardian portrayed, \"The piano ballad Consequences is an unexpected triumph: eschewing the usual melodramatics, Cabello\u2019s vocal is controlled, delicate and affecting, while the accompaniment vaguely recalls \u2013 of all things \u2013 Asleep by the Smiths.\"\nWriting for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined the track, \"Consequences exhibits greater-than-average originality. 'Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating,' croons Cabello; 'loving you had consequences'.\" Dennis Leupold of Rolling Stone expressed, \"this girl definitely puts more of her heart into the emo. Cabello has a real flair for melancholy piano break-up ballads, as in 'Consequences,' where she ponders the high price of love: 'Dirty tissues, trust issues.'\" Jamieson Cox of Pitchfork stated that \"The overwrought one-two punch of 'Consequences'\u2014which sounds a little like her attempt at something like Rihanna's 'Stay'\" Sam Lansky of Time applauded its \"pretty-ballad\" songwriting for showcasing Cabello's voice while citing the song as a \"heartfelt\" track both lyrically and musically.\nNick Levine of NME penned, \"Stripped-down piano ballad \u2018Consequences\u2019 feels even more candid: she tells a former partner that 'loving you was dumb and dark and cheap,' and says she 'lost a little weight because I wasn't eating.'\"\nA music video for the orchestral version, directed by Dave Meyers, was released on October 10, 2018. It featured an appearance by Dylan Sprouse. In the video, Cabello and Sprouse run around, kiss and make music together. Cabello walks around a park while reminiscing about the couple's relationship.

The song was written by Lavigne, David Hodges, Chad Kroeger, Jacob Kasher, and its producer Martin Johnson. It was released as the lead single from the album on April 9, 2013, by Epic Records. \"Here's To Never Growing Up\" is a midtempo pop rock song that talks about a \"celebration of being forever young\" and features a reference to English alternative rock band Radiohead.\nMusic critics provided mixed reviews to \"Here's To Never Growing Up\" and drew comparisons between the song and songs by Lavigne's contemporaries Katy Perry, Kesha, and Taylor Swift. The single was an international success, reaching number one on the Taiwan and Philippines charts, while reaching the top ten in Belgium, China, Ireland, Japan, Russia, Scotland, South Korea, South Africa and Ukraine, also reaching the top twenty in Australia, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States despite the lack of initial exposure. It achieved certifications by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) due to the chart success.\nAn accompanying music video for \"Here's To Never Growing Up\" was directed by Robert Hales. It features Lavigne and her band performing at the school's prom, and resembles to the music video for her 2002 single \"Complicated\". The video gained positive feedback from critics, who praised Lavigne's look in the clip. Due to the song's success, Lavigne performed \"Here's To Never Growing Up\" on a number of shows, including Dancing with the Stars, Today and The Voice UK. The song is playable in the video game Guitar Hero Live.\n\"Here's To Never Growing Up\" was written by Lavigne, David Hodges, Chad Kroeger, Jacob Kasher, and producer of the song Martin Johnson. The song was recorded in early 2013 at Henson Recording Studios. During an interview with Ryan Seacrest for 102.7 KIIS-FM show, Lavigne said, \"I wanted to write something fun and summery. It's about being young, wanting to be young forever, living in the moment and having a blast\". Talking about the song's conception to 4Music, Lavigne revealed that she missed her high school prom so much, and that was the reason why she wrote \"Here's To Never Growing Up\". She said, \"When I was writing it, I was thinking about being younger \u2013 I\u2019m still in my 20s, but you know, like high school \u2013 and with my 20s being in music and everything, I love the concept of 'simply prom' for the video\". Lavigne announced the song would be released as the first single from her fifth studio album on 8 February 2013 via Twitter. Lavigne later revealed the single's official artwork as well as its release date via Twitter on April 3, 2013. Epic Records premiered \"Here's to Never Growing Up\" on On Air with Ryan Seacrest (KIIS-FM) radio show, on iTunes Stores and eventually sent the single to US contemporary hit radio station on April 9, 2013.\n\"Here's To Never Growing Up\" is a midtempo pop rock song, with a moderate tempo of 82 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F major. Lavigne's vocal range in the track spans from the low-note of A\u2083 to the high-note of C\u2085. The \"punchy\" song is built around a \"big, kick-drum\" stomp, acoustic-guitar-strumming, and simple-minded tunes. Digital Spy editor Robert Cospey wrote the song has a \"pumping guitars 'n drums melody\". Melinda Newman from HitFix thought that \"Here's to Never Growing Up\" is a \"throwback\" to Kesha's \"Tik Tok\" (2009) and Lavigne's \"Girlfriend\" (2007) for the same musical structure.\nLyrically, the song talks about a \"celebration of being forever young\". In the song, Lavigne sings about the things she's going to do that she believes will keep her forever young, such as getting drunk and dancing on a bar, running down the street screaming profanities, blasting music and staying up all night. At the beginning, Lavigne sings \"Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs\", referencing the rock band Radiohead, which is also featured in the chorus. At the chorus, she continues \"We'll be running down the street yelling kiss my ass\", followed by an \"ear-snagging chant\" of \"oh-woah-oh\". Lavigne declares her celebration at the second verse, \"This is who we are/ I don't think we'll ever change/ They say 'Just grow up,' but they don't know us/ We don't give a fuck!\".\n\n\"Here's To Never Growing Up\" received mixed reviews from contemporary critics.

It was released as the second single from her second solo album, Come and Get It (2005). It was written and produced by Pascal Gabriel and Hannah Robinson. The song was released on 4 July 2005 as a CD single and digital download. It debuted and peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Stevens' fifth top 10 single and her last top 10 to date.\nThe song was recorded in 2005 at Wandsworth Studios which was shown on Stevens' television documentary \"Rachel Stevens: My World\" and was one of the first songs that she recorded for the album. Stevens stated in the documentary that the song had helped her \"find her sound for the album\". The track was mixed at 21 Studios in London for its release.\nThe song received positive reviews from music critics who praised its production and Stevens' vocals, with some labelling it as \"much ahead of its time\". Some critics described it as the \"I Will Survive of the 21st century\" due its lyrical content in which Stevens declares that she has \"made it on her own again\" and will \"feel so good\" after ending a relationship.\n\"So Good\" was released on 4 July 2005 as two CD singles and a digital download in the United Kingdom. The first CD contains a radio edit of the track and a Milky Vocal Mix of Breathe In, Breathe Out and the second CD also contains a radio edit, an Aurora Vocal Mix, a previously unreleased track \"Never Go Back\" and an enhanced section that contains the music video, karaoke video and game.\nAfter Stevens' previous single \"Negotiate With Love\" peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, expectations were high for \"So Good\" to chart higher due to stronger radio airplay and receiving more positive reviews. However, it failed to do so and also peaked at number 10 with first-week sales of 11,750 copies, lasting eight weeks on the chart, a week longer than \"Negotiate With Love\". To date, it is Stevens's last single to peak within the top 10.\n\nPrior to the video's release, a behind the scenes for the video was shown on GMTV. The music video for \"So Good\" was directed by Cameron Casey and was filmed in June 2005 at a studio in London.\nThe video features Stevens with a group of four men in a dark metallic room, dancing in front of a wall of flashing coloured lights. In some scenes, Stevens is lying on a circular shaped stage with the flashing lights in the background and other scenes show the four men dancing individually on the stage. Throughout the video, there are many close-up shots of Stevens with the lights behind her. During the bridge of the song, Stevens and the four men do a fast robot styled dance routine. In the video, she has a braided hairstyle and is wearing a black ballerina-like dress and sports pink mid-hand gloves.\nThe pink mid-hand gloves Stevens wore in the video gained a cult following because of the British pop website Popjustice, where they were the subject of a front-page article and a special message board discussion forum. In an interview with GMTV, Stevens stated that the pink gloves were to give the outfit some colour and also due to the hand orientated dance routine.\nCD single\n\"So Good\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:13\n\"Breathe In, Breathe Out\" (Milky Vocal Mix) \u2013 5:57\nCD maxi single\n\"So Good\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:13\n\"So Good\" (Aurora Vocal Mix) \u2013 7:32\n\"Never Go Back\" (Hannah Robinson, Johnny Pearson, Martin Buttrich, Rachel Stevens) \u2013 3:19\n\"So Good\" (video)\n\"So Good\" (karaoke video)\n\"So Good\" (game)\n\"So Good\" (ringtone)\nDigital EP\n\"So Good\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:14\n\"So Good\" (Aurora Vocal Mix) \u2013 7:32\n\"Never Go Back\" \u2013 3:21\nDigital single\n\"So Good\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:14\n\"Breathe in Breathe Out\" (Milky Vocal Mix) \u2013 5:59\n\n\n\n\nHoffman, K.

The song was also produced by Alex da Kid and released for digital download through the American iTunes Store on February 1, 2011.\nMusically, \"I Need a Doctor\" is predominantly a rap song, backed by a \"spacey\", drum-heavy production, with extra piano keys featured in the introduction and the chorus. Lyrically, the song is largely about Dr. Dre and Eminem's close friendship, and how they have often needed and inspired each other in the past.\nEven though the song was leaked onto the Internet several months in advance of its release, it became a significant commercial success on its official release, particularly in the United States, where it peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Dr. Dre's second highest peaking song on the chart ever. It also peaked in the upper regions of many other national charts. As of October 2011, it had sold over 2,206,000 digital copies in the United States alone.\nThe official version premiered through Dr. Dre's official website.\nSkylar Grey said that she and da Kid came to the studio with the hook and \"the track\" prepared; [Dre and Eminem] loved it. Eminem had then gone into the back room, and came out two hours later, and said that he was done writing his verses. Grey also said that she was in tears when she heard Eminem's verses for the first time and that da Kid initially proposed featuring Lady Gaga on the hook, but Eminem insisted on having Grey's vocals, and said that they were not taking her voice off the track. In the song Eminem raps two verses about his mentor, thanking Dre for believing in him in his early days and returning the favor, before Dre delivers the song's final verse. The song's theme is about Dre's life, how it affected him, and that Eminem would be there for him since he was always there for Eminem.\nThe video for \"I Need a Doctor\" was shot with Allen Hughes, the director of Menace II Society, From Hell and The Book of Eli.  The video premiered on February 24, 2011.\nThe video begins with an introduction of Dr. Dre's music career, such as when he and fellow N.W.A member DJ Yella were in the 1980s funk group World Class Wreckin' Cru. There are also scenes of Dr. Dre and his family, such as him hugging his daughter and son and getting married. There are also snippets from past music videos. It includes many rappers such as Eazy-E, 2Pac, The D.O.C, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Nate Dogg, Eminem, Xzibit and all the rest of the members from N.W.A. The video then features Dr. Dre driving down Pacific Coast Highway in a Ferrari 360, with flashbacks of his life, crashing his car and the last thing heard was his daughter say \"Good night Daddy.\" Then he is transported to a medical facility. The date at the beginning of the video is February 18, 2001 (his 36th birthday). They fast-forward to present day ten years later, where he has been hospitalized and is on life support. The Marin County Civic Center stands in for the medical facility. HP Touchstone / Touch-to-Share technology is featured as the way medical data is transferred from the doctor's phone to the medical tablet.  Eminem raps next to him as he is floating in an isolation tank, during which the figure of the Pythia (played by Canadian actress Estella Warren) is singing as a hologram behind and over Dre, mouthing the words to Skylar Grey's vocal part in the song. Skylar Grey herself appears as one of the doctors in the video, but never actually appears singing her part. Dre eventually wakes up and goes through rehab, and the video ends with him standing next to the grave of Eazy-E, a rapper who had launched Dre's music career by founding N.W.A and was also a member along with Ice Cube, MC Ren and DJ Yella. A ticking clock is heard midway through the video. The music video received complaints of being an \"act of advertising\" for a variety of product placements, such as Ferrari, G-Shock, HP, Gatorade, and Dr. Dre's signature headphones, Beats by Dr. Dre.\nOn August 17, 2012 the music video was VEVOCertified after receiving more than 100,000,000 views on YouTube.\nDr. Dre, Eminem and Skylar Grey performed the song at the 2011 Grammy Awards as part of a medley with \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" performed by Rihanna, Adam Levine and Eminem.\nEminem performed the first verse at the 2012 Coachella Festival.\nNick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song a very positive review - rating the song five stars out of"

The song features vocals from Canadian and Young Money rapper Drake, and is produced by American hip-hop producer Kane Beatz. The song is also written by rapper and producer Andrew Canton. The song achieved reasonable chart success, particularly in the United States where it peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Digital Songs chart, and also charted modestly internationally.\nUpon its release, the song received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented its confident, upbeat tone and the performances of both rappers, with many praising it as a highlight off the album. The song was later certified 4x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of 4 million equivalent units.\nThe song serves as the opening theme for the HBO series Ballers, starring Dwayne Johnson.\nAlong with all of the other songs on I Am Not a Human Being, the song was recorded in 2010 prior to Wayne's nine-month prison term for criminal possession of a weapon. The song contains a vocal sample from the 2Pac song \"Hail Mary\": more specifically, it samples the line \"I ain't a killer but don't push me\".\nThe song premiered on August 3, 2010 on the New York urban contemporary radio station Hot 97. On the same evening, the show's host Funkmaster Flex conducted an interview with Lil Wayne from Rikers Island prison, who announced that the song would be released as a  single, amongst discussing I Am Not a Human Being, although the release date was not announced at the time. The single was officially digitally released in the United States on August 17, 2010.\nOn December 31, 2010 Lil Wayne performed the song on NBC's New Year's Eve with Carson Daly. As Drake was not available to sing his verse, it was not featured in the performance. Lil Wayne and Drake performed the song on 106 and Park on December 31, 2010.\nThe song received generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic writer David Jefferies called the song \"grand\" stating that it \"swaggers and struts like a free man cruising through the club\". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described the song as \"bombastic\" and praised Lil Wayne's musical diversity, comparing the song to more recent hits (\"I'm Single\" and \"No Love\") and their different musical styles, stating \"[his] successes in the last few months have been in different, and divergent, modes... diversity is Lil Wayne\u2019s strength\". Despite describing the song as \"generic\", Los Angeles Times writer Jeff Weiss wrote positively of the song, stating that \"[it] achieves a kind of bizarre solipsism\". However, he also felt that \"Wayne\u2019s done this shtick better before\".\nAfter experiencing strong digital sales on release, the song debuted at number 6 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart dated September 4, 2010, making it the highest debuting song on the chart for that week, and at number 1 on the Billboard Hot Digital Songs chart, becoming the first Lil Wayne song to top this chart. With 225,000 copies downloaded during the first week, it was Wayne's best sales week as a lead artist and as of December 27 the single has sold over a million copies. The song also peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart, and also at number four on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n\"Right Above It\" also achieved modest international charting. The song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 37 on 5 September 2010 following strong digital downloading from the album. This marks Lil Wayne's second Top 40 hit in the UK after \"Lollipop\" peaked at number 26 during 2008. The single also peaked at number 11 on the UK R&B Chart. The song also peaked at number 34 in Canada, and number 27 in Belgium.\nAs of June\u00a02015, the song is featured in the opening of the HBO television series Ballers.

The song was written and produced by Cruz alongside Fraser T Smith, and later released as the album's third single on 5 April 2010. Originally, Cruz wanted the female vocals to be done by Lady Gaga but opted to switch to Kesha due to heavy influence by Dr. Luke and for finding her voice unique. The song was later re-recorded as an album bonus track for Kesha's debut album, Animal (2010), and dubbed the \"Kesha edit\" or \"Dirty Picture Pt. 2\". Lyrically, the song is about sending a dirty picture to a significant other whom you miss.\nCritical reception of the song was generally positive. Kesha and Cruz's collaboration and vocal work on the track were generally praised, although some critics noted that Kesha overtook the track, outshining Cruz. The song's simple but effective lyrics were also positively received by music critics. Commercially, \"Dirty Picture\" fared well on the music charts. The song peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart, and at number ten in Ireland. The song also reached the top forty in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The song's accompanying music video was filmed in Los Angeles and London and is presented as taking place in a house party.\nA \"spanglish version\" of \"Dirty Picture\" was released as a bonus track from Rokstarr Spanish edition features vocals by Mexican popstar Paulina Rubio. It unfolds with \"Rubio Latiniz[ing] the half Brazilian R&B singer\u2019s track by sensually breathing in her raspy voice.\"\n\"Dirty Picture\" was written and produced by Taio Cruz, in collaboration with Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: \"I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and he was telling me about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this \u2013 I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it.\"\n\"Dirty Picture\" is song composed in the dance genre, that encompasses a techno beat infused in its backing, as well as synthesizers. The song features auto-tuned vocals by Kesha. According to Robert Cospey of Digital Spy, the song's chorus contains \"trancey\" elements and is reminiscent of Benny Benassi's song, \"Satisfaction\". Lyrically, Cruz explained the song's message saying, \"the song is actually about sending sexy pictures to your significant other, if you miss each other and you can't see each other, you're far away from each other, you send pictures to remind each other of how sexy you are.\" According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, \"Dirty Picture\" is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate beat rate of 125 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of F Minor; Cruz' vocal range spans from the note of Eb\u2084 to the note of F\u2085.\n\n\"Dirty Picture\" received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly compared the song to Cruz' prior single \"Break Your Heart\", noting that Cruz had \"struck gold\" with the song and that \"Dirty Picture\" was the only song on the album with \"equal caliber.\" In a review of the album, Mike Diver of BBC wrote that the song was \"the kind of track Sugababes should be patching up their every difference ever for.\" In a separate publication from BBC, Fraser McAlpine wrote that although the song's lyrics were dumb, silly and crude, \"none of [these] are bad things in themselves.\" McAlpine complimented the overall sound of Kesha and Cruz's vocal work together on the song commenting that \"the jarring clash between Taio's supersmooth soul-gentleman image and Kesha's sloppy drunken nonsense is"

It was originally recorded by the Temptations in 1971. Producer Norman Whitfield had the song re-recorded by the Undisputed Truth the same year, resulting in a number-three Billboard Hot 100 position for the group. \"Smiling Faces\" was the only Top 40 single released by the Undisputed Truth, and was included on their debut album The Undisputed Truth.\nBoth versions of \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\" deal with the same subject matter, \"back-stabbing\" friends who do their friends wrong behind their backs (\"Smiling faces sometimes...they don't tell the truth...smiling faces tell lies\"), but in different ways. The lyrics inform the Listener to not be fooled by the smile, the handshake, or the pat on the back. The Temptations' original uses an arrangement similar to a haunted house film score to represent feelings of fear and timidness.

It was originally recorded by the Temptations in 1971. Producer Norman Whitfield had the song re-recorded by the Undisputed Truth the same year, resulting in a number-three Billboard Hot 100 position for the group. \"Smiling Faces\" was the only Top 40 single released by the Undisputed Truth, and was included on their debut album The Undisputed Truth.\nBoth versions of \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\" deal with the same subject matter, \"back-stabbing\" friends who do their friends wrong behind their backs (\"Smiling faces sometimes...they don't tell the truth...smiling faces tell lies\"), but in different ways. The lyrics inform the Listener to not be fooled by the smile, the handshake, or the pat on the back. The Temptations' original uses an arrangement similar to a haunted house film score to represent feelings of fear and timidness. Included on the 1971 Sky's the Limit album, \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\" runs over 12 minutes, most of which is extended instrumental passages without any vocals. This version established the epic, cinematic approach to the group's productions that Whitfield would perfect on subsequent hits like \"Papa Was a Rolling Stone\" (1972) and \"Masterpiece\" (1973).

The song, which was written by Babyface, was the lead single from their second album, II. It was a commercial success, spending 14 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. It was also the third best performing song in the 1990s on Billboard, as well as ranking on Billboard Greatest of All-Time chart. It won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and was nominated for Record of the Year.\n\nLarry Flick from Billboard described \"I'll Make Love to You\" as a \"sweeping pop/R&B ballad\". He added, \"Silky harmonies waft over a well-measured arrangement chock-ful of bright, glistening synths and soft-yet-punctuating percussion. Lovely sing-along chorus initially will remind many of past glories, but single ultimately will provide a refreshing cool breeze to any of numerous radio formats it graces.\" Music writer James Masterton deemed it \"another piece of immaculate close-harmony soul\", that \"is a smash before it has ever started\". Pan-European magazine Music & Media commented, \"Silkier then the First Lady's nightgown, the first single off the \"mommy\" Boyz's upcoming album II further secures their position as the masters of the close harmony ballad.\" Alan Jones from Music Week rated it four out of five. He wrote, \"Returning after more than a year, Boyz II Men get back into the End Of The Road groove with a silky, powerful ballad penned by BabyFace. Its sweeping majesty is likely to push it high into the chart.\" Gerald Martinez from New Sunday Times noted that the song, with \"On Bended Knee\", \"tries to recapture the magic of End Of The Road, and they come close. Big production numbers with solid hooks, they should be flooding our airwaves for the next few months.\" Mark Sutherland from Smash Hits gave it three out of five, saying, \"Weeell, in their favour are the facts that they are still the meanest warblers in pop and that soul doesn't come much more silky or supersmooth than this. Against them is the fact that this is basically just End Of The Road with new lyrics \u2013 and blimmin' presumptuous lyrics at that.\"\nThe single was a massive commercial success. It held the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks, from August 27 to November 26, 1994. At the time, the song tied a record for the most weeks at number one that had been set by Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" in late 1992 and early 1993. Boyz II Men would later break their own record in 1996 with \"One Sweet Day\", a collaboration with Mariah Carey, which remained at number one on the Hot 100 for 16 weeks beginning in December 1995. \"I'll Make Love to You\" also topped the U.S. R&B and adult contemporary charts for nine and three weeks, respectively, in 1994. It sold 1,627,000 copies domestically, earning a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of over one million copies. In Canada, the song reached number one on September 26, retaining the position for two weeks. \"All I Wanna Do\" by Sheryl Crow then held the top position for four weeks, but on November 2, \"I'll Make Love to You\" returned to number one for an additional week before beginning its final descent from the chart.\nOutside North America, \"I'll Make Love to You\" also experienced major chart success. It reached number one in New Zealand on September 11, keeping that position for four weeks before \"Endless Love\" by Luther Vandross and Mariah Carey moved to number one. In Australia, the song reached the top on October 16 and stayed there for two weeks, losing its spot at number one to Silverchair's \"Tomorrow\". On both charts, the song stayed in the top 50 for 22 weeks. Across Europe, the song reached the top 10 in most countries, but fell outside this range in Germany and Finland, where it peaked at 20 and 12, respectively. In the UK, the song debuted at number 6 on the Official Singles Chart on August 28 before moving up to number 5 the next week, its peak position. It stayed in the top 40 for a further eight weeks. In Ireland, the song was slightly less successful, reaching number 7 and spending 10 weeks on the chart.\n\"I'll Make Love to You\" won the 1995 Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and two American Music Awards for Favorite Pop/Rock Single and Favorite Soul/R&B Single. It ranks at number 19 on Billboard's All-Time Top 100 Songs.\nThe accompanying music video for \"I'll Make Love to You\" was directed by American music video director, film director and VJ"

It was released in April 2011 as the first single from Shelton's 2011 album Red River Blue. The song reached number one on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in July 2011. On November 30, the song received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Solo Performance, but it lost to Taylor Swift's \"Mean\".\nBlake Shelton debuted \"Honey Bee\" at the Academy of Country Music awards telecast on April 3, 2011, where he also sang \"Who Are You When I'm Not Looking\". \"Honey Bee\" was released to digital retailers immediately after the broadcast.\nRhett Akins and Ben Hayslip, two-thirds of the \"Peach Pickers\" writing ensemble, wrote the song. Akins said that he first thought of writing a song called \"Huckleberry\" after seeing an article in Billboard magazine about former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. He then changed the word to \"honeysuckle\", and came up with the line \"You be my honeysuckle, and I'll be your honey bee.\" Akins said that he thought that \"it was a different way for the guy to say, 'we should date, I love you.'\"\nThe lines \"You'll be my Louisiana, I'll be your Mississippi / You'll be my Little Loretta, I'll be your Conway Twitty\" refers to the Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn duet \"Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man\" on the album of the same name.\nThe music video premiered on NBC.com on May 10, 2011. It was filmed in California, and directed by Trey Fanjoy.\nThe video features Shelton stopping at a roadside stand, where a young woman (portrayed by Amra Silajd\u017ei\u0107) is selling honey and other related products.  Shelton purchases a jar of \"Tupelo Honey\" from the seller.  Shelton frequently returns to the stand, buying more and more products (which, as the video changes scenes from the stand to Shelton's living room, the room becomes more and more filled with products from the stand), until one day he passes the stand and sees an \"out of business\" sign.  The seller approaches with another sign (\"Sorry, out of honey\") and Shelton finally gets her to come with him.\n\nMatt Bjorke of Roughstock rated the single four stars out of five. His review praised the \"charisma\" in Shelton's voice and thought that the song had a \"timeless\" feel to it. Slant Magazine reviewer Jonathan Keefe criticized the lyrics, but praised Shelton's vocals. C. M. Wilcox of The 9513 gave the song a thumbs down, saying that the lyrics were written in a \"repetitive, fill-in-the-blank structure,\" and criticized Shelton for recording \"ear catching but substantively bankrupt country boy hokum.\"\nThe song sold 138,000 digital downloads in its first week, setting a record for the most first-week downloads by a male country singer. As a result of the downloads, the song debuted at number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated for the week ending April 23, 2011. This entry makes him the highest-debuting male country artist on the Hot 100 since Garth Brooks (recording as Chris Gaines) debuted at number five in September 1999 with \"Lost in You\". \"Honey Bee\" also debuted at number 31 on the Hot Country Songs charts and number 58 on the Canadian Hot 100. By its seventh week, the song had gone digital gold, making it the fastest rising single ever to sell over 500,000 digital copies by a male country soloist. It became Shelton's fourth consecutive and ninth Number One single on the country chart dated June 25, 2011.  It has sold 2,372,000 copies in the US as of September 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nStromblad, Cory (April 4, 2011). \"Blake Shelton Debuts New Song, 'Honey Bee'\". The Boot.

It was written by Swift and Liz Rose, and produced by Nathan Chapman, and was released on June 19, 2006 by Big Machine Records as the lead single from Swift's self-titled debut album. She wrote \"Tim McGraw\" during her freshman year of high school, knowing that she and her senior boyfriend would break up at the end of the year when he left for college. The song was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together once he departed, such as the songs by Tim McGraw, one of Swift's favorite county artists. \"Tim McGraw\" blends traditional and modern country music.\n\"Tim McGraw\" performed well commercially. The track spent various weeks on both the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs; it peaked at number 40 on the former and number six on the latter. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold more than one million copies since its release. The accompanying music video for \"Tim McGraw\", directed by Trey Fanjoy, comprises flashbacks by Swift's love interest, among cut scenes that feature Swift lying on a lake bed. \"Tim McGraw\" was promoted by Swift on a radio tour and performances in numerous venues. Swift performed it while serving as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. She also performed it as part of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour (2009\u201310). The single was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), indicating more than 2 million units sold in the US.\nTaylor Swift and Liz Rose wrote \"Tim McGraw\" during Swift's freshman year at Hendersonville High School. She conceived the idea in the midst of her mathematics class: \"I was just sitting there, and I started humming this melody.\" She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment. Swift knew that she and her senior boyfriend would break up at the end of the year when he left for college. In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music, \"with the idea and the melody, knowing exactly what she wanted.\" She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone. It was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. \"To her surprise, the first thing that came to mind was [her] love of Tim McGraw's music.\" Several personal details were listed for the song. McGraw's mentioning was a reference to Swift's favorite song, \"Can't Tell Me Nothin\" from his 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying, rather than McGraw as a person. The writing process, as with \"Our Song\", took place in approximately twenty minutes, and was executed with the use of a piano.\nSoon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to his newly formed label. Early into the album production, in a meeting where Borchetta and Swift discussed potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed \"Tim McGraw\" for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, \"That's your first single.\" She responded, \"Well. That's how that works then.\" Prior to that event, Swift did not believe that the song was single material. However, she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct. Swift placed \"Tim McGraw\" as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her. The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19, 2006.

It was written by Swift and Liz Rose, and produced by Nathan Chapman, and was released on June 19, 2006 by Big Machine Records as the lead single from Swift's self-titled debut album. She wrote \"Tim McGraw\" during her freshman year of high school, knowing that she and her senior boyfriend would break up at the end of the year when he left for college. The song was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together once he departed, such as the songs by Tim McGraw, one of Swift's favorite county artists. \"Tim McGraw\" blends traditional and modern country music.\n\"Tim McGraw\" performed well commercially. The track spent various weeks on both the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs; it peaked at number 40 on the former and number six on the latter. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold more than one million copies since its release. The accompanying music video for \"Tim McGraw\", directed by Trey Fanjoy, comprises flashbacks by Swift's love interest, among cut scenes that feature Swift lying on a lake bed. \"Tim McGraw\" was promoted by Swift on a radio tour and performances in numerous venues. Swift performed it while serving as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. She also performed it as part of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour (2009\u201310). The single was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), indicating more than 2 million units sold in the US.\nTaylor Swift and Liz Rose wrote \"Tim McGraw\" during Swift's freshman year at Hendersonville High School. She conceived the idea in the midst of her mathematics class: \"I was just sitting there, and I started humming this melody.\" She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment. Swift knew that she and her senior boyfriend would break up at the end of the year when he left for college. In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music, \"with the idea and the melody, knowing exactly what she wanted.\" She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone. It was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. \"To her surprise, the first thing that came to mind was [her] love of Tim McGraw's music.\" Several personal details were listed for the song. McGraw's mentioning was a reference to Swift's favorite song, \"Can't Tell Me Nothin\" from his 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying, rather than McGraw as a person. The writing process, as with \"Our Song\", took place in approximately twenty minutes, and was executed with the use of a piano.\nSoon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to his newly formed label. Early into the album production, in a meeting where Borchetta and Swift discussed potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed \"Tim McGraw\" for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, \"That's your first single.\" She responded, \"Well.

Swift wrote \"Our Song\" for a high school talent show during her freshman year; the lyrics are about a young couple using the regular events in their lives to create their own song. She persuaded Big Machine Records to include the song on her debut album because it was popular among her classmates. It was released on September 10, 2007, by Big Machine Records as the album's third single. Produced by Nathan Chapman, \"Our Song\" is an uptempo banjo-driven country track incorporating fiddles and hip hop-influenced drums.\nMusic critics lauded \"Our Song\" for Swift's songwriting craftsmanship resulting in a memorable hook that appeals to a non-country audience. The song featured on Rolling Stone's 2019 list of the best country songs by female artists since 2000. A success on country radio, the single made Swift the youngest person\u2014eighteen at the time\u2014to single-handedly write and sing a number-one single on the Hot Country Songs chart; it stayed at number one for six weeks. \"Our Song\" peaked at number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also peaked at number thirty on the Canadian Hot 100 and was certified platinum by Music Canada (MC).\nTrey Fanjoy directed the song's music video, which premiered on CMT on September 14, 2007. The video won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year at the 2008 CMT Music Awards. To promote her debut album, Swift performed the song on many television programs and at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards. She included \"Our Song\" in the set list of the Fearless Tour (2009\u20132010), her first headlining tour, and performed it on select dates of her subsequent tours including the Speak Now World Tour (2011\u20132012), the Red Tour (2013\u20132014), and the Reputation Stadium Tour (2018).\nPennsylvania-born Taylor Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at fourteen years old, in 2004, to pursue a career in country music. She signed with Sony/ATV in 2004 to become a professional songwriter, and with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country music singer. During a four-month period near the end of 2005, Swift recorded songs for her self-titled debut album with producer Nathan Chapman. By the time production wrapped, Swift had completed her freshman high school year in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The album was released on October 24, 2006, through Big Machine Records.\nSwift wrote and co-wrote all of the album's eleven tracks, including three solely written by herself. Among the three songs, \"Our Song\" is a track Swift wrote for a talent show of her freshman high school year. She conceived the song as an upbeat and relatable track to appeal to her classmates, writing it within twenty minutes. On the inspiration, Swift said: \"I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one.\" Upon receiving positive feedback from her classmates, Swift thought that \"Our Song\" had potentials to become a chart success, insisting that Big Machine Records executives include it on the final track list. She envisioned the production in hear head before approaching Chapman. Swift chose the song as the closing track on the album because the final chorus features the repeated lyric \"Play it again\", which she thought would subliminally suggest the listener replay the album.\nBig Machine Records executives chose \"Our Song\" as the third single from the album, which Swift was surprised yet glad about. The label released the song to US country radio on September 10, 2007, and as a crossover single to US pop radio on March 10, 2008, in partnership with Republic Records. \"Our Song\" was later included on the track list of the international version of Fearless, Swift's second studio album, released in March 2009. In October 2019, following the Taylor Swift masters controversy, Big Machine Records re-released \"Our Song\", along with other singles from Swift's debut album, on limited-edition vinyl.\nNarrated in first person, \"Our Song\" recalls the little moments of a young couple. The lyrics are conversational and simple, which brings forth an engaging and straightforward story line. In the first verse, the narrator and her boyfriend"

Blake Shelton was originally set to record the song, but when Lambert heard it, she emotionally reacted to the lyrics, and immediately  wanted to record it for herself. It was released in March 2010 as the third single from her third studio album, Revolution. It is the fastest-rising single of her career, reaching the Top 20 in its eighth week. For the chart week of June 12, 2010, the song became Lambert's first number one hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, and held its place at the top for four consecutive weeks. It is also Lambert's first single of her career that she did not have a hand in writing. Additionally, it was her second single to receive a platinum certification from the RIAA on January 31, 2011.\nLambert performed the song during the 2010 Academy of Country Music Awards on April 18, 2010, and received a standing ovation. At the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards on February 13, 2011, she won the Grammy for Best Female Country Vocal Performance.\n\"The House That Built Me\" is a country ballad in the key of F major driven primarily by acoustic guitar with steel guitar fills. The song's female narrator describes returning, as an adult, to the house that she grew up in, and asking the person who now lives in the house if she could step inside and take a look around. She refers to it as \"the house that built [her],\" because of all the memories that she had of growing up within its walls.\nAllen Shamblin based the song on his experiences going back to the house in Huffman, Texas that he grew up in at least once a year.\nThe song received critical acclaim. Matt Bjorke described the song favorably in his review of Revolution, referring it as \"one of the absolute best songs on the record.\" He notes that while it could've been \"a bombastic, overdone song,\" Lambert and her producers kept it \"earthy and just downright beautiful.\" Bjorke later reviewed the single itself, describing it as a \"song that plays on the country clich\u00e9 of nostalgia without ever feeling clich\u00e9\" and concluded that it stands a good chance of nomination in the 2010 CMA Awards. Blake Boldt of Engine 145 gave the song a thumbs up, favoring Lambert's preference in \"organic storytelling instead of contrived commercial jingles.\" He described the song itself as \"a gorgeous piece of melancholy country without getting squishy or sentimental\" and called it an \"early favorite for single of the year.\" Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song an A rating, describing it favorably as \"the best on the album\" and a standout for radio, because of \"its grace and intelligence, not because it happens to be more disposably catchy than the others surrounding it.\"\n\"The House That Built Me\" was ranked No. 1 on Engine 145's Best Country Songs of 2009. The song received nominations in three categories (Single of the Year, Song of the Year, and Music Video of the Year) at the 2010 CMA Awards.\n\"The House That Built Me\" debuted at number 51 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of March 6, 2010. It also debuted at number 98 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of April 10, 2010, and at number 91 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart for the week of May 1, 2010; overall, it has become her most successful single on both of these charts. It is Lambert's fastest-rising single to date, and for the chart week of June 12, 2010, the song became her first number-one hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.  It reached its 2 million sales mark in the US by April 2014. As of May 2016, the song has sold 2.267 million copies in the US.\nThe music video, which was directed by Trey Fanjoy, premiered on CMT on April 8, 2010. In the video, Lambert's tour bus pulls up to her childhood home, and she walks up to the front door to ask if she could come in. Inside the house, she wanders through the various rooms, while documentary flashbacks of her family and herself as a child in a house that looks nearly identical to the one in the video, are mixed in. Throughout the video, Lambert is shown performing with her acoustic guitar, seated on the floor in one of the bedrooms. Some of the footage used for the flashbacks consists of Lambert's own home videos. The video was filmed at a house just outside Nashville.\nLambert told The Boot that the concept of the video was clear: \"This was one of those videos that needed to"

It was written by Swift and Liz Rose, and produced by Nathan Chapman, and was released on June 19, 2006 by Big Machine Records as the lead single from Swift's self-titled debut album. She wrote \"Tim McGraw\" during her freshman year of high school, knowing that she and her senior boyfriend would break up at the end of the year when he left for college. The song was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together once he departed, such as the songs by Tim McGraw, one of Swift's favorite county artists. \"Tim McGraw\" blends traditional and modern country music.\n\"Tim McGraw\" performed well commercially. The track spent various weeks on both the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs; it peaked at number 40 on the former and number six on the latter. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold more than one million copies since its release. The accompanying music video for \"Tim McGraw\", directed by Trey Fanjoy, comprises flashbacks by Swift's love interest, among cut scenes that feature Swift lying on a lake bed. \"Tim McGraw\" was promoted by Swift on a radio tour and performances in numerous venues. Swift performed it while serving as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. She also performed it as part of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour (2009\u201310). The single was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), indicating more than 2 million units sold in the US.\nTaylor Swift and Liz Rose wrote \"Tim McGraw\" during Swift's freshman year at Hendersonville High School. She conceived the idea in the midst of her mathematics class: \"I was just sitting there, and I started humming this melody.\" She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment. Swift knew that she and her senior boyfriend would break up at the end of the year when he left for college. In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music, \"with the idea and the melody, knowing exactly what she wanted.\" She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone. It was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. \"To her surprise, the first thing that came to mind was [her] love of Tim McGraw's music.\" Several personal details were listed for the song. McGraw's mentioning was a reference to Swift's favorite song, \"Can't Tell Me Nothin\" from his 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying, rather than McGraw as a person. The writing process, as with \"Our Song\", took place in approximately twenty minutes, and was executed with the use of a piano.\nSoon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to his newly formed label. Early into the album production, in a meeting where Borchetta and Swift discussed potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed \"Tim McGraw\" for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, \"That's your first single.\" She responded, \"Well. That's how that works then.\" Prior to that event, Swift did not believe that the song was single material. However, she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct. Swift placed \"Tim McGraw\" as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her. The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19, 2006. In retrospect, Swift has said that the song \"is reminiscent, and it is thinking about a relationship you had and then lost. I think one of the most powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn't... That was a really good song to start out on, because a lot of people can relate to wanting something you can't have.\" When the song's subject discovered it, he thought it was \"cool\" and kept friendship with Swift despite their breakup.\n\"Tim McGraw\" is a country song with a length of three minutes and 52 seconds. The song mingles traditional and modern country music features, primarily through its usage of a twelve-string guitar. It is categorized as a ballad with a mid-paced nature. Written in the key of C major, the song makes heavy use of the"

That's the truth.\" As for the album, Daigle says, \"I want this to be such a record of joy, such a record of hope, that people experience a childlikeness again. In the time of making this record, I had to remember who I was as a child. I want people to reflect on, 'The innocence of my childhood \u2026 how do I see myself through those eyes again? How do I love myself like that again? Where's that joy? Where's that hope?'\"\n\"You Say\" is originally in the key of F major, with a tempo of 74 beats per minute. Written in common time, the song is based around a chord progression of F-Am\u2013Dm\u2013B\u266d.

It is the fifth track on their 1993 album, Zooropa, and was released as the album's third single on 22 November 1993. The song reached number one in Ireland and reached the top 10 in Australia, Iceland, the United Kingdom, and several other countries. The music video was shot in Berlin, Germany. The earliest incarnation of the song developed during sessions for the group's 1991 album Achtung Baby. It was written for and inspired by Frank Sinatra and bore his surname as the original working title. An alternative recording was used in the Wim Wenders film Faraway, So Close!.\n\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\" was well received by critics and nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song. The song made its live debut on the Zoo TV Tour but has only been performed intermittently in an acoustic version over subsequent tours. Members of U2 consider it to be one of their favourite songs; guitarist The Edge named it the best track on the album, while lead singer Bono stated that it was one of their best creations.\nThe earliest incarnation of \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\" was developed during the recording sessions for Achtung Baby. While working in Hansa Ton Studios in Berlin, guitarist The Edge and lead singer Bono created the verse. The track was given the working title \"Sinatra\" in reference to the artist whose music inspired it. The group reworked it in preparation of Zooropa. The Edge noted \"it came to us in installments\". Bassist Adam Clayton said \"it was hard to figure out how we would do it. I mean, no one is going to mistake us for Frank Sinatra's backing band. A very humble little combo sound is what we ended up with and that really worked.\" The Edge added \"I was playing around on piano with some old-school chord progressions trying to summon up the spirit of Frank Sinatra. It's definitely not from a rock and roll tradition.\" He worked out a chord progression based on old Tin Pan Alley songs.\nAs the recording sessions progressed, Wim Wenders approached the band and asked them for a song for his next film, Faraway, So Close!. The Edge said \"we heard Wim Wenders was looking for a song... so I had a go at finishing it.\" U2 watched the film, Faraway, So Close!, for inspiration on how to craft the song. Bono said \"the film was about angels who want to be human and who want to be on Earth. But to do so they have to become mortal. That was a great image to play with\u00a0- the impossibility of wanting something like this, and then the cost of having it.\" Two versions of the song were crafted; the first was released on Zooropa, and the second, almost two minutes longer and featuring \"an edgier guitar and drum performance,\" was included on the Faraway, So Close! soundtrack. Close to the completion of the recording Bono renamed the song \"Stay.\" Wanting to further reference the Wenders film he then changed it once more, to \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\".\n\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\" runs for 4 minutes and 58 seconds. According to Universal Music Publishing Group's sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is played in common time at a tempo of 86 beats per minute in the key of E\u266d major. The vocals extend from a low note of Bb\u2082 to a high of Bb\u2084., which is one of the highest notes he has ever recorded on studio.\nThird Way contributor Graham Cray wrote that the song \"[describes] more directly a culture which consists of a cacophony of voices and images but which has neither soul nor direction.\" Hot Press editor Niall Stokes noted that the lyrics were ambiguous in whether they took place in reality or fantasy, which he likened to the overarching theme of the album. Author David Kootnikoff believed that \"the pop melody conceals the lyric's dark theme about a victim of physical abuse who reasons her pain away with the line 'When he hurts you, you feel alive.'\" Mark Brown of The Orange County Register described it as \"the desperate tale of an abused woman with nowhere to go but back to her home.\" He compared it to U2's 1987 song \"Running to Stand Still\", saying \"That same sort of descriptive but distanced narrative is what made [it] so powerful.\"\n\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\" was released internationally as the third single from Zooropa on 22 November 1993, following the releases of \"Numb\" and \"Lemon\" earlier in the year. It was available in 7-inch vinyl, cassette, and CD formats in four versions. Various promotional singles were also"

It was released as the eighth single from T.I.'s sixth studio album, Paper Trail (2008). Due to the high number of digital downloads upon the album's release, the song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 before its official single release. The song marked the second collaboration between T.I. and Justin Timberlake, the first being the hit single \"My Love\", from Timberlake's second album, FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006).\nT.I. and Timberlake performed this song at the 51st Grammy Awards. The song was later nominated twice at the 52nd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Rap Song. It was the 10th bestselling digital single of 2009 in the United States. As of early February 2018, it had sold 3.5 million copies in the country.\nRob Knox, one of the song's producers, expressed his feelings about creating the song:\nWe were like, this guy's going through a lot with his whole court case situation and his best friend dyin', and everything in the world kind of crumbling in front of him in a way. We [agreed that] it would be real cool and unexpected to give people something a little more heartfelt \u2013 not the club, party, typical record that everybody wanted. We even had a feeling that T.I. was gonna mention that, but we already had a plan for him.\n\"Dead and Gone\" is a hip hop beat. In the song, T.I. deals with the death of his best friend and former bodyguard, Philant Johnson, who was killed on May 3, 2006, when T.I.'s crew was caught up in a shooting after a show in Cincinnati that left three injured and Johnson dead. The lyrics include lines such as: \"Whoever thought I'd never see Philant no more,\" and \"Big Phil this is for you.\" Johnson's tombstone is shown in the video.\nThere are two radio edits. One with the intro and outro cut off, and the explicit words being censored. Another edit, had cut the intro, the first chorus from Justin Timberlake, and the outro of the song, as well as replaced explicit words with less-offensive words. \"Dead And Gone\" is set in common time with a tempo of 84 beats per minute and is set in the key of A minor, with a chord sequence of Am-C-G-F-E.\nThe song was first confirmed as the next single by co-producer Rob Knox. T.I. later confirmed the release of the single himself. Song was first made available to digital download on September 29, 2008. It was sent to US rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on January 12, 2009. On March 26, 2009 12-inch vinyl was released.\nSputnikmusic was extremely positive in its review: \"You can't help but not skip the track. \"Dead and Gone\", yet another Timberlake / T.I. track is bolstered by its impressive Timbaland beat [although he is not the producer of the song] and the fact that it ends the album on a very, very strong note.\"\nBefore the single was announced, the track debuted at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 due to high downloads. Following its official release as a single, the song made a re-entry on the chart at number 99 and was able to reach #2, though it was not able to succeed Flo Rida's hit single \"Right Round\" from the top spot for five consecutive weeks. After reaching its peak, the following week it fell to the number four position and then to number 6. It is T.I.'s fourth consecutive top 5 hit on the Hot 100 from Paper Trail, and seventh of his career as a lead artist. On the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Billboard sub-chart it also reached #2. The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks and the Hot 100 Airplay chart on the week of March 14, 2009. It also peaked at #9 on the Billboard Pop 100 Airplay chart and #3 on the Billboard Pop 100 chart. It was the 10th best-selling digital single of 2009 in the United States.\nIn the United Kingdom, the song made a strong debut at #30 on the UK Singles Chart, and the following week climbed to #17 and peaked at #4. In Canada it debuted at #59 on the Canadian Hot 100 the same week it did as in the U.S., and after its physical release it made a re-entry at #70 and has now peaked at #3. As of February 2018, the song has sold 3.5 million copies in the US.\nThe video was directed by Chris Robinson and was filmed in the first week of February in Lancaster, California. It surfaced on the internet a few hours before the official release date on February 17. In it, T.I. is filmed driving through a desert landscape,"

As of early February 2018, it had sold 3.5 million copies in the country.\nRob Knox, one of the song's producers, expressed his feelings about creating the song:\nWe were like, this guy's going through a lot with his whole court case situation and his best friend dyin', and everything in the world kind of crumbling in front of him in a way. We [agreed that] it would be real cool and unexpected to give people something a little more heartfelt \u2013 not the club, party, typical record that everybody wanted. We even had a feeling that T.I. was gonna mention that, but we already had a plan for him.\n\"Dead and Gone\" is a hip hop beat. In the song, T.I. deals with the death of his best friend and former bodyguard, Philant Johnson, who was killed on May 3, 2006, when T.I.'s crew was caught up in a shooting after a show in Cincinnati that left three injured and Johnson dead. The lyrics include lines such as: \"Whoever thought I'd never see Philant no more,\" and \"Big Phil this is for you.\" Johnson's tombstone is shown in the video.\nThere are two radio edits. One with the intro and outro cut off, and the explicit words being censored. Another edit, had cut the intro, the first chorus from Justin Timberlake, and the outro of the song, as well as replaced explicit words with less-offensive words. \"Dead And Gone\" is set in common time with a tempo of 84 beats per minute and is set in the key of A minor, with a chord sequence of Am-C-G-F-E.\nThe song was first confirmed as the next single by co-producer Rob Knox. T.I. later confirmed the release of the single himself. Song was first made available to digital download on September 29, 2008. It was sent to US rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on January 12, 2009. On March 26, 2009 12-inch vinyl was released.\nSputnikmusic was extremely positive in its review: \"You can't help but not skip the track. \"Dead and Gone\", yet another Timberlake / T.I. track is bolstered by its impressive Timbaland beat [although he is not the producer of the song] and the fact that it ends the album on a very, very strong note.\"\nBefore the single was announced, the track debuted at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 due to high downloads. Following its official release as a single, the song made a re-entry on the chart at number 99 and was able to reach #2, though it was not able to succeed Flo Rida's hit single \"Right Round\" from the top spot for five consecutive weeks. After reaching its peak, the following week it fell to the number four position and then to number 6. It is T.I.'s fourth consecutive top 5 hit on the Hot 100 from Paper Trail, and seventh of his career as a lead artist. On the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Billboard sub-chart it also reached #2. The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks and the Hot 100 Airplay chart on the week of March 14, 2009. It also peaked at #9 on the Billboard Pop 100 Airplay chart and #3 on the Billboard Pop 100 chart. It was the 10th best-selling digital single of 2009 in the United States.\nIn the United Kingdom, the song made a strong debut at #30 on the UK Singles Chart, and the following week climbed to #17 and peaked at #4. In Canada it debuted at #59 on the Canadian Hot 100 the same week it did as in the U.S., and after its physical release it made a re-entry at #70 and has now peaked at #3. As of February 2018, the song has sold 3.5 million copies in the US.\nThe video was directed by Chris Robinson and was filmed in the first week of February in Lancaster, California. It surfaced on the internet a few hours before the official release date on February 17. In it, T.I. is filmed driving through a desert landscape,"

The song was produced by Dupri and Cox for Usher's fourth studio album, Confessions (2004).  Originally planned as the album's lead single, \"Burn\" was pushed back after favorable responses for the song \"Yeah!\". \"Burn\" was released as the second single from the album on March 21, 2004.\n\"Burn\" topped various charts around the world, including the Billboard Hot 100 for eight non-consecutive weeks; it succeeded \"Yeah!\" at number one.  Both singles gave Usher nineteen consecutive weeks at the top spot, longer than any solo artist of the Hot 100 era. \"Burn\" was certified platinum in Australia and United States, and gold in New Zealand. The song was well received by critics and garnered award nominations. In 2009 it was named the 21st most successful song of the 2000s, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. This song won the 2005 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Song.\nWhen Usher planned to make a new record after his third album, 8701 (2001), he decided to not branch out much with collaborators and continue building music with his previous producers. Usher again enlisted record-producer Jermaine Dupri, who had collaborated on his two previous albums, along with The Neptunes and R. Kelly, among others, to work on his fourth studio album, Confessions (2004). Dupri contacted his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox, who had also made hits like the 2001 single \"U Got It Bad\" for Usher. During an early session for the album, Dupri and Cox talked about a situation which later became \"Burn\". At that time, Usher's two-year relationship with TLC's Chilli was flaming out. They said, \"Yo, you gotta let that burn\u00a0... That's a song right there\", and started writing.\nUsher submitted the album to his label Arista Records after he felt it was completed. After he and the company's then-president Antonio \"LA\" Reid listened to the songs, they felt the album needed a first single and that they needed to create one or two more songs, which caused the album's release to be postponed. Usher went back to the studio and collaborated with Lil Jon, who said, \"He needed a single. They had 'Burn,' 'Burn' was hot, but they needed that first powerful monster. That's when I came in.\" They worked on few more tracks, including \"Red Light\", which was not included in the first release of the album, and \"Yeah!\", which features Ludacris and Lil Jon.\nLabel personnel were undecided as to what to consider as the lead single. Reid was considering whether \"Yeah!\" would be released then, being as they also had \"Burn\". Usher was doubtful if the former was the right choice, after he wanted an R&B record. Until \"Yeah!\" was leaked, \"Burn\" was chosen as the official first single from Confessions. \"Yeah!\", which was intended as a promotional song and a teaser for Usher's fans, was released to street DJs and mixtapes. However, the favorable response to the song led to a change; \"Yeah!\" was the lead single and \"Burn\" was set as its follow-up. \"Burn\" was released in the United States on March 21, 2004, as a CD single, digital download, and 7-inch single. In the United Kingdom, a CD and 12-inch single were issued on June 28, 2004.\nUsher decided about the new material \"to let it all hang out by singing about some of his own little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets.\" The public speculated that  he was referring to his recent personal struggles, on which he promised a \"real talk\".\nIn early 2004, Usher broke up with Chilli due to \"irreconcilable differences and because they found it almost impossible to make compromises.\" Usher said in an interview: \"It's unfortunate when you have to let a situation go because it's not working\", which added reference to the breakup. It was later revealed that Chilli in fact broke up with Usher because of cheating, and the media said otherwise because of the lyrics in the song, which was not based on their relationship. Dupri, however, confessed that his personal life is the real story of the album. Usher said he took inspiration collectively by looking at his friends' personal situations.\n\"Burn\" is a slow jam  R&B ballad. The song is performed with a moderate groove. It is composed in the key of D-flat major. The melody line of the song has influences from \"Ignition (Remix)\" by R. Kelly. \"Burn\" has a combination of robotic noises, synthesized strings and guitar lines.\nThe lyrics are constructed in the traditional verse-chorus form. The song starts with a spoken intro, giving way to the first"

It was produced by Jay Dee and features keyboards performed by James Poyser. It samples \"Open Your Eyes\" as performed by Bobby Caldwell and the drums from \"You're Gettin' a Little Too Smart\" by The Detroit Emeralds. Framed as a love letter, it is a confession of Common's love for a woman \u2013 specifically, his girlfriend at the time, Erykah Badu (in 2012, Common acknowledged via a video for the website RapGenius that the song was about her). Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters describes it as a \"charming, tender, and undeniably soulful declaration of affection and respect.\" A music video (directed by Nzingha Stewart) features Common, Erykah Badu and \"recognizable sensual delights\" including \"a homemade Minnie Riperton cassette, a mango, a pink lava lamp [and] a deeply green water-beaded leaf.\"\nThe song was listed at number 268 on Pitchfork Media's \"Top 500 songs of the 2000s\".\n\nAfter the release of Like Water for Chocolate, the song almost immediately attained the status of one of hip hop's few \"precious\" love songs and women's anthems. It also reached Common's best chart positions: #44 on The Billboard Hot 100, #21 on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart and #12 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. Additionally, it reached #13 on the Hot Rap Singles chart, a feat that Common had previously surpassed.

The song was written by Maurizio Bassi and Naimy Hackett, and released in 1985 as the lead single from Baltimora's debut album Living in the Background. The song was re-recorded and released in 1993, and has been covered by several artists throughout the years.\nThe refrain uses Tarzan's cry as a melodic line. The song is rhythmical, with an electronic melody and simple lyrics. Baltimora are often considered a one-hit wonder due to the success they experienced with \"Tarzan Boy\". It features what was later named the millennial whoop.\nThe music video for the song does not feature either Bassi or Hackett. Instead it features the front man for the band's performances, Jimmy McShane, who did not actually sing the song but rather lip synced it.\nThe song is currently used by Jungle Boy, a wrestler for AEW (All Elite Wrestling), as his entrance music.\n\"Tarzan Boy\" was an international hit, debuting in the top five Italian charts and performing well in several other European countries, including Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, and notably, France, where \"Tarzan Boy\" was most successful, topping the charts there for five consecutive weeks. In the United Kingdom, it reached number 3 in September 1985. The single had success in the United States (where it was released by EMI), with the single remaining on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six months and ultimately peaking at number 13 in early 1986.\nThe single \"Tarzan Boy\" bounced back into the Billboard Hot 100 chart in March 1993 as a remix, climbing to No. 51, at the time of its appearance in a Listerine commercial. The song was also featured in the films Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993), Beverly Hills Ninja (1997) and was then referenced in A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014).\n\n7\" single\n\"Tarzan Boy\" \u2013 3:48\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (DJ version) \u2013 3:36\n12\" single\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended version) \u2013 6:15\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (DJ version) \u2013 5:09\n12\" maxi\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dance version) \u2013 6:16\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (single version) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub version) \u2013 5:10\n12\" maxi \u2013 Summer version\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (Summer version) \u2013 6:40\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (reprise) \u2013 6:00\nCD single\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\n12\" single\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (UK swing mix) \u2013 3:18\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub) \u2013 5:10\nCD maxi\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended 1993 remix) \u2013 5:33\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub mix) \u2013 5:10\nCassette\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\nCD maxi \u2013 Promo\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:45\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:46\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended 1993 remix) \u2013 5:35\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (UK swing mix) \u2013 3:21\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub) \u2013 5:01\nStreaming single\n\"Tarzan Boy\" (Digital Remaster) \u2013 3:49\n\n\n\n\nIn 1989, the Hindi song \"Aaya Mausam Dosti Ka\", from the Bollywood soundtrack for the film Maine Pyar Kiya was heavily influenced by \"Tarzan Boy\".\nIn 2006, the song was covered by Bango, and achieved a minor success, peaking at number 37 in France.\nIn 2008, a cover by Bad Influence featuring Dyce reached number 9 in Sweden.\nList of Dutch Top 40 number-one singles of 1985\nList of European number-one hits of 1985\nList of number-one singles of 1985 (France)\nList of number-one singles of 1985 (Spain)\nEddy, Chuck (8 July 2013). \"Disco 101: Real '80S Italo\".

It was released as the third single from Tragic Kingdom in the United States on April 15, 1996, by Interscope Records. Lead singer Gwen Stefani and her brother Eric Stefani, former No Doubt member, wrote the song originally as a love song. The song went through several rewrites and new versions. Gwen modified it into a breakup song about her bandmate and ex-boyfriend Tony Kanal, shortly after he ended their seven-year relationship.\nDespite the song's popularity, \"Don't Speak\" did not chart on the US Billboard Hot 100 (as rules of the times required commercial singles for charting and one was not issued for the song), but it did reach number one on the Hot 100 Airplay chart for 16 weeks. Outside the United States, it topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, becoming No Doubt's most successful international single. \"Don't Speak\" was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 40th Grammy Awards.\n\"Don't Speak\" was ranked at number 495 on Blender magazine's \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\". The song is a playable track in the 2009 video game Band Hero, and is also included as a downloadable song in 2008's Rock Band 2. The song has been sampled by multiple hip hop artists, including in Rakim's song \"Dedicated\" and Ice Cube's \"War & Peace\".\n\"Don't Speak\" was written by lead singer Gwen Stefani and her brother Eric Stefani, and produced by Matthew Wilder. Originally a love song, Stefani rewrote the lyrics almost completely after her breakup with the band's bass player Tony Kanal. According to her, \"It used to be more upbeat, more of a Seventies rock-type thing. [When] Tony and I broke up... it turned into a sad song.\" A live version that exists from April 1994 shows off a bouncy tune that has the same skeleton as the released version, but not the same urgency. The band performed part of the original song on VH1 Storytellers on August 10, 2000.\n\nThe band's lead guitarist Tom Dumont said about the song's composition: \n There's a lot of stories about that song, because that one unfolded over a longer period of time. Originally, Gwen's brother wrote most of that song, and then after we got at it as a band, Gwen changed the lyrics around to fit her life. Musically, we brought it to another level, but near the end we reworded it. There's an earlier version of the song where the verses are totally different, which is a really beautiful version and it's awesome but it's way more jazzy and really different. That song had a long incubation process.\n\"Don't Speak\" is composed in the key of C minor and F minor. A demo version also appeared on a demo CD, which was presented to Interscope Records prior to the release of Tragic Kingdom.\nUpon release, \"Don't Speak\" immediately began to receive extensive airplay and it eventually became the most widely played song on American radio in 1996. It reached number one on Billboard's Hot 100 Airplay chart and maintained that position for 16 non-consecutive weeks, a record at the time. Although the record would be broken in 1998 by the Goo Goo Dolls's single \"Iris\" with 18 weeks at number one, and again in 2020 by The Weeknd's single Blinding Lights with 20 weeks at number one, the song remains in third place of songs with the most weeks at number one on the Hot 100 Airplay. For all its airplay though, \"Don't Speak\" was not allowed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 as no commercial single was released for it in the United States (a requirement for charting purposes at the time). Slate magazine music critic Chris Molanphy has stated that if the song had been eligible to chart, it almost certainly would have claimed the number one spot.\n\"Don't Speak\" also stayed at number two on Alternative Airplay chart for five consecutive weeks, blocked by the band Bush's single \"Swallowed\". The song also proved to be a crossover hit, reaching number one on the Adult Top 40 chart for 15 consecutive weeks as well as numbers six and nine on the Adult Contemporary and Rhythmic charts, respectively. It was ultimately placed at number one on the Hot 100 Airplay year-end chart of 1997.\nInternationally, \"Don't Speak\" was also very successful. In February 1997, it peaked at number one in both the United Kingdom and Ireland for three weeks. Elsewhere in Europe,"

Sasha Fierce (2008). Originally titled \"Beautiful Nightmare\", it leaked online in March\u00a02008. The song was written and produced by Beyonc\u00e9, James Scheffer, Wayne Wilkins, and Rico Love. Columbia Records released \"Sweet Dreams\" as the album's sixth single, to mainstream radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists in the United States on June\u00a02, 2009, and elsewhere on July\u00a013. It is an electropop song whose instrumentation includes synthesizers, a keyboard, and snare drums. Beyonc\u00e9 employs slinky vocals to sing the lyrics, which describe a romantic relationship that the female protagonist believes could be a dream.\nMusic critics praised the beats, synthpop sound and Beyonc\u00e9's vocals in \"Sweet Dreams\". Some critics noted that the sliding bassline gave the song a dark quality and resembles the one used in some of Michael Jackson's songs on Thriller (1982). \"Sweet Dreams\" gained popularity for its electro music style, which contrasts her earlier R&B, urban, and funk-tinged releases. The song was nominated for the Viewers Choice Award at the 2010 BET Awards. \"Sweet Dreams\" peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100. Outside of the United States, \"Sweet Dreams\" topped the charts in New Zealand, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in many countries, including Australia, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Ireland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. \"Sweet Dreams\" was certified platinum in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Adria Petty, and was filmed in Brooklyn, New York. It mainly uses a green screen and computer-generated effects, making the clip minimal and performance-based. The video sees Beyonc\u00e9 wearing a golden robot suit designed by French fashion designer Thierry Mugler. Critics described it as high-fashion and noted that she reprised some of the choreography from her 2008 video for \"Single Ladies\". Beyonc\u00e9 promoted the song by performing it live at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards and occasionally during the I Am... World Tour (2009\u201310). \"Sweet Dreams\" was recognized as one of the most performed songs of 2009 at the 27th American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Pop Music Awards. The song was used in a Cryster Geyser Water Japanese advertisement that featured Beyonc\u00e9.\nInitially titled \"Beautiful Nightmare\", \"Sweet Dreams\" became one of the first songs composed for Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles' 2008 double album I Am... Sasha Fierce. Record producer Rico Love regarded writing \"Sweet Dreams\" with Knowles as \"the experience of a lifetime\". When Knowles went to the South Beat Studios in Miami Beach, Florida, she was not prepared to record and had to attend the opening concert of her husband Jay-Z's tour. However, when she heard a demo of the song, she was impressed and wanted to record it immediately.\nKnowles, Wayne Wilkins and Jim Jonsin did some additional writing and produced the song alongside Love at the same studio. Knowles and Love worked on the vocal arrangements; Knowles appreciated Love's background vocals in the hook and retained them. Jim Caruana assisted in recording the music. Love then recorded Knowles' vocals; the recording session lasted for an hour. Lastly, Wilkins mixed the track. \"Sweet Dreams\" appears on the Sasha Fierce disc of I Am... Sasha Fierce as it allowed Knowles to portray her alter ego Sasha Fierce, whom Knowles described as her \"fun, more sensual, more aggressive, more outspoken [...] and more glamorous side\".\n\"Sweet Dreams\" is an electropop song that incorporates elements of rock and old-school funk music. The song is built on undulating electro rhythms and a thumping beat; its groove fits into hip hop phrasing. It is mainly driven by a keyboard and also has guitar, piano, synthesizer, snare drum and bass instrumentation. Many music critics noted that several components of \"Sweet Dreams\" are reminiscent of the songs on Michael Jackson's 1982 album Thriller. James Montgomery of MTV News said that the \"gnarly low end\" sounds like Jackson's song \"Beat It\" (1983). Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that the electronic bassline is"

I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse  (2014), and features rapper Wale. The track was released on June 30, 2014, as the third single from the album. It was written by Wale, Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with production helmed by the latter two. The song contains an interpolation of \"I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair\" written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez, both of whom received songwriting credits as a result. The single's artwork caused controversy when the media criticised Carey for photoshopping and re-using images of herself. Carey herself later expressed her discontent on the matter, stating that she had no knowledge of the single's artwork until it was released.\nA disco revival song, the lyrics are about Carey being dissatisfied by her lover's failed attempts at romancing her. Despite being serviced to urban and rhythmic radio in the United States; Belgium, Russia and South Korea were the only territories where the song charted, peaking at number 14 on its Ultratip chart in the Wallonian region, and numbers 73 and 152 in South Korea and Russia, respectively. \"You Don't Know What to Do\" garnered critical acclaim amongst music critics: many complimented the disco revival and throwback style, calling it the best track on the album, and compared it to the works of Jocelyn Brown, Daft Punk, Chic and post-revivalist songs produced Pharrell Williams. Carey and Wale performed the song for the first time on the Today show in the United States.\n\"You Don't Know What to Do\" was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with featured artist Wale. The song interpolates a song called \"I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair\", written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by Inner Life in 1979. Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result. In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed to be Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, before the singer became pregnant with twins in 2010, and then resumed working on the project after she gave birth in 2011. \"She was committed to making it before she got pregnant. Then she got pregnant and she took the time off. Then after she came back, we started really vibing again and we picked up right where we left off. I just feel like between Jermaine, myself and her, we came up with a few things that [are] really, really a solid body of work\".\nIn August 2013, Wale revealed that he had been in the studio with Carey, posting the message \"Mariah x Wale x JD = coming soon\" on his Twitter account. Then, on May 16, 2014, Carey and Wale premiered their collaboration, revealed to be called \"You Don't Know What to Do\", live during a mini-concert for Today held by Carey. Following the performance, Carey premiered the studio version on May 19 on The Russ Parr Morning Show radio show. A solo version which omits Wale's rap verses was later released in June 2014. The song was serviced to urban contemporary radio on June 30, 2014 and rhythmic contemporary radio on July 1, 2014, as the third single to be released from the album.\nWhen Carey released \"You Don't Know What to Do\" as single fans noticed that its accompanying single artwork looked odd. It was later revealed that the single artwork was a cropped version of the album cover for Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, whereby her head  had been swapped for another image in favor of one which was forward-facing, as well as an edited background. Various media outlets criticized Carey for continuing to heavily airbrush and \"recycle\" images of herself. In response, Carey expressed her discontent on Twitter, stating she had nothing to do with the selection of the single's artwork and in turn asked for fans to send in their artwork designs as alternatives, ending the message with \"'cause at this point IDKWTD!\", an abbreviation of the song's title.\n\"You Don't Know What to Do\" is a disco revival song with elements of gospel, pop and R&B styles. It lasts for a duration of four minutes and 46 seconds."

Sasha Fierce (2008). It was written by Knowles, Angela Beyinc\u00e9, Solange Knowles and the Bama Boyz and produced by the Bama Boyz and Knowles. \"Why Don't You Love Me\" is an R&B song with disco influences that is set in a retro style. According to its lyrics, Knowles questions her love interest about why he does not value her fabulousness. Its 1960s-styled music video was directed by Melina Matsoukas and Knowles under the alias Bee-Z, and it stars the latter as \"B.B. Homemaker\". Knowles pays homage to Bettie Page in the video, which critics universally commended for its 1960's style sets and costumes. They also complimented Knowles for her acting skills.\n\"Why Don't You Love Me\" was well received by critics. It topped the United States Hot Dance Club Songs chart for one week in February 2010, a little over one year after the original release of I Am... Sasha Fierce. On August 27, 2010, the song was released as a single in the United Kingdom. It eventually charted at number 51 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 14 on its R&B Singles Chart. Although not being released elsewhere, \"Why Don't You Love Me\" garnered some attention in Australia, where it charted at number 73; it bubbled under the main charts of Belgium and reached number 44 on Slovakia Airplay Chart. In the US, it emerged as the nineteenth most played track in dance clubs in 2010. \"Why Don't You Love Me\" was a part of Knowles' set list for the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, the Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live revue, the Mrs Carter Show World Tour and the On the Run Tour.\n\"Why Don't You Love Me\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Solange Knowles, Angie Beyinc\u00e9 and produced as well as co-written by The Bama Boyz. Jonathan Wells of Bama Boyz said that they decided to try something different from what they usually do, by mixing several genres for \"Why Don't You Love Me\". The song's inspiration came from the time they spent in London at the end of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles' The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience tour in promotion of her second studio album B'Day (2006). The writing and production of the song began in London and was finished stateside in early 2008. They admitted that the song's structure was unusual, however they were happy that it ended up in the Knowles' hands. After The Bama Boyz produced two tracks on Solange Knowles' second studio album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams (2008), she asked them to put instrumentals together for her to write for her sister Beyonc\u00e9.\nThe Bama Boyz almost intentionally left the instrumental for \"Why Don't You Love Me\" out, since they thought that the song did not sound like the tracks Beyonc\u00e9 was recording for her upcoming album, at that particular time. However, Jesse Rankins explained that they later decided to put the instrumental for \"Why Don't You Love Me\" in the email because they knew that Solange likes weird records, but, they made sure to send it last. Out of all the mainstream-inspired attempts The Bama Boyz sent to Solange, she eventually chose that last and most unexpected track and penned \"Why Don't You Love Me\". Jonathan Wells commented: \"When they heard Solange's demo, we were excited because that track was more our true sound than any of the others [sent], but we still kinda didn't believe Beyonc\u00e9 would cut it...but we hoped!\"\nBeyonc\u00e9 came to Houston's Music World Studios for a recording session a few months after Solange had cut the demo. Knowles invited The Bama Boyz into her session at the Houston's Music World Studios to listen to the early versions of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Unexpectedly, after Beyonc\u00e9 played \"Halo\", \"Why Don't You Love Me\" came blasting through the speakers with Knowles singing the song. The Bama Boyz were thrilled that she recorded it and loved the song. According to \"Anti-Music\", the song was nearly discarded twice; the first time was when EMI Music prepared a demo of the song to send to other artists without knowing that Knowles had already recorded the song, and the second came during the"

Sasha Fierce (2008). Originally titled \"Beautiful Nightmare\", it leaked online in March\u00a02008. The song was written and produced by Beyonc\u00e9, James Scheffer, Wayne Wilkins, and Rico Love. Columbia Records released \"Sweet Dreams\" as the album's sixth single, to mainstream radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists in the United States on June\u00a02, 2009, and elsewhere on July\u00a013. It is an electropop song whose instrumentation includes synthesizers, a keyboard, and snare drums. Beyonc\u00e9 employs slinky vocals to sing the lyrics, which describe a romantic relationship that the female protagonist believes could be a dream.\nMusic critics praised the beats, synthpop sound and Beyonc\u00e9's vocals in \"Sweet Dreams\". Some critics noted that the sliding bassline gave the song a dark quality and resembles the one used in some of Michael Jackson's songs on Thriller (1982). \"Sweet Dreams\" gained popularity for its electro music style, which contrasts her earlier R&B, urban, and funk-tinged releases. The song was nominated for the Viewers Choice Award at the 2010 BET Awards. \"Sweet Dreams\" peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100. Outside of the United States, \"Sweet Dreams\" topped the charts in New Zealand, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in many countries, including Australia, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Ireland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. \"Sweet Dreams\" was certified platinum in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Adria Petty, and was filmed in Brooklyn, New York. It mainly uses a green screen and computer-generated effects, making the clip minimal and performance-based. The video sees Beyonc\u00e9 wearing a golden robot suit designed by French fashion designer Thierry Mugler. Critics described it as high-fashion and noted that she reprised some of the choreography from her 2008 video for \"Single Ladies\". Beyonc\u00e9 promoted the song by performing it live at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards and occasionally during the I Am... World Tour (2009\u201310). \"Sweet Dreams\" was recognized as one of the most performed songs of 2009 at the 27th American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Pop Music Awards. The song was used in a Cryster Geyser Water Japanese advertisement that featured Beyonc\u00e9.\nInitially titled \"Beautiful Nightmare\", \"Sweet Dreams\" became one of the first songs composed for Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles' 2008 double album I Am... Sasha Fierce. Record producer Rico Love regarded writing \"Sweet Dreams\" with Knowles as \"the experience of a lifetime\". When Knowles went to the South Beat Studios in Miami Beach, Florida, she was not prepared to record and had to attend the opening concert of her husband Jay-Z's tour. However, when she heard a demo of the song, she was impressed and wanted to record it immediately.\nKnowles, Wayne Wilkins and Jim Jonsin did some additional writing and produced the song alongside Love at the same studio. Knowles and Love worked on the vocal arrangements; Knowles appreciated Love's background vocals in the hook and retained them. Jim Caruana assisted in recording the music. Love then recorded Knowles' vocals; the recording session lasted for an hour. Lastly, Wilkins mixed the track. \"Sweet Dreams\" appears on the Sasha Fierce disc of I Am... Sasha Fierce as it allowed Knowles to portray her alter ego Sasha Fierce, whom Knowles described as her \"fun, more sensual, more aggressive, more outspoken [...] and more glamorous side\".\n\"Sweet Dreams\" is an electropop song that incorporates elements of rock and old-school funk music. The song is built on undulating electro rhythms and a thumping beat; its groove fits into hip hop phrasing. It is mainly driven by a keyboard and also has guitar, piano, synthesizer, snare drum and bass instrumentation. Many music critics noted that several components of \"Sweet Dreams\" are reminiscent of the songs on Michael Jackson's 1982 album Thriller. James Montgomery of MTV News said that the \"gnarly low end\" sounds like Jackson's song \"Beat It\" (1983). Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that the electronic bassline is"

It was first released to digital retailers on 19 October 2015 as the album's third official single before impacting American contemporary hit radio on 3 November 2015, and as the lead single from the reissue. Cowritten by Kelly with the singer-songwriters Hayley Warner, Zac Poor, Lindsey Jackson, and Thom Macken, the song was produced by Adam Anders and Peer \u00c5str\u00f6m. \"Hollow\" has been certified Platinum in Kelly's home country.\nA midtempo ballad, \"Hollow\" has fluttering synthesizers and piano as well as drum and hand-clap percussion in its instrumentation. Lyrically, the song addresses Kelly's faith and has been described as a \"love song to God\". It received a positive response from music critics, who praised the song's uplifting message and Kelly's strong vocals. The accompanying music video for the song was released on 5 November 2015 and it shows Kelly performing the track in an abandoned house.\nWhile promoting her first album and after the moderate impact of the previous singles, \"Nobody Love\" and Should've Been Us\", Kelly wanted to release another single. When she heard a song called \"Hollow\" it was not fully finished, so she went to the studio the same night and finished the song. On 14 October 2015, she announced on her Twitter account that she was going to release a new song called \"Hollow\" the following week. Two days later, she teased the song on Twitter once more, with eleven seconds of the track. It was initially released as a digital download in Europe on 19 October 2015, before being released in North America on 22 October 2015. An official remix featuring the American hip hop artist Big Sean was released to digital retailers on 29 October 2015. Big Sean provides an additional half-sung, half-rapped verse towards the end of the song, replacing an iteration of the chorus from the solo version. \"Hollow\" was serviced to contemporary hit radio on 3 November 2015. It was later confirmed that the song was going to be included on the reissue of Unbreakable Smile as its lead-single (and third overall).\n\"Hollow\" was written by Kelly with the singer-songwriters Hayley Warner, Zac Poor, Lindsey Jackson and Thom Macken, with production by Adam Anders and Peer \u00c5str\u00f6m. It has a duration of three minutes and thirty seconds. The song is a midtempo sentimental pop ballad that incorporates synthesizers, piano and drums in its instrumentation. The song begins with synthesizers and piano \"fluttering\" in the background, emphasizing Kelly's vocals, before building to a more bombastic production style with the inclusion of the drum and hand-clap percussion. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing Company Inc., the song is written in the key of D minor, with a tempo of 126 beats per minute. Kelly's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of a G5 belt and an A5 in head voice. Lyrically, the song describes a hollow life becoming filled with love, which Kelly attributes to her faith, describing \"Hollow\" as her \"love song to God\". Kelly described the song as \"honest\", \"vulnerable\" and \"epic\". In the chorus she sings, \"I'm fragile and you know this/ So hold me, wrap me in love/ Fill up my cup/ Empty, and only your love could fill up my cup/ Because I'm hollow.\"\nThe song received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Robbie Daw of Idolator called it \"a big pop anthem\", noting, \"By the time the second chorus rolls around, it\u2019s pretty clear that the 22 year old and all involved mean business with 'Hollow'.\" Christina Garibaldi of MTV News praised the fact that the song \"once again shows off Tori\u2019s impressive vocals as she smoothly navigates the heavy lyrics over a slow piano\". Garibaldi also praised the incorporation of drums and the intense foot-stomp \"that not only elevates the music, but heightens the emotion\". Carolyn Menyes of Music Times was positive, noting that \"Kelly's always-strong vocals are the main power behind the track, just dripping with vulnerability. As the song builds, snaps, drums and electronic instruments are added to the mix, giving 'Hollow' a filling build, which swells alongside Kelly.\" While noting that the song \"sounds like an emotional entry from her diary\", Scott Shetler of AXS named it \"personal and universal, which should help it connect with listeners\".\nThe official music video for \"Hollow\" was directed by Dano Cerny and"

Keys co-wrote and co-produced the R&B ballad with Jeff Bhasker and Salaam Remi. The song contains an interpolation of the drums from the 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" by American rock guitarist Billy Squier, who received a writing credit on \"Girl on Fire\". Released on September 4, 2012, as the lead single from the album of the same name, \"Girl on Fire\" is Keys' first release under RCA Records following the closure of J Records, after a reorganization at Sony Music Entertainment.\n\"Girl on Fire\" was inspired by Keys' giving birth to her son Egypt and marriage to husband Swizz Beatz. Keys recorded a three-track suite for the song, consisting of the main version in addition to two remixes. The first remix, titled \"Inferno\", adds two new verses from American hip hop artist Nicki Minaj, whilst the second mix titled \"Bluelight\" strips back the drums and piano leaving a sparse bass-led production and re-recorded \"smokey\" vocals. \"Girl on Fire\" opened to extremely positive reviews from critics, with many praising Keys' vocals and the song's production. Keys performed \"Girl on Fire\" for the first time at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards on September 6, 2012, where she was joined by Minaj and American gymnastics gold-medalist Gabby Douglas. The song has been certified 5x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\"Girl on Fire\" is the lead single and title track from Alicia Keys' fifth studio album, Girl on Fire (2012). Alongside the main single, Keys recorded two other versions: the Inferno Remix which features new verses from Nicki Minaj and a Bluelight Remix which strips back the vocals and production from the main single. Gerrick Kennedy from the LA Times spoke of the multiple versions of the song commenting that the main single was most likely made for pop radio, but noted that Minaj's verses on the Inferno Remix would probably get noticed more. On being able to premiere her new song at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, Keys said, \nDebuting a new song at the VMAs is definitely special. I debuted 'No One' at the VMAs\u00a0\u2014 it was the first time anyone in the world heard 'No One,' Keys said. \"It's the perfect setting. It's the right energy. It's the right vibe. People are so excited about the night of music and hearing different styles that it just goes over really well. I can't wait!\n\n\"Girl on Fire\" is a midtempo song written by Keys, Jeff Bhasker, Salaam Remi and American rock guitarist Billy Squier. Squier earns a writing credit for the inclusion of an interpolation of the drums from his 1980 song \"The Big Beat\". Composed on the key of A major, \"Girl on Fire\" uses common time and is set to a \"heavy beat\" at a tempo of 93 beats per minute. Keys' vocals range in the song over an octave from a low note of C\u266f\u2084 up to a high note of E\u2085. On the main single, Keys opens the songs with the lyrics \"She got both feet on the ground and she's burning it down. She got her head in the clouds and she's not backing down. This girl is on fire!\" Keys' lyrics centre around toasting the \"achievements of women everywhere\", particularly with the hook \"She's just a girl and she's on fire\", which according to MTV's Rob Markman is delivered with a \"calming-yet-commanding wail\". Markman also spoke of the pace of the song, describing it as \"pulsating\". LA Time's Gerrick Kennedy expanded further describing the songs components as \"a fierce battlecry over a fast-building simplistic hook\". Critics likened \"Girl on Fire\" to Keys' previous singles \"No One\" (2007) and \"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\" (2009). Throwing \"If I Ain't Got You\" (2004) into the list of comparisons, Erin Thompson from Seattle Weekly said \"Girl on Fire\" compares to previous Keys' ballads with its \"quiet, unassuming verses leading into big, empathic choruses.\"\nThe Inferno version features Nicki Minaj, who wrote and rapped two new verses on the song. Minaj's vocals were recorded at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. The inferno remix uses the same production and sample as the main single however, the first two verses of the song were described as \"understated\" by Carl Williot from Idolator, with Minaj leading the remix with a new rap verse. She raps \"Took me on the balcony, telling me to jump with her/ Yeah I'm in the ghost but I ain't doing stunts with her/ I ain't trying to be that, haters want to see"

Big Sean provides an additional half-sung, half-rapped verse towards the end of the song, replacing an iteration of the chorus from the solo version. \"Hollow\" was serviced to contemporary hit radio on 3 November 2015. It was later confirmed that the song was going to be included on the reissue of Unbreakable Smile as its lead-single (and third overall).\n\"Hollow\" was written by Kelly with the singer-songwriters Hayley Warner, Zac Poor, Lindsey Jackson and Thom Macken, with production by Adam Anders and Peer \u00c5str\u00f6m. It has a duration of three minutes and thirty seconds. The song is a midtempo sentimental pop ballad that incorporates synthesizers, piano and drums in its instrumentation. The song begins with synthesizers and piano \"fluttering\" in the background, emphasizing Kelly's vocals, before building to a more bombastic production style with the inclusion of the drum and hand-clap percussion. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing Company Inc., the song is written in the key of D minor, with a tempo of 126 beats per minute. Kelly's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of a G5 belt and an A5 in head voice. Lyrically, the song describes a hollow life becoming filled with love, which Kelly attributes to her faith, describing \"Hollow\" as her \"love song to God\". Kelly described the song as \"honest\", \"vulnerable\" and \"epic\". In the chorus she sings, \"I'm fragile and you know this/ So hold me, wrap me in love/ Fill up my cup/ Empty, and only your love could fill up my cup/ Because I'm hollow.\"\nThe song received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Robbie Daw of Idolator called it \"a big pop anthem\", noting, \"By the time the second chorus rolls around, it\u2019s pretty clear that the 22 year old and all involved mean business with 'Hollow'.\" Christina Garibaldi of MTV News praised the fact that the song \"once again shows off Tori\u2019s impressive vocals as she smoothly navigates the heavy lyrics over a slow piano\". Garibaldi also praised the incorporation of drums and the intense foot-stomp \"that not only elevates the music, but heightens the emotion\". Carolyn Menyes of Music Times was positive, noting that \"Kelly's always-strong vocals are the main power behind the track, just dripping with vulnerability. As the song builds, snaps, drums and electronic instruments are added to the mix, giving 'Hollow' a filling build, which swells alongside Kelly.\" While noting that the song \"sounds like an emotional entry from her diary\", Scott Shetler of AXS named it \"personal and universal, which should help it connect with listeners\".\nThe official music video for \"Hollow\" was directed by Dano Cerny and"

It served as her debut single, the first from her self-titled debut album (2002). It was written by Ashanti, 7 Aurelius, Etterlene Jordan, Mark DeBarge and Irv Gotti, while production was overseen by Gotti. The song uses a sample of DeBarge's \"Stay with Me\" and features elements from the remix of \"One More Chance\" by The Notorious B.I.G. and \"M.V.P.\" by Big L. Due to the inclusion of the sample, Mark DeBarge and Etterlene Jordan are also credited as songwriters. A promotional version of the single called \"Unfoolish\" features a verse from Notorious B.I.G. from his song \"F--king You Tonight\".\nThe song was released as the album's lead single on January 29, 2002. It spent ten weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming Ashanti's second number one and third top ten on both charts. Elsewhere, \"Foolish\" became a top ten hit in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The song was nominated for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 2003 Grammy Awards, and won the Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Single \u2013 Female. In 2009, Billboard ranked it 19th on its Hot 100 Songs of the 2000s Decade.\nThe song is performed in the key of C major in common time with a tempo of 89 beats per minute.  It follows a chord progression of Fmaj7\u2013G, and Ashanti's vocals span from A\u2083 to C\u2086.\n\"Foolish\" spent 10 consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard charts and a total of 17 weeks in the top 10. It would later get ranked the second best performing single of 2002, and listed as the 132nd best single.\nThe filming session of the video for the single took place during January 2002. It was directed by Irv Gotti. The video shows the viewer a relationship where a man, played by Terrence Howard, gets involved into some criminal acts after telling his girlfriend [Ashanti] that he is in construction and is unfaithful to Ashanti with Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta reality star Althea, which ends up in a break-up after some quarrel. As the song suggests, Ashanti feels that she still loves her ex and that she just can't seem to get over him and becomes frusturated since her heart and her mind force her to love him and hate him at the same time. In supporting roles we can also see Charli Baltimore, Vita, Ja Rule and Irv Gotti. The video is set in the fashion of the movie Goodfellas, with Ashanti in the role of Karen Hill and Terrence Howard in the role of Henry Hill. Irv Gotti and Ja Rule are also in a scene appearing to take the roles of Jimmy Conway and Paulie Cicero. The video was a three-time nominee at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video, Best R&B Video, and Best New Artist.\nEuropean CD single\n\"Foolish\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:52\n\"Foolish\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:52\nAustralian/US Maxi single\n\"Foolish\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:52\n\"Foolish\" (album version) \u2013 3:48\n\"Foolish\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:51\n\"Foolish\" (video)\nUK 5\" CD single\n\"Foolish\" (album version) \u2013 3:48\n\"Unfoolish\" (clean album version) \u2013 3:15\n\"Foolish\" (Topnotch Remix)\n\"Foolish\" (video)\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Ashanti.\nInstrumentation\u00a0\u2013 7 Aurelius\nMixing\u00a0\u2013 Supa Engineer Duro, Irv Gotti\nProduction\u00a0\u2013 7 Aurelius, Irv Gotti\nSongwriting\u00a0\u2013 7 Aurelius, A.

The song was released on September 9, 2011, by RCA Records as the third and final single from the album. \"Wish You Were Here\" was written by Lavigne along with the song's producers Max Martin and Shellback. According to Lavigne, the song shows her vulnerable side. Critical reception toward the song was positive, with critics praising it as a highlight on the album.\nThe accompanying music video for \"Wish You Were Here\" was directed by Dave Meyers and it premiered on September 9, 2011. Lavigne described the video as different from her previous work. Upon its release on the Internet, it received mixed to positive reviews from music critics who praised Lavigne's portrayal of emotions, and described it as dark. She further added \"Wish You Were Here\" to the set list of her tour, The Black Star Tour.\n\"Wish You Were Here\" is written by Lavigne, Max Martin, and Shellback, while produced by the latter two. It was recorded at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. In a telephone interview with The Caprice, Lavigne confirmed that the song would serve as the third and possibly last single from Goodbye Lullaby. During an interview with Artistdirect, Lavigne said that the song showed her vulnerable side.\nIn an interview with MTV News, she stated that the song is the perfect tune for anyone who's not able to be with the ones they love this holiday season. \"I\u2019m excited about 'Wish You Were Here' being the single because it's a ballad and the song kind of represents the album definitely more so than the first single,\" she told MTV News about the song, which she performed during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade last week. \"That was kind of more my older stuff and more pop rock and aggressive and a lighter subject. Goodbye Lullaby, for me, was a record that I was writing for myself.\" Lavigne also described her meeting with Martin and the work on \"Wish You Were Here\":\n\"He said some really kind things that really meant a lot to me. He worked with so many people and he's an artist, he's very sensitive. We wrote a couple really special songs together. It's kind of hard to work with someone new, and when I went in and did vocals on 'Wish You Were Here', I did my first take, and then Max stood up and was like, 'I'm so honored that you're here.' And it was a really special moment, where he understood me and I understood him. We connected and had a really great time. And it was really magic my first trip there.\"\n\"Wish You Were Here\" was described as a midtempo power ballad, while featuring soaring strings, piano and drum kits. The lyrics talk about missing someone and something we all go through in our lives.\nIn an interview with MTV News, Lavigne described the song as the most personal track on the album. \"It was more raw and stripped-down and more emotional and I wasn't holding back,\" she said of working on the album. \"[It's] sort of more song driven and the production was mainly just like a lot of acoustic guitars and loops and just all about the vocal; the vocal being clear and having an honest emotion to it. And saying that, yeah, the first two singles ['What the Hell' and 'Smile'] were more pop rock, and so now finally with this one, 'Wish You Were Here', being released, it feels right.\"\nThe song comes from a place deep inside and is very much about someone in Lavigne's life. \"I love this song. I like this song because I wrote it about missing somebody and that's something that we all go through at some point in our lives,\" she explained. \"It's just about looking back and remembering all those good times you shared with somebody, all the crazy moments. And that's life. We all experience that at some point, but it has a positive message.\"\n\"Wish You Were Here\" received largely positive reviews from critics.  Jody Rosen, writing for Rolling Stone magazine, described \"Wish You Were Here\" as a \"jangling power ballad\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic marked \"Wish You Were Here\" as a highlight of the album, Goodbye Lullaby. Al Fox, an editor of BBC Music, said that the song is one of the tracks from the album where \"Lavigne actually manages to communicate some real sentiment\". He also commented that it is \"an unassuming strum-along\". Bill Lamb of the website About.com found \"interesting arrangements and musical settings\" in the song.

When she heard a song called \"Hollow\" it was not fully finished, so she went to the studio the same night and finished the song. On 14 October 2015, she announced on her Twitter account that she was going to release a new song called \"Hollow\" the following week. Two days later, she teased the song on Twitter once more, with eleven seconds of the track.

It is a dance track built from a guitar riff sampled from the 1981 Chaka Khan song \"Fate\". \"Music Sounds Better with You\" is the only release by Stardust, which comprised Thomas Bangalter from Daft Punk, DJ Alan Braxe, and vocalist Benjamin Diamond.\n\"Music Sounds Better with You\" was initially released on Bangalter's label Roul\u00e9, followed by a wider release on Virgin Records, accompanied by a music video directed by Michel Gondry. It debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart in August 1998 and stayed there for two weeks, becoming one of the UK's bestselling singles that year. It also spent two weeks at the top of the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. It received positive reviews and has been named one of the greatest dance songs of all time by several publications. After the single's release, Stardust disbanded, believing it created \"a certain magic and mystery\".\nIn the mid-1990s, DJ Alan Braxe met Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk and gave him a demo of his track \"Vertigo\"; Bangalter released the track on his label Roul\u00e9 in 1997. After the launch, Braxe performed at the Rex Club in Paris, with Bangalter on keyboards and Braxe's friend Benjamin Diamond on vocals. They composed the first version of \"Music Sounds Better with You\" for the performance, using a looped sample from the 1981 Chaka Khan song \"Fate\", sampled using an E-mu SP-1200.\nAfter the performance, the trio worked on the track at Bangalter's home studio, Daft House. They added a bassline using a Korg Trident synthesiser, drums with a Roland TR-909 drum machine, and Rhodes piano. They assembled the instrumental using an Ensoniq ASR-10 sampling keyboard, triggering different sections by assigning them to different keys. Diamond's vocals and the final track were compressed with an Alesis 3630. \nThe lyrics were written by all three members; the song initially had more lines, which were deleted. Diamond felt the sparse lyrics were \"like a mantra ... something everyone could understand\". Braxe recalled the trio listening to the finished song: \"We were very happy because we felt like we achieved something original and quite new in its form.\"\n\"Music Sounds Better with You\" was released as a vinyl single on Bangalter's label Roul\u00e9 in early 1998. According to Braxe, the song initially confused Paris clubgoers: \"It didn't take a long time for people to understand the structure of the track and start to dance on it, but the very first listen the reaction was, 'What is it?'\"\nThe single was intended for DJs, but demand grew after copies were distributed at the 1998 Miami Winter Music Conference. According to Roul\u00e9 co-manager Gildas Loaec, BBC Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong was the first radio DJ to play it. Loaec and Diamond said Roul\u00e9 sold between 250,000 and 400,000 copies. Bangalter did not enjoy the pressure and attention the single brought, as his label Roul\u00e9 was \"supposed to be a hobby, a creative platform\".\nStardust signed the single to Virgin Records, which sold over two million copies worldwide on vinyl and CD. It topped the charts in Greece and Spain and peaked within the top 10 in at least nine other countries. It has been certified platinum in Australia and the United Kingdom, gold in Belgium and silver in France.

In the video, a young boy builds a model aeroplane while the members of Stardust, wearing metallic suits with faces painted silver, perform on television.

For Insomniac, Jonny Coleman wrote that the video \"helps reinforce the notion that this whole Stardust concept is supposed to exist in some other familiar but foreign liminal space, something ghostly but still warm and inviting\".\nJohn Bush from AllMusic described \"Music Sounds Better with You\" as \"one of the most irresistible, sublime dance singles of the decade\".

It first appeared in its original version on Moloko's second album, I Am Not a Doctor; it was released as a single on 8 March 1999, reaching number 45 on the UK Singles Chart. The song experienced chart success after it was remixed by DJ Boris Dlugosch, peaking at number four in the UK in September 1999. Murphy had started writing the lyrics while clubbing in New York City, and knew the song was at heart a dance track, but the group wanted to record it in a different artistic fashion for its album version.\nTogether with their record company they had commissioned mixes by Todd Terry (who had turned Everything But the Girl's \"Missing\" into an international club anthem). Moloko were not satisfied with the Terry mix and had to convince their label Echo Records to put out the Boris D. version instead. The remixed version was eventually featured on over 100 compilations, and was later added on Moloko's third album, Things to Make and Do, after hitting the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. In 1999 it reached number one on the US dance chart. As a form of barter for the remix, Moloko vocalist R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy later co-wrote and appeared on Boris D.'s \"Never Enough\" single, starring in the video for that release as well.\nScottish newspaper Aberdeen Press and Journal viewed \"Sing It Back\" as a \"Balearic hit\". In her review of the I Am Not a Doctor album, Heather Phares from AllMusic described it as a \"techno torch song\". A reviewer from Daily Record said it is \"their best single since 1996's Fun For Me\". Stevie Chick from NME wrote, \"Roisin Murphy, it must be said, has a remarkable voice, a chalky, skewed howl which can twist into a purr, a cry or a sexy growl. On 'Sing It Back', she's cast as Eartha Kitt, all unquenchable lust, sly, coquettish snarls, a luxuriant, lingering sigh. What a shame it's wasted on some of the limpest, radio-friendly handbag tedium ever put on wax.\"\nThe music video was produced to promote the single, directed by Dawn Shadforth. It features Moloko vocalist R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy dancing alone in a metallic flapper dress, accompanied by psychedelic lighting effects. The video is featured on the DVD of Moloko's special edition for the Statues album. It was later published on Moloko's official YouTube channel in October 2016. The video has amassed more than 16,4 million views as of September 2021. \nSeveral live videos exist as well, including one in the group's live concert movie 11,000 Clicks, a similar concert version from the Dutch Pinkpop broadcast, a televised version from the TV show Later... with Jools Holland, and a samba version featured on MTV Brasil.\nQ Magazine ranked \"Sing It Back\" at number 905 in their list of the 1001 Best Songs Ever in 2002.\nAustralian music channel Max placed it at number 887 in their list of 1000 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2012.\nGerman magazine Musikexpress listed the song as number 449 in their ranking of the 700 Best Songs of All-Time in 2014.\nMixmag put the song in their list of Vocal House: The 30 All-Time Biggest Anthems in 2018.\nTomorrowland featured the song in their Official The Ibiza 500 as high as number 55.\nUK CD1\n\"Sing It Back\" (Tee's Radio) \u2013 3:25\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T Loco Mix) \u2013 5:22\n\"Sing It Back\" (DJ Plankton's Dub) \u2013 8:32\nUK CD2\n\"Sing It Back (Boris Musical Mix Edit) \u2013 4:38\n\"Sing It Back (Herbert's Tasteful Dub) \u2013 5:38\n\"Sing It Back (Tee's Freeze Mix) \u2013 9:02\nBoris Dlugosch mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Musical Mix) \u2013 9:15\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Musical Mix Edit) \u2013 4:37\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Main Instrumental) \u2013 9:19\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Funk Dub) \u2013 6:53\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Reprise) \u2013 8:14\n\"Sing It Back\" (BMR Club Mix) \u2013 7:12\nLevent Canseven mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Levent's Funk-O-Rama Mix) \u2013 7:40\n\"Sing It Back\" (Levent's Funk-O-Rama Dub) \u2013 7:42\n\"Sing It Back\" (Can 7 Supermarket Mix) \u2013 8:20\n\"Sing It Back\" (Can 7 Supermarket Radio) \u2013 4:04\nMousse T. mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Bootleg Dub) \u2013 7:37\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Feel Love Mix) \u2013 7:09\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Feelluvdub) \u2013 7:09\nMatthew Herbert mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Herbert's Evangelista Albertini Acid House Mix) \u2013 6:44\n\"Sing It Back\" (Herbert's Tasteful Dub) \u2013 5:58\nTodd Terry mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mike Penfold paranoia ice Mix) \u2013 9:02\n\"Sing It Back\" (Tee's Radio) \u2013 3:26\nBooker T mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T Loco Mix) \u2013 5:23\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T"

It was released as the lead single from the band's fourth studio album The Great Escape on 14 August 1995. Released on the same day as the Oasis single \"Roll with It\" \u2013 in a chart battle dubbed the \"Battle of Britpop\" \u2013 \"Country House\" reached number one in the UK Singles Chart (the first of two Blur singles to reach number one, the second being 1997's \"Beetlebum\"). The song is the band's best-selling single, with over 540,000 copies sold as of May 2014.\nIn an interview for the South Bank Show, Damon Albarn explained that it was inspired by former Blur manager Dave Balfe, who left Blur's label Food Records and bought a house in the country.\nDavid Balfe moved to The Bury in 1994 at Church End in southern Bedfordshire off the A6. The house had 4 acres of land, nine bedrooms with five ensuite. He moved with his wife Helen and their children aged 2 and 4, when he was 36.\nThe house was advertised in 2015 for \u00a32m. It was Grade 2 listed in February 1975.\nThe song is about a man who retires to an expensive country house to escape the pressures of the city. The cover art features a horizontally-flipped image of Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria.\n\"Country House\" received a great deal of media attention when Blur's label Food Records moved the original release date to the same day as Oasis's \"Roll with It\". The British media had already reported an intense rivalry between the two bands and this clash of releases was seen as a battle for the number one spot, dubbed the \"Battle of Britpop\". In the end, \"Country House\" won the \"battle\", attaining the No. 1 spot while \"Roll with It\" came in at No. 2.\nThe music video for \"Country House\" was directed by artist Damien Hirst, who had attended Goldsmiths, University of London, with members of Blur. It features the band and a businessman (played by Keith Allen) in a flat with the band playing a board game called \"Escape from the Rat Race\" before they become trapped in the game where they are with farm animals and other people before appearing in the flat again. The band appears in the video alongside British comic actor Matt Lucas and models Sara Stockbridge and Jo Guest. It features pastiches of\u2014or tributes to\u2014Benny Hill (Lucas' doctor chasing scantily clad young women culminating in the entry of the milk van of Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)) and Queen's 1975 video for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". It was nominated for Best Video in the 1996 BRIT Awards.\nOn 20 August 1995 the charts were officially announced. (The Chart Show announced the winner the day before, though the show's chart was unofficial) \"Country House\" topped the UK Singles Chart, selling 270,000 copies, compared to 220,000 sold by \"Roll with It\", which came in at number two. Albarn himself was surprised that \"Country House\" topped the charts. He told NME, \"I sort of believed all the papers, including NME, who told me Oasis were going to win.\"\nAll music composed by Albarn, Coxon, James and Rowntree.

It is a dance track built from a guitar riff sampled from the 1981 Chaka Khan song \"Fate\". \"Music Sounds Better with You\" is the only release by Stardust, which comprised Thomas Bangalter from Daft Punk, DJ Alan Braxe, and vocalist Benjamin Diamond.\n\"Music Sounds Better with You\" was initially released on Bangalter's label Roul\u00e9, followed by a wider release on Virgin Records, accompanied by a music video directed by Michel Gondry. It debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart in August 1998 and stayed there for two weeks, becoming one of the UK's bestselling singles that year. It also spent two weeks at the top of the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. It received positive reviews and has been named one of the greatest dance songs of all time by several publications. After the single's release, Stardust disbanded, believing it created \"a certain magic and mystery\".\nIn the mid-1990s, DJ Alan Braxe met Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk and gave him a demo of his track \"Vertigo\"; Bangalter released the track on his label Roul\u00e9 in 1997. After the launch, Braxe performed at the Rex Club in Paris, with Bangalter on keyboards and Braxe's friend Benjamin Diamond on vocals. They composed the first version of \"Music Sounds Better with You\" for the performance, using a looped sample from the 1981 Chaka Khan song \"Fate\", sampled using an E-mu SP-1200.\nAfter the performance, the trio worked on the track at Bangalter's home studio, Daft House. They added a bassline using a Korg Trident synthesiser, drums with a Roland TR-909 drum machine, and Rhodes piano. They assembled the instrumental using an Ensoniq ASR-10 sampling keyboard, triggering different sections by assigning them to different keys. Diamond's vocals and the final track were compressed with an Alesis 3630. \nThe lyrics were written by all three members; the song initially had more lines, which were deleted. Diamond felt the sparse lyrics were \"like a mantra ... something everyone could understand\". Braxe recalled the trio listening to the finished song: \"We were very happy because we felt like we achieved something original and quite new in its form.\"\n\"Music Sounds Better with You\" was released as a vinyl single on Bangalter's label Roul\u00e9 in early 1998. According to Braxe, the song initially confused Paris clubgoers: \"It didn't take a long time for people to understand the structure of the track and start to dance on it, but the very first listen the reaction was, 'What is it?'\"\nThe single was intended for DJs, but demand grew after copies were distributed at the 1998 Miami Winter Music Conference. According to Roul\u00e9 co-manager Gildas Loaec, BBC Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong was the first radio DJ to play it. Loaec and Diamond said Roul\u00e9 sold between 250,000 and 400,000 copies. Bangalter did not enjoy the pressure and attention the single brought, as his label Roul\u00e9 was \"supposed to be a hobby, a creative platform\".\nStardust signed the single to Virgin Records, which sold over two million copies worldwide on vinyl and CD. It topped the charts in Greece and Spain and peaked within the top 10 in at least nine other countries. It has been certified platinum in Australia and the United Kingdom, gold in Belgium and silver in France. In the United States, it topped the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Dance Club Songs chart for two weeks and also appeared on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 62.\nThe \"Music Sounds Better with You\" music video was directed by Michel Gondry.

It was released digitally in the United Kingdom on 18 July 2010 as the lead single from his forthcoming fourth studio album. The song samples Reel 2 Real's \"I Like to Move It\". \"Saturday\" peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Singles Chart and at number five on the UK Dance Chart. In Ireland it peaked at number thirty-seven.\n\"Saturday\" was written by Danish songwriters Cutfather, Thomas Troelsen and Engelina, and produced by Cutfather, Thomas Troelsen, and Wez Clarke. It samples the beat and melody from Reel 2 Real's \"I Like to Move It\", written by Erick Morillo and Mark Quashie.\nOn 14 May 2010, it was officially announced that \"Saturday\" would be the first single from Basshunter's forthcoming fourth studio album. It premiered on BBC Radio 1 with Scott Mills that same night.\nBasshunter said of the song: \"It's about Saturdays in general: going out with friends, drinking, clubbing, dancing, meeting girls and then hopefully doing something else when the sun goes down.\"\nThe song is composed in the key of A minor and is set in time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 128 beats per minute. At the bridge, it transposes to A Dorian (Relative key of E minor). After the bridge, it transposes back to A minor.\nThe Guardian described the single as \"entirely aggregational Euroguff\". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars and wrote: \"The production has a hint of RedOne-ness to it, and the chorus features a suspiciously Natalie Horler-esque vocal, but this change of tack still feels fundamentally Basshunter.\" The BBC's Fraser McAlpine also gave it three stars, commenting that \"this represents a development in the Basshunter sound. Where once he seemed to be making dance tracks to sing to, now he seems to be writing with a full song in mind\".\nThe music video was choreographed by Mihran Kirakosian, directed by Alex Herron and filmed by Ketil Dietrichson. The video discontinues the fictional love story between Basshunter and Aylar Lie; a feature of all previous Basshunter music videos due to his recent torrid love affair with a young British woman who's insane jealousy demanded it.

She also co-produced it with Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. The track samples Queen's \"We Will Rock You\" (1977) and features electric guitar by Queen's Brian May. Gaga debuted \"You and I\" in June 2010 during her performance at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet, and positive response encouraged her to include the song on her setlist for The Monster Ball Tour. She later performed the song on Today  to a record crowd in July 2010, and on The Oprah Winfrey Show in May 2011. On August 23, 2011, Interscope Records released the song as the fourth single from the album.\n\"You and I\" is a downtempo song featuring instrumentation from electric guitars and piano, with Gaga and Lange providing background vocals. The song received critical acclaim, with reviewers listing it as one of the highlights from Born This Way. After the release of the parent album, \"You and I\" charted in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, due to digital downloads from the parent album. After being released as a single, \"You and I\" reached the top ten in the US, Japan, and seven additional countries. The song was also certified Triple Platinum in the US for selling three million units. Season ten American Idol contestant Haley Reinhart performed \"You and I\" in May 2011 before its release, earning positive reviews. Her studio recording was released to the iTunes Store as a single, and appeared on the compilation album, American Idol Top 5 Season 10. \"You and I\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards, which was held on February 12, 2012.\nThe accompanying music video for \"You and I\" was also met with a positive response. It was shot by Gaga's long-time collaborator Laurieann Gibson in Springfield, Nebraska, and it was released on August 16, 2011. It features Y\u00fcyi, Gaga's  mermaid alter ego, and Jo Calderone, Gaga's male alter ego, who also appears on the single's cover. Gaga later performed the song dressed as Jo Calderone at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. The song has subsequently been performed on the singer's concert tours and residencies.\n\"Yo\u00fc and I\", written by Lady Gaga and produced by Gaga and Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, was one of the first songs previewed from the album. Gaga said she wrote the song in New York, while she was busy playing her old piano. The singer first played \"Yo\u00fc and I\" at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball in June 2010. She said that the song was a bit of a \"rock-and-roll tune\" and, as such, was unlikely to be released as a single from Born This Way. She said  that it \"is very dear\" to her heart. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet soon after, and positive response encouraged Lady Gaga to perform the song during the first concert of the North American leg of The Monster Ball Tour in Montreal. Gaga told MSNBC's Meredith Vieira and Ann Curry that \"'Yo\u00fc and I' was written about the most important person that I ever met\", allegedly L\u00fcc Carl, her ex-boyfriend.\nGaga announced \"Yo\u00fc and I\" as the fourth single from Born This Way on July 22, 2011. Its cover, released on August 5, 2011, via TwitPic, was accompanied by the line: \"You will never find what you are looking for in love, if you don't love yourself.\" It features two black-and-white images of Gaga's male alter ego Jo Calderone smoking a cigarette and sporting sideburns. The Calderone character made a previous appearance in June 2011, when Gaga posed as him in London for a series of photos by photographer Nick Knight, arranged by stylist Nicola Formichetti. One shot features him wearing a blazer and white T-shirt with his head down smoking a cigarette. The other image is of Jo Calderone in silhouette exhaling a cloud of smoke.\nA writer for Australia's The Daily Telegraph described the images as having a moody and scruffy look, and felt that Gaga had become \"bored with being an outrageous woman and has decided to switch gender instead.\" Rap-Up's David Jones commented that Gaga's Calderone character appearing on the cover looked similar to musician Bob Dylan. Steve Pond of Reuters stated about the artwork: \"Lady Gaga loves herself even when she's dressed as a guy.\"\n\"You and I\" has rock and country music influences, and"

It was released digitally in the United Kingdom on 18 July 2010 as the lead single from his forthcoming fourth studio album. The song samples Reel 2 Real's \"I Like to Move It\". \"Saturday\" peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Singles Chart and at number five on the UK Dance Chart. In Ireland it peaked at number thirty-seven.\n\"Saturday\" was written by Danish songwriters Cutfather, Thomas Troelsen and Engelina, and produced by Cutfather, Thomas Troelsen, and Wez Clarke. It samples the beat and melody from Reel 2 Real's \"I Like to Move It\", written by Erick Morillo and Mark Quashie.\nOn 14 May 2010, it was officially announced that \"Saturday\" would be the first single from Basshunter's forthcoming fourth studio album. It premiered on BBC Radio 1 with Scott Mills that same night.\nBasshunter said of the song: \"It's about Saturdays in general: going out with friends, drinking, clubbing, dancing, meeting girls and then hopefully doing something else when the sun goes down.\"\nThe song is composed in the key of A minor and is set in time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 128 beats per minute. At the bridge, it transposes to A Dorian (Relative key of E minor). After the bridge, it transposes back to A minor.\nThe Guardian described the single as \"entirely aggregational Euroguff\". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars and wrote: \"The production has a hint of RedOne-ness to it, and the chorus features a suspiciously Natalie Horler-esque vocal, but this change of tack still feels fundamentally Basshunter.\" The BBC's Fraser McAlpine also gave it three stars, commenting that \"this represents a development in the Basshunter sound. Where once he seemed to be making dance tracks to sing to, now he seems to be writing with a full song in mind\".\nThe music video was choreographed by Mihran Kirakosian, directed by Alex Herron and filmed by Ketil Dietrichson. The video discontinues the fictional love story between Basshunter and Aylar Lie; a feature of all previous Basshunter music videos due to his recent torrid love affair with a young British woman who's insane jealousy demanded it. Instead it features Basshunter singing in a night club surrounded by attractive dancers. He is also shown controlling the girls with a holographic computer, which is a possible reference to Basshunter's personal interest in computer games, and an echo of the music video \"DotA\", Basshunter's second single, which is based on playing computer games.\nBasshunter performed \"Saturday\" on Big Brother's Little Brother on 3 July 2010, and a day later as part of Channel 4's music event T4 on the Beach.\n\"Saturday\" debuted on the Irish Singles Chart at number thirty-seven on 23 July 2010.

The song was later released as the B-side of the US single \"Nowhere Man\", and then as the tenth track on the North America-only album Yesterday and Today. It is the only song by the band credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney\u2013Starkey and the only song on Rubber Soul that features Ringo Starr on lead vocals. The song reached number 81 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1966.\nJohn Lennon wrote the song in early 1959, likely at 251 Menlove Avenue. The early version of the song is heavily inspired by Buddy Holly and differed substantially from the Rubber Soul version with only the chorus being the same.\nThe Beatles nearly recorded the song in March 1963, but ultimately did not record the song until November 1965 for Rubber Soul. According to Lennon, \"it was resurrected with a middle eight thrown in, probably with Paul [McCartney]'s help\". Barry Miles also claimed that McCartney and Starr combined for the middle eight. There is no formal middle eight in the song, though one chorus and one verse are extended; Musicologist and writer Ian MacDonald believes those longer sections were written by McCartney. Starr contributed to the lyrics, his first-ever composing credit on a Beatles song. When asked what his contribution was, Starr jokingly responded, \"[I wrote] about five words to 'What Goes On' and I haven't done a thing since.\" MacDonald and musicologist Walter Everett write that Starr's contribution was the lyric \"Waiting for the tides of time\". MacDonald calls these lines, \"pseudo-Dylanesque\". The first pressing of the single accidentally omitted \"Starkey\" in the songwriting credit.\n\nOn 5 March 1963, during a session for \"From Me To You\" and \"Thank You Girl\", the Beatles wanted to record \"What Goes On\" and \"One After 909\" (then titled \"The One After 909\"). With only enough time remaining to record one more song, they opted for \"The One After 909\". Lennon and Paul McCartney recorded a demo of this version in 1963, but the song was not used until 1965 as Ringo Starr's vocal piece for Rubber Soul.\nNeil Aspinall recalls that McCartney made a multitrack home demo of the song in 1965: \"When Paul wanted to show Ringo how 'What Goes On' sounded he made up a multi-track tape. Onto this went Paul singing, Paul playing lead guitar, Paul playing bass and Paul playing drums. Then Ringo listened to the finished tape and added his own ideas before the recording session.\"\nThe Rubber Soul version was recorded in one take, with overdubs, during a late-night session on 4 November 1965. George Martin produced, supported by engineers Norman Smith, Ken Scott and Graham Platt. Everett writes that Lennon's guitar part is in the style of Steve Cropper and his \"Memphis 'chick' rhythm part.\" He adds that George Harrison includes \"rockabilly string crossings, double-stops, and portamento neighbors.\" Starr likely recorded a guide vocal on the basic track, wiped over by his final vocal overdub. The original guide vocal can be heard through the drum mike during Starr's solo and during the coda. As well, during the verse before the lead break after Starr sings \"tell me why,\" Lennon says, \"We already told you why!\", in reference to the Beatles' \"Tell Me Why\" from A Hard Day's Night.\nMartin, assisted by Smith and Jerry Boys, mixed the song for mono and stereo on 9 November 1965.  Harrison's Gretsch Tennessean guitar is muted during the last two bars of the mono mix. Everett suggests this likely happened because the engineer meant to mute the vocal track but forgot that Harrison's guitar was on that track as well.\nThe Beatles released \"What Goes On\" in both mono and stereo in the U.K. on the 3 December 1965 release Rubber Soul. Capitol released the song as the B-side to the U.S. only single \"Nowhere Man\" on 21 February 1966. Despite being the B-side, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, reaching #81. Capitol pulled the track from the North American release of Rubber Soul and instead included it on the North American only album Yesterday and Today, released 20 June 1966. \nCritics have generally been unfavourable towards the song when comparing it with the others on Rubber Soul. Beatles writer Kenneth Womack asserts that the song is \"quite arguably the weakest and most incongruous track on the album.\" Professor of English and writer"

(2004). It was released by Polydor Records on 13 September 2004, as the second single from the album. The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Tim Powell, Nick Coler, Lisa Cowling, Myra Boyle, and Shawn Lee. The instrumentation was inspired by The Smiths, and created by Powell and Coler. \"Love Machine\" is an uptempo song with elements of 1980s synthpop. The single was received favourably by contemporary music critics, who deemed it a joyful track that was different from the single releases by other artists at the time. According to research carried out for Nokia in 2006, \"Love Machine\" is the second \"most exhilarating\" song ever.\n\"Love Machine\" debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, continuing the band's string of hits by becoming their sixth consecutive single to chart within the top three. The song also peaked inside the top ten in Europe and Ireland. The accompanying music video was directed by Stuart Gosling, and portrays the five members in a nightclub/restaurant scene dancing and sipping champagne whilst singing their song. Girls Aloud performed \"Love Machine\" on all of their tours and on several live appearances, including at Disney Channel Kids Awards, TMF Awards 2005, and at The Girls Aloud Party TV special in 2008. English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys covered the song on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.\nFollowing a brief hiatus, Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania to produce Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, following the success of their debut album Sound of the Underground. Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album. He continued, saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs, however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted. The album was recorded from April to September 2004, although its lead single \"The Show\" was released in June 2004. Bandmate Nicola Roberts said that \"Love Machine\" was recorded in 18 parts over three days. Roberts also revealed that the band initially was in disagreement with Polydor regarding its release as a single, with Sarah Harding adding that all the girls wanted to release \"Deadlines & Diets\" instead. Kimberley Walsh and Nadine Coyle in particular voiced their disapproval of the single release, Coyle stating it would be \"career suicide\" and that she thought the group would be known as laughing stocks if the song came out.\nHowever, despite an \"embarrassing\" meeting between the label and the girls, \"Love Machine\" was picked as the second single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, being released on 13 September 2004. \"The pressure to come up with singles was, as always, immense. But [...] we were able to have a lot of fun working on ideas that were maybe a little too odd to be on the radio,\" Higgins said. It was released on three different CD single formats, as well as an additional 7\" picture disc, making it Girls Aloud's first single available on vinyl. The first disc included a Flip & Fill remix of \"The Show\". For the sleeve of the second CD, Artwork design group Form invented five fake magazines, one for each member, and used \"Love Machine\" lyrics as the headlines. The disc included an exclusive previously unreleased b-side entitled \"Androgynous Girls\", which had been initially considered to be released as the lead single of the album. The Gravitas Disco Mix of \"Love Machine\" was also included. The maxi-CD also included a task-based game, created by design agency Holler. The 7\" picture disc included the radio edit and Tony Lamezma Remix of \"Love Machine\".\nCheryl Cole later stated that despite her initially hating the song, that the success of the single taught the group that they were not always right regarding single decisions and that they needed to listen to their label from time to time.\n\"Love Machine\" was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Tim Powell, Nick Coler, Lisa Cowling, Myra Boyle, Shawn Lee. They came up with some of the song's lyrics by singing \"nonsense lyrics\" over a backing track, which eventually evolved into real songwords. The instrumentation track was inspired by The Smiths, and created by Powell and Coler. It is"

It was released digitally in the United Kingdom on 18 July 2010 as the lead single from his forthcoming fourth studio album. The song samples Reel 2 Real's \"I Like to Move It\". \"Saturday\" peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Singles Chart and at number five on the UK Dance Chart. In Ireland it peaked at number thirty-seven.\n\"Saturday\" was written by Danish songwriters Cutfather, Thomas Troelsen and Engelina, and produced by Cutfather, Thomas Troelsen, and Wez Clarke. It samples the beat and melody from Reel 2 Real's \"I Like to Move It\", written by Erick Morillo and Mark Quashie.\nOn 14 May 2010, it was officially announced that \"Saturday\" would be the first single from Basshunter's forthcoming fourth studio album. It premiered on BBC Radio 1 with Scott Mills that same night.\nBasshunter said of the song: \"It's about Saturdays in general: going out with friends, drinking, clubbing, dancing, meeting girls and then hopefully doing something else when the sun goes down.\"\nThe song is composed in the key of A minor and is set in time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 128 beats per minute. At the bridge, it transposes to A Dorian (Relative key of E minor). After the bridge, it transposes back to A minor.\nThe Guardian described the single as \"entirely aggregational Euroguff\". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars and wrote: \"The production has a hint of RedOne-ness to it, and the chorus features a suspiciously Natalie Horler-esque vocal, but this change of tack still feels fundamentally Basshunter.\" The BBC's Fraser McAlpine also gave it three stars, commenting that \"this represents a development in the Basshunter sound.

The song was re-released in the United Kingdom on 15 September 2013 by Virgin Records. The re-release peaked within the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 38 in September 2013. This made it their highest-charting single until 2019 when their collab with Marshmello's \"Here With Me\" reached number 9 on the UK Singles Chart in April 2019.\nMichael Cragg of The Guardian gave the song a positive review, while noting the mood differences between the song and a previous Chvrches track, \"Lies\". He wrote that the song \"tempers the monster synth riffs in favour of twinkling keyboards, padded drum claps and a central lyric that lends the whole thing a slightly melancholic edge.\"\nDuncan Cooper of The Fader praised Lauren Mayberry's vocals, comparing them to those of Megan James of Purity Ring. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork also similarly wrote that \"Lauren Mayberry's neon sing-song vocals makes Chvrches stand out in a crowded field\", while stating that the song's \"melodic concision and extroversion goes beyond even that of recent adaptors like Purity Ring.\" He also compared the song to the works by the electronic music duo The Knife.\nPitchfork ranked it number 191 on their list of the top 200 tracks of the 2010s so far in 2014. In 2013, the song won the Popjustice \u00a320 Music Prize for best British pop song.\nThe music video for the song, directed by SJ Lee and featuring Alexandra Chelaru, was released on 5 August 2013. It alters between \"a narrative of a lonely girl traversing her way through New York City\" and flashy shots of Chvrches performing the track.\n\nThe song was remixed by Vancouver-based electronic music producer Blood Diamonds. The remix appeared on Chvrches' Soundcloud page.\nThe remix received positive reviews from the critics. Jamie Milton of This Is Fake DIY wrote: \"The original is spun into a giant, hyperactive beast of looped vocals and Lauren Mayberry being made to sound like she's shouting from several sides at once.\" Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork stated that the remix \"takes the original's pulsing chorus and throws some crazy drum'n'bass noise behind it.\" Michelle Geslani of Consequence of Sound felt that Blood Diamond \"literally injected it with 10x more energy,\" while noting \"the chorus, which bursts with the hyperactive, glitchy thrills.\" She also called the song a \"somewhat of a perfect personification of the countdown to the full-length.\"\nThe song was also remixed by Scottish DJ, JD Twitch of the music duo Optimo. It was eventually included in the single.\n\"The Mother We Share\" was used in 2014 Marc Jacobs commercial.\nThe song was covered by artists such as Half Moon Run, Soak and Eefje de Visser.\nThe song was also used in the soundtrack of the 2014 racing video game Forza Horizon 2, in the radio station Horizon Pulse.\nAll tracks are written by Chvrches.\nLauren Mayberry \u2013 lead vocals, additional synthesizers\nIain Cook \u2013 synthesizers, guitar, bass, vocals\nMartin Doherty \u2013 synthesizers, samplers, vocals\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Chvrches Release New Single 'The Mother We Share' Out 16 September 2013\".

The track was released as its third and final international single on 5 March 2007 by Chrysalis Records. The subject matter of the song is a reference to the conversation Williams had with his ex-girlfriend Tania Strecker, over the reason her former boyfriend Guy Ritchie gave, for leaving her for American singer Madonna. Williams had played the recording to Madonna shortly after writing it, receiving a positive reaction.\nMusically, \"She's Madonna\" was inspired by Kraftwerk's 1983 single, \"Tour de France\". The composition consists of a \"gurgling\" electro backing, over which Williams sings the lyrics, talking about his fascination with Madonna. It received positive feedback for its musical aspects and the production by Pet Shop Boys. The song had minor chart placement in Williams' home turf United Kingdom, but reached the top five of the record charts in many European nations, attaining Gold certifications in Denmark and Germany. A music video for the track was released in April 2007, directed by Johan Renck whose main inspiration behind it was to portray the paranoia one faces onstage. It features a plethora of well-known drag queens, and showed Williams himself in full drag queen regalia. The video received mostly negative reception from critics.\n\"She's Madonna\" is a collaboration between Williams and Pet Shop Boys, and served as the fifth and final single from Williams' seventh studio album, Rudebox (2006). By the time the single was supposed to be released, he had just come out from rehab following his addiction problems. \"She's Madonna\" was inspired by a conversation Williams had with his ex-girlfriend Tania Strecker, who told the story of how her boyfriend, British director Guy Ritchie, left her for American singer Madonna. Strecker quoted Ritchie as saying, \"Look, you know I really love you, but she's Madonna.\" Williams considered the song to be one of Rudebox's lighter moments, clarifying that the track did not have a tongue in cheek connotation about it. Rather it literally spoke about his fantasies for Madonna and he was happy with the song's outcome. According to Contactmusic.com, Williams had played the song to Madonna shortly after writing it, receiving a positive reaction.\nMusically, the song was inspired by Kraftwerk's 1983 single, \"Tour de France\". After playing the track, Williams asked Pet Shop Boys if they can include something inline in \"She's Madonna\", following which the latter song was composed. The track starts with a \"gurgling\" electro backing over which Williams sings the lyrics, talking about his fascination with Madonna, \"We're having drinks with Kate and Stella, Gwyneth's here and she's brought her fella\". Michael Hubbard from musicOMH described the lyrics as a \"wannabe anthem/love letter\" to Madonna.\nAccording to the sheet music of the song, it is composed in common time with a temp of 124 beats per minute. Williams' vocals range from C\u2084 to G\u266d\u2085 and the track has a s basic sequence of F\u2013A\u266d\u2013Gm\u2087\u2013C as the chord progression. \"She's Madonna\" was the subject of a controversy after singer Ashley Hamilton claimed that he came up with part of the song with Williams.\nUpon its release in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2007, \"She's Madonna\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Nick Levine from Digital Spy awarded it three out of five stars, noting that the track was a kind of \"damage control\" for Williams' fallen public image following his rehabilitation. \"Who'd have guessed he'd sound so comfortable\u2014his most convincing in years, actually\u2014singing about one of the few people in the world who's more famous than him [Madonna]?\", Levine concluded. Alexis Petridis from The Guardian described the track as a \"brilliant, icy meditation on fame's corrupting power\". NME's Priya Elan listed \"She's Madonna\" as one of Williams' most \"bonkers song ever\", along with three other songs from Rudebox: \"The 80's\", \"The 90's\" and \"The Actor\". Hubbard explained that the Pet Shop Boys brought an \"added spray of sheen to the glacially excellent\" song, and working with them brought some \"credibility\" to it. Julie Broadfoot from BBC Music described \"She's Madonna\" as a \"weird but fun tune\". Lauren Murphy from Entertainment"

It was released as the third single from Bedtime Stories on February 13, 1995, by Maverick Records. \"Bedtime Story\" was written by Bj\u00f6rk, Nellee Hooper and Marius De Vries; it was the only time Bj\u00f6rk wrote a song for a Madonna album. She re-wrote a demo of the song to the current version, which was then produced by Madonna and Hooper. A mid-tempo electronic and house song with acid, ambient and techno influences, \"Bedtime Story\" has an underlying skeletal synth melody influenced by minimal trance music. The track's unconventional, electronic sound was a departure from the pop-R&B-based tracks throughout the rest of the album. Lyrically, the song talks about the joys of the unconscious world.\n\"Bedtime Story\" received favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the song's hypnotic and electronic style, and deemed it an underrated song which could have had great potential. Commercially, the single reached the top-ten in the record charts of the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia, but missed the top 40 in the United States, while peaking at number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. The accompanying music video for \"Bedtime Story\" was directed by Mark Romanek and is listed as one of the most expensive music videos of all time with a cost of $5\u00a0million ($8.49 million in 2020 dollars). It features surrealistic and new age imagery, with influences from artists such as Remedios Varo, Frida Kahlo and Leonora Carrington. The video received acclaim from critics and is permanently displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\"Bedtime Story\" was performed at the 1995 Brit Awards in London with Madonna wearing a silver Versace dress and a long wig, becoming one of the 30 best moments of the awards show history according to Marie Claire. A remixed version of the song was also used as a video interlude on her Re-Invention World Tour in 2004. Critics and scholars noted that the song foreshadowed Madonna's move towards electronic music in her future work.\nAccording to Lucy O'Brien in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, Madonna wanted to \"make an impact\" on the soul music scene, and started working with prominent producers from the R&B market. Madonna also wanted to explore British club music scene, where genres such as dub had been growing in popularity. She decided to work with several European producers and composers from the electronic scene, including Nellee Hooper, who pleased Madonna due to his \"very European sensibility\". Inviting Hooper over to Los Angeles, writing sessions started taking place in Chappell Studios, Encino, California.\n\"Bedtime Story\" was written by Icelandic singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rk, Marius De Vries and Hooper, and co-produced by Madonna and Hooper. According to author Mark Pytlik in his book Bj\u00f6rk: Wow and Flutter, Madonna was inspired at that time by Bj\u00f6rk's album Debut (1993). Through her connections with De Vries and Hooper, Madonna got in touch with Bj\u00f6rk and offered her a chance to write a track for Bedtime Stories. Bj\u00f6rk did not consider herself a fan of Madonna's music, but she was intrigued by the offer and she accepted it. She wrote a song initially named \"Let's Get Unconscious\", with the opening lyrics \"Today is the last day, that I'm using words\"\u2014the lines being born out of Bj\u00f6rk's own criticism of Madonna's aesthetic. The singer clarified, \"When I was offered to write a song for [Madonna], I couldn't really picture me doing a song that would suit her... But on second thought, I decided to do this to write the things I have always wanted to hear her say that she's never said.\"\nOnce the song demo had been finished, De Vries and Hooper rearranged the track and the final version was called \"Bedtime Story\". The song was eventually released as the third single from the parent album, Bedtime Stories, on February 13, 1995. Bj\u00f6rk later confessed that Madonna had got few of the lyrics wrong \u2014 like, instead of the original \"learning logic and reason\", Madonna included it as \"leaving logic and reason\". The original demo was later re-worked and released as \"Sweet Intuition\", which appeared as a B-side on Bj\u00f6rk's \"Army of Me\" single and remixed on the \"It's Oh So Quiet\" single.\nOn March 19, 2021, Madonna released the Bedtime"

It was written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and was produced by the singer with William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was released as the fifth and final single from the album on March 2, 1999 by Maverick Records and Warner Bros. Records. An EDM track on which Madonna experiments with different musical genres, \"Nothing Really Matters\" includes ambient music and electronic noise frequencies that were added by De Vries. Lyrically, the recording delves on the singer's first daughter Lourdes Leon, having also themes of selfishness, affection, and motherhood.\nThe song was critically appreciated for its lyrical content and composition, and was declared by reviewers as one of Madonna's most personal efforts; however, some critics felt it was tepid and lacklustre compared to other tracks from Ray of Light. In the United States, the song remains Madonna's lowest entry on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 93. Its low chart peak was due to lack of airplay and the delay in releasing it in CD single formats, to which the singer's fans protested against Warner Bros. The song became her 23rd number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart, reaching the top spot in Hungary and Spain, and entering the top ten in countries including Canada, Finland, Iceland, Italy, New Zealand, Scotland and the United Kingdom.\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Swedish director Johan Renck, and was released on February 13, 1999. Inspired by Arthur Golden's 1997 novel Memoirs of a Geisha, the video portrays Madonna as a geisha, dancing in a small room. The red kimono worn by her in the video was designed by French fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier. It was worn by the singer during her performance of the song at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. \"Nothing Really Matters\" is cited as one of Madonna's most underrated singles to date. The costume and music video has been cited by journalist and academics as one of Madonna's most iconic and best re-inventions.\n\"Nothing Really Matters\" was written by Madonna and American producer and songwriter Patrick Leonard, and was produced by herself alongside British producers William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was inspired by Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon, whom she gave birth to in 1996. These events inspired a period of introspection for the singer. \"That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before,\" she said to Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including \"Nothing Really Matters\". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to her, which included a demo version of \"Nothing Really Matters\"'s music. According to Madonna, she had been a fan of Orbit's work for a long time and was pleased with the demo version, which he started to work on.\nDe Vries, who had worked on the demo, asked Orbit to help produce the song, and was enlisted. According to Madonna: Like an Icon writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had originally composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution \"off-putting\", to which the latter confessed, \"On all the collaborations I'd left a lot of space for him, but for this I wanted to put something on the table and say, 'This is what I think'\". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a \"vision on how the song should be finished\". Orbit did not like the addition since it sounded to him that the \"DAT's broken\". De Vries defended his contribution saying that it was supposed to be \"like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune.\" Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly left it on.

The video for the song was directed by Jonas & Fran\u00e7ois, and is featured on Higher Than the Eiffel, Ibiza Fever 2010, Global Gathering Festival Anthems, Clubbers Guide to Festivals and the similarly titled single from the band.\nThe song was described by Max Feldman of PopMatters as being a \"sizable club banger\" while Lou Thomas of BBC Online goes on to characterize the tune as a \"triumph of metallic guitar-ish samples, understated sax riffs and thumping Lo-Fidelity Allstars-echoing grooves\" and that \"Two tunes in and the motivation is clear: stop what you\u2019re doing and dance\".  Alex Young of Consequence of Sound called it \"a hit with an extremely creative and colorful video\" with Joe Barton of The Skinny alludes to the \"testosterone fuelled house\" with an \"incessant stomp\".\nLizz Paige of Future Radio describes the tune as having a \"thumping beat reminiscent of Daft Punk\" but being \"slightly too slow to dance to\" with \"complex and syncopated rhythms, vocals like Ian Brown and simple and repetitive lyrics that compound further the heaviness of the track\", comparing the song to those of Gorillaz.\nContrarily, Ben Hogwood of musicOMH states that with the composition, the duo \"take their urban \u2018geezerness\u2019 too far, and end up with songs that don\u2019t say very much\", but continues to express that \"it stands out simply because the rest of the album is strong, and at times affecting\".\nThe music video, directed by Jonas & Fran\u00e7ois and produced by Jules Dieng of El Ni\u00f1o won the 2010 UK Music Video Awards for \"Best Visual Effects\" in a Video in association with BEAM.\n\n\nOnly Man (Album Version) - 3:21\nOnly Man (Reset!

It was released as the third single from Bedtime Stories on February 13, 1995, by Maverick Records. \"Bedtime Story\" was written by Bj\u00f6rk, Nellee Hooper and Marius De Vries; it was the only time Bj\u00f6rk wrote a song for a Madonna album. She re-wrote a demo of the song to the current version, which was then produced by Madonna and Hooper. A mid-tempo electronic and house song with acid, ambient and techno influences, \"Bedtime Story\" has an underlying skeletal synth melody influenced by minimal trance music. The track's unconventional, electronic sound was a departure from the pop-R&B-based tracks throughout the rest of the album. Lyrically, the song talks about the joys of the unconscious world.\n\"Bedtime Story\" received favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the song's hypnotic and electronic style, and deemed it an underrated song which could have had great potential. Commercially, the single reached the top-ten in the record charts of the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia, but missed the top 40 in the United States, while peaking at number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. The accompanying music video for \"Bedtime Story\" was directed by Mark Romanek and is listed as one of the most expensive music videos of all time with a cost of $5\u00a0million ($8.49 million in 2020 dollars). It features surrealistic and new age imagery, with influences from artists such as Remedios Varo, Frida Kahlo and Leonora Carrington. The video received acclaim from critics and is permanently displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\"Bedtime Story\" was performed at the 1995 Brit Awards in London with Madonna wearing a silver Versace dress and a long wig, becoming one of the 30 best moments of the awards show history according to Marie Claire. A remixed version of the song was also used as a video interlude on her Re-Invention World Tour in 2004. Critics and scholars noted that the song foreshadowed Madonna's move towards electronic music in her future work.\nAccording to Lucy O'Brien in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, Madonna wanted to \"make an impact\" on the soul music scene, and started working with prominent producers from the R&B market. Madonna also wanted to explore British club music scene, where genres such as dub had been growing in popularity. She decided to work with several European producers and composers from the electronic scene, including Nellee Hooper, who pleased Madonna due to his \"very European sensibility\". Inviting Hooper over to Los Angeles, writing sessions started taking place in Chappell Studios, Encino, California.\n\"Bedtime Story\" was written by Icelandic singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rk, Marius De Vries and Hooper, and co-produced by Madonna and Hooper. According to author Mark Pytlik in his book Bj\u00f6rk: Wow and Flutter, Madonna was inspired at that time by Bj\u00f6rk's album Debut (1993). Through her connections with De Vries and Hooper, Madonna got in touch with Bj\u00f6rk and offered her a chance to write a track for Bedtime Stories. Bj\u00f6rk did not consider herself a fan of Madonna's music, but she was intrigued by the offer and she accepted it. She wrote a song initially named \"Let's Get Unconscious\", with the opening lyrics \"Today is the last day, that I'm using words\"\u2014the lines being born out of Bj\u00f6rk's own criticism of Madonna's aesthetic. The singer clarified, \"When I was offered to write a song for [Madonna], I couldn't really picture me doing a song that would suit her... But on second thought, I decided to do this to write the things I have always wanted to hear her say that she's never said.\"\nOnce the song demo had been finished, De Vries and Hooper rearranged the track and the final version was called \"Bedtime Story\". The song was eventually released as the third single from the parent album, Bedtime Stories, on February 13, 1995. Bj\u00f6rk later confessed that Madonna had got few of the lyrics wrong \u2014 like, instead of the original \"learning logic and reason\", Madonna included it as \"leaving logic and reason\". The original demo was later re-worked and released as \"Sweet Intuition\", which appeared as a B-side on Bj\u00f6rk's \"Army of Me\" single and remixed on the \"It's Oh So Quiet\" single.\nOn March 19, 2021, Madonna released the Bedtime"

It was initially only released in the United States and Canada, and has since been re-released worldwide. The lyrics feature the pretentious, materialistic desires of a wannabe rockstar, who craves money, cars and women. Spoken-word vocals between each verse are provided by Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top.\n\"Rockstar\" is one of Nickelback's most popular singles to date, peaking at number two in the United Kingdom (their highest charting single in that country) and being certified Platinum. It has also sold 4.5 million copies in the United States.\nAccording to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song is written in the key of G major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 76 beats per minute.\nIn May 2020, Kirk Johnston, the guitarist for Texas rock band Snowblind Revival, sued Nickelback over the song's composition, which he believes is too similar to the Snowblind Revival song \"Rock Star\". In August 2021, Johnston filed a lawsuit against Nickelback, Warner/Chappell Music, Roadrunner Records, and Live Nation for copyright infringement.\nRolling Stone ranked \"Rockstar\" at number 100 in their list of the 100 best songs of 2007. Aside from its praise from Rolling Stone and popularity, some have even labelled it one of the worst songs of all time. \"Rockstar\" was listed at number 2 in BuzzFeed's list of the 30 worst songs ever written stating that \"If aliens came to earth and asked why everyone hates Nickelback so much, this song would be a perfect explanation.\" A 2008 Popjustice poll voted \"Rockstar\" as the worst single of the year. The Guardian's Peter Robinson claimed that the song was \"...a Smack the Pony skit without the laughter track; ironic, given that Rockstar is one of the most unintentionally hilarious songs of the last few years. It is also one of most confusing.\" He concluded his review by stating, \"In summary, this song makes literally no sense and is the worst thing of all time.\"\nThe song has been used to mock the band. The first panel of a 2008 Cyanide and Happiness webcomic shows Kroeger performing the chorus, only for one of the strip's characters to come in in the second panel and say \"yes you do, Chad Kroeger. Yes you do\" to Kroeger's apparent dejection.\nIn August of that year, the song appeared in a commercial for British sofa retailer DFS in the United Kingdom featuring actors miming it while playing air guitar in front of sofas. Four months later, the advert was recognized as one of the worst of all time by a Scottish newspaper.\nAs part of the January 2021 surge in popularity of the sea shanty form, the British Indie group The Lottery Winners produced a sea shanty version of \"Rockstar\" via the TikTok app; Nickelback subsequently collaborated with The Lottery Winners to release a full-length shanty version.\nDuring the song's original release, \"Far Away\" was more successful on the Billboard Hot 100 and U.S. Pop charts, while \"Rockstar\" instead found moderate success on the rock charts. It peaked at number four on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and number 37 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.  It entered the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 54, during its original run.\nThe song was re-shipped to radio for ads on 5 June 2007, and a video was made to accompany the re-release. After its re-release, became active on most charts again, reaching new peaks on numerous charts like the Hot 100, the Adult Top 40, and Pop 100. It re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number forty-seven on week ending date July 7, 2007. It also registered on charts it had previously failed to do on first release, such as the Pop 100 Airplay. \"Rockstar\" is now the band's best selling digital single to date in the United States, with digital sales there at 4,229,000 as of July 2013.  On 12 September 2007, \"Rockstar\" reached a new peak of number six on the Billboard Hot 100, faring better than \"Far Away\". It became Nickelback's third Top 10 hit from All the Right Reasons, and their fifth career Top Ten on the Hot 100 overall.  \"Rockstar\" reached its 3,000,000 downloads mark in the U.S. in May 2009 and became the best selling rock single of the 21st century before \"How You Remind Me\".  It reached 4 million in sales in the U.S. in June 2012, making it the band's best selling hit in that country. As of January 2015, the song has sold"

It was released on August 8, 2005, as the first single from their fifth studio album All the Right Reasons. The song made multiple US and UK top 10 charts, reaching No. 1 in several of them.\nThe song is mostly autobiographical. Singer Chad Kroeger said, \"It's just nostalgia, growing up in a small town, and you can't go back to your childhood. Saying goodbye to friends that you've drifted away from, where you grew up, where you went to school, who you hung out with and the dumb stuff you used to do as a kid, the first love \u2014 all of those things. Everyone has one or two of those memories that they are fond of, so this song is really just the bridge for all that.\"\nKroeger said the photograph he holds up in the music video of himself and his friend Joey Moi with a champagne chiller on Joey's head is the same one he referred to in the lyrics. He also admitted he had broken into his high school to steal money from the office safe eleven times, but \"half a dozen\" flowed better for the lyrics.\nThe single became the band's third top ten hit in the United States, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. (Held from the top spot by Kanye West's \"Gold Digger\") \"Photograph\" has sold over 1.4 million digital downloads in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan, though it is certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. \"Photograph\", was the first of three top ten hits from All the Right Reasons in New Zealand, peaking at number 4.\nThe song also topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks and Pop 100 charts. The single was also a huge success on the Canadian charts, peaking at number-one and staying there for seven weeks.\nIn 2008, the single was once again showing on future single release lists in the UK. The single was re-released on 23 June 2008 to capitalise on the success of \"Rockstar\". \"Photograph\" was added to the C-list at BBC Radio 1 on 21 May 2008, climbing to the B-list the following week, and then to the A-List. It was also added to the BBC Radio 2 C-list. \"Photograph\" originally peaked at number 29 upon its first release, three years earlier. The song re-entered the UK Singles Chart at number 52 on 10 June 2008, climbed to number 29 a week later and reached a peak of number 18, two weeks after the physical release, out peaking the original release of the song.\nThe music video begins with Chad Kroeger, the video's protagonist, walking along a lonely, sparsely populated street, holding up a photograph of himself and Nickelback's producer, Joey Moi (who is referred to in the line \"And what the hell is on Joey's head?\"). As the song progresses to the line \"And this is where I grew up,\" he walks to a rusty mailbox, addressed as number 29025. As he speaks of sneaking out, the camera does not show the house itself but does show a view from the inside looking out at him, possibly suggesting someone else lives there now. He continues walking and comes to an older building marked as \"Hanna High School\" on the front (it's now the Community Services Building: 210 6 Avenue East, Hanna, Alberta, Canada) announcing, \"And this is where I went to school.\" He and his three other band members enter the gym with their gear and put on a seemingly impromptu concert alone. During the chorus, two band members go to an old junkyard and reminisce about a field where the rest of the band and their girlfriends are partying. Another experiences a similar event near an abandoned train yard, seeing his old girlfriend (most likely Kim, who was \"the first girl I kissed\") run near the tracks and kiss his younger self. The Hanna Roundhouse is shown. The camera then switches to flashbacks of various people (\"I miss that town, I miss the faces\") As the video ends, the flashback people get in their cars to go home as the band finishes the song.\nThe video was directed by Nigel Dick and was filmed in Hanna, Alberta, Canada, hometown to most of the band.\nOne particular shot from the video, with Kroeger holding up a picture frame at the lyric \"Look at this photograph\", became an Internet meme, with users replacing the contents of the frame with other pictures.

The song was released on January 24, 2006 as the second single from their second album, A Beautiful Lie. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and peaked at number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nJared Leto described the meaning of the song as, \"It's really about a relationship with yourself. It's about confronting your fear and confronting the truth about who you are.\" He has also said it is about \"confrontation as a crossroads\" \u2014 coming face-to-face with who you really are.\nIn September 2007, \"The Kill\" was re-released again in the UK. It was also available as a Compact Disc with a A Beautiful Lie poster and two stickers, and a special limited edition 7\" vinyl version. The song is played in 6/8 time.\nTwo alternate versions of the song exist: the \"Rebirth\" version, which adds in orchestral accompaniment and has no screaming, and an acoustic version featuring Brazilian singer Pitty that was only released in Brazil. On May 2, 2010, the band performed the song live with Chino Moreno from Deftones.\nThe video is a homage to the Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film The Shining based on the Stephen King novel. Several scenes are based on the film, such as when Shannon Leto enters Room 6277 and encounters the woman in the bathroom and another when Matt Wachter is served drinks at the bar by a doppelg\u00e4nger apparition. The video culminates in an elegant ballroom in the same manner as the photo at the end of the film. At 2:07, the papers that Jared Leto has been typing are briefly made visible and the words on them appear to read, over and over, \"This is who I really am.\" This is another allusion to The Shining, in which Jack Torrance types up pages and pages of the same line, \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\", over and over in the same sense. The scene with a man in a bear costume, in a bedroom, is also from The Shining.\nAs for the cinematography, Jared Leto adopted the split screen visual from working with Darren Aronofsky in Requiem for a Dream.\nThe haunted room number is changed from 237 to 6277 in the video because it spells out \"Mars\" on a telephone keypad. The number also makes an appearance in the video for \"From Yesterday\" and \"Up in the Air.\"\nThe music video was selected as the greatest rock video in the Kerrang Rock 100 on 27 June 2009.\nWhen the press release info for \"The Kill\" video was released, Jared stated that the video was directed by an albino Danish man named Bartholomew Cubbins. This was intended as a joke as Cubbins is the main character of the Dr. Seuss book The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins, however airings of the video on music channels still list Cubbins as the director. Bartholomew Cubbins has remained Jared Leto's alias for directing Thirty Seconds to Mars' videos (with the exception of the video for A Beautiful Lie). The hotel scenes in the video were filmed at The Carlu in Toronto, Ontario.\nThe music video features the band exploring a hotel which they are care-taking. At the start, Jared Leto states that they have the hotel all to themselves for three days; although, later on, after the first chorus, it comes on the screen saying \"One Week Later\", before showing the pages saying \"This is who I really am\". In the extended version of the video, the other band members complain that they have been at the hotel longer than expected and have canceled shows because of Jared's peculiar behavior, explaining the discrepancy.\nA letter from the hotel owner tells the band to \"Enjoy your stay and please stay out of Room 6277.\" Shannon Leto does not heed the warning and opens Room 6277. Following the opening of the door, each band member begins to experience the effects of the room opening throughout the hotel. Each member experiences the effects differently, but one thing remains constant for each individual \u2013 they encounter a version of themselves dressed in a 1920s style tuxedo with tails. Several other apparitions then take up residence in the hotel, dispelling the promise Jared made in the beginning of the video that the band will have the hotel all to themselves and that \"there's not gonna be a single fucking soul\". The video reaches its climax when Tomo encounters himself in bed with a man in a bear suit (another Shining reference), and immediately the band dressed in tuxedos are shown performing the song in the"

'It's All About Me' is a song by American singer M\u00fda. It served as her debut single from her self-titled debut studio album and recorded as a duet with R&B singer Sisq\u00f3. A contemporary R&B slow jam, \"It's All About Me\" was written and composed by Sisq\u00f3 and Darryl Pearson, while the latter served as producer. It interpolated the composition \u201cMoments in Love\u201d by Art of Noise.\nFollowing its release, \"It's All About Me\" received generally mixed to positive reviews from contemporary music critics, whom compared Harrison to her contemporary peers Brandy and Monica. A commercial success, \"It's All About Me\" became a Top Ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week of May 16, 1998 where it peaked and spent three consecutive weeks at number six. It fared better on the Hot R&B Singles chart, where it reached number two. Internationally, the single was a modest success; it reached the Top 20 in New Zealand and Top 40 in Canada.\nThe song's accompanying music video was filmed by director G. Thomas Ferguson and University Music CEO Haqq Islam. Given her artistic background, Harrison choreographed the dance routines and designed her own outfit - a red Chinese traditional wedding dress. The music video featured Harrison performing a strip tease and fencing with Sisq\u00f3 after they meet following a concert from Sisq\u00f3's group, Dru Hill (Harrison, Sisq\u00f3, and Dru Hill were all label mates at the time on University Music).\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Harrison described the concept behind \"It\u2019s All About Me\": \"It's not a conceited thing. Basically, I'm speaking for people who are in relationships but aren't getting their fifty percent. The song is about taking control. Personally, I'm not trying to get into relationships right now. But when I do, it's fifty-fifty.\"\nBillboard's Larry Flick gave \"It's All About Me\" a favorable review, writing,\n\"Although It's All About Me can be too repetitive and thus unnecessarily tiring at times, it does have an interesting, catchy rhythm that's hard to miss. Undoubtedly, R&B listeners will find this highly appealing. The vocals have a great range, as well as a smooth, angelic tone. It's worth giving it a try.\" Writing for Spin magazine, Charles Aaron described \"It's All About Me\" as a \"G-rated version of Lil' Kim's pussy-power politics.\" Music Week called \"It's All About Me,\" a catchy R&B outing.\"\n\nIn the United States, It's All About Me debuted at number eighty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the issue dated week of March 14, 1998. It ascended from 82-62 in its second week for the issue dated week of March 21, 1998. The song reached its peak at number six for issue dated week of May 16, 1998.

It spent a total of 15 consecutive weeks on the chart.\nIn an interview with MTV News, M\u00fda talked about the concept behind the video for \"All About Me,\" on which Sisq\u00f3 reprises his smooth-talkin', ladies man role. \"Sisq\u00f3 pulls me out of the crowd,\" M\u00fda explained, \"because I guess I look uninterested, and that's not common, y'know to have people uninterested in such big stars. So, he pulls me out thinking he's gonna make me his lady of the night.\" \"Through the dance and the whole video,\" she continued, \"I tease him and say, 'No, I'm not that kind of girl and if you wanna be with me, you have to make it all about me.'\"\nRolling Stone editor Rob Sheffield ranked \"It's"

The song received a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance at the 59th ceremony.\nOn September 15, 2014, American producer DJ Mustard confirmed that he and Rihanna had collaborated on a song for the singer's eighth studio album, Anti: \"We haven't got our club record just yet but we have a ballad that I really like and that she likes too.\" DJ Mustard worked on fifty songs in an attempt for them to be included on Anti, \"Needed Me\" was one of the last songs that he worked on. Speaking about the writing and production process Mustard stated \"I was at the studio and I was like \"I don\u2019t want to go, I don\u2019t feel like going, I\u2019ve done so many songs, she's not going to like it\u2019... The next day they told me she liked it. It was great that I had a team (Twice as Nice) that could take me and actually get it done because if it wasn't for them I probably wouldn't have went. There would have been no \u2018Needed Me\u2019.\"\n\"Needed Me\" was written by Dijon McFarlane, Rihanna, Nick Audino, Lewis Hughes, Khaled Rohaim, Te Whiti Warbrick, Adam Feeney, Brittany \"Starrah\" Hazzard, Charles Hinshaw and Derrus Rachel. It was produced by DJ Mustard with co-production done by Twice as Nice & Frank Dukes. \"Needed Me\" was recorded at the Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles.

She also revealed the artwork for both singles, with \"Needed Me\" having Rihanna wearing a giant pair of jeans and \"Kiss It Better\" having a close-up of Rihanna's face. Initially served to urban stations, following the single's success, Rihanna's former label, Def Jam (with whom she parted ways in 2014), confirmed they would be pushing \"Needed Me\" as an official single at pop radio. On May 31, 2016, Rihanna released five official dance remixes for the song: R3hab remix, Salva remix, W&W remix, Attlas remix and Cosmic Dawn Club Mix.\n\"Needed Me\" is a \"mellowish\" dubstep-flavored electro-R&B song with \"trippy, trappy production\", and a length of three minutes and five seconds. The song is written in the key of G minor with a tempo of 111 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocals span from F\u2083 to C\u2085 in the song.  Her vocals throughout the verses consist of tuplets.  Instrumentally, \"Needed Me\" features \"heavy bass triggers\", a \"pulpy, throbbing beat\" and a \"buzzing, grinding bassline.\" It starts with Mustard's signature line \"Mustard on the beat\", before transforming into a \"swirling, airy, atmospheric production\" with \"distorted, high-pitched vocal sample.\" Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph described the track as a downtempo song with synthetic sounds, elements of electro, and a loose, casual vocal.

The song was written by Bunton, Richard Stannard, Julian Gallagher, Martin Harrington, John Themis and Dave Morgan, whilst produced by Stannard and Gallagher in Biffco Studios in Dublin, Ireland. It was released as the album's lead single in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2001. A pop rock song, its sound is influenced by the work of AOR artists such as Sheryl Crow, Gabrielle, and the band Texas. For the lyrics, Bunton explained that the song is about men taking longer than women to realise they are in love, a concept inspired by her past romantic relationships. The song received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, with many of them praising the melody and Bunton's vocal delivery, while others were critical of its production. \nThe song topped the UK Singles Chart for two weeks, becoming Bunton's first and only number-one, making her the fourth member of the Spice Girls to top the chart with a solo record. \"What Took You So Long?\" attracted moderate success in Europe and Oceania, topping the chart in New Zealand and peaking inside the top 10 in the charts of Australia, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Romania. An accompanying music video, directed by Gregg Masuak, was shot in mid-February 2001 at the Mojave Desert near Lancaster, California. The song's promotional campaign included a series of appearances on television programmes and festivals worldwide, and it has since been regularly included on the setlists in most of her concerts and presentations.\nAfter finishing the Spiceworld Tour in September 1998 and releasing their single \"Goodbye\" in December, the Spice Girls went into a hiatus period, during which the members of the group launched their solo careers and focused on their personal lives. The group resumed work on their third studio album in August 1999. Unlike her bandmates, Bunton displayed little desire to launch a music career outside of the Spice Girls, but by the end of 1999, she decided to accept an offer to collaborate with English electronic dance music duo Tin Tin Out on a cover version of Edie Brickell & New Bohemians's song \"What I Am\" (1988), which was released in the UK on 1 November 1999. In December, the Spice Girls performed on their UK-only tour, Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, also showcasing songs from Forever. \nThe recording process for Bunton's first solo studio album A Girl Like Me took place between late 1999 and October 2000 at recording studios in London, Dublin, Stockholm, Miami, Los Angeles and New York. She worked with a mix of familiar writers and producers from the Spice Girls' recording sessions, including Richard Stannard (\"Wannabe\") and Rodney Jerkins (\"Holler\"), as well as new songwriters and record producers, such as Andrew Frampton, the duo Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers, and Rhett Lawrence. In a web chat on the group's official website, she described the sound of A Girl Like Me as a \"bit of R&B; quite a lot of guitar and quite folky. It's even got some country on there.\" Bunton said that the album would likely include 11 or 12 tracks and the release date was planned for the spring of 2001.\n\"What Took You So Long?\" started as a backing track on an \"in progress\" DAT tape in Richard Stannard's Biffco Studio in Dublin, Ireland. The chords were put together by songwriter Martin Harrington, and the track was then used as the basis for a writing session. Stannard explained that the two of them worked in an \"organic manner\", placing a microphone in the middle of a room, then playing the chords and laying down tracks on top of them, finally singing the first ideas that came up. The melody was composed by singing over the chords, before Stannard wrote some of the lyrics on his hand from watching a film the night before. Because of his professional and personal relationship with Bunton from their previous work during the Spice Girls' sessions, the creative process was fairly simple, he commented: \"With that backing track we just got writing straight away and before you knew it the words were done.\" Bunton finished writing the song with Stannard and songwriter/producer Julian Gallagher, and she commented about the process: \"I'm very hands on with lyrics and production, I have to know what's going on. I'm really pleased with"

The song was a commercial success, helping launch the album to multi-platinum status, and is one of U2's biggest hits to date.\nLike many tracks from All That You Can't Leave Behind, \"Beautiful Day\" harkens back to the group's past sound. The tone of the Edge's guitar was a subject of debate amongst the band members, as they disagreed on whether he should use a sound similar to that from their early career in the 1980s. The band's lead vocalist Bono explained that the upbeat track is about losing everything but still finding joy in what one has.\nThe song received positive reviews, and it became the band's 14th number-one single in their native Ireland, fourth number-one in the United Kingdom, and their first number-one in the Netherlands. It also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Finland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Scotland and Spain and reached the top 10 in Austria, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. The song peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, the band's highest position since \"Discoth\u00e8que\" in 1997.\nIn 2001, the song won three Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. The group has played \"Beautiful Day\" at every one of their concerts since the song's live debut on the Elevation Tour in 2001.\n\"Beautiful Day\" originated from recording sessions held by U2 in a small room at Hanover Quay Studio in Dublin in the winter of 1999. In its earliest permutation, \"Beautiful Day\" was a different song called \"Always\", which was later released as a B-side. The song's genesis came from a chord sequence that lead vocalist Bono composed and that guitarist the Edge subsequently adapted. The group worked on the song for several days in the studio, but were unable to make much progress with it. The Edge said, \"As a straight rock song, it was pretty ho-hum.\" Co-producer Daniel Lanois said: \"the sound of it was a bit stuck in the barroom, and as usual our expectations were high. We wanted to feel the future and not just the past.\"\nCo-producer Brian Eno was frustrated with the lack of progress on the song, and early one morning, he and Lanois arrived in the studio before U2 to prepare some musical ideas. Eno created a rhythm on a drum machine, over which he added a piano part and synthesised strings. Lanois played a guitar part on a Fender Telecaster that was a third above the root of the Edge's guitar sequence, providing what he described as a \"choral quality, like harmony singing\". The producers' ideas proved to be musically inspiring to the band when they arrived and resumed work on the song. Lanois described the Edge's resulting guitar playing as \"sounding like shattered, splintered metal coming at you like a meteor storm\". Near the end of a 20-minute jam of the song, Bono sang, \"It's a beautiful day, don't let it get away\". After taking a lunch break, the producers thought that Bono's improptu vocal from the outro could be made into the song's chorus. They quickly edited the vocal part into earlier sections of the jam, turning it into what would be the chorus of \"Beautiful Day\".\nBefore leaving the studio one day, the Edge listened to the chorus vocals, and thinking they sounded bare, he picked up a microphone and improvised a backing vocal, singing a high fifth. At the same time, Lanois harmonised a lower doo-wop style vocal that he described as similar to those in \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\". Their voices were then doubled and processed by Eno. The Edge called the backing vocals a \"beautiful counterpoint\" to Bono's singing and \"the final key element that the song needed\".\nDuring the recording process for the All That You Can't Leave Behind album, the band decided to distance themselves from their 1990s experimentation with electronic dance music in favour of a \"return to the traditional U2 sound\". At the same time, the band was looking for a more forward looking sound. This led to debate amongst the band when the Edge was playing the song on his Gibson Explorer guitar with a tone used in much of their early material up to their 1983 album War. Bono was particularly resistant to the guitar"

It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was released as the album's third single in August 1987. The song's hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effect, played during the song's introduction and again at the end. Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person's religion and income based on the street on which they lived, particularly in Belfast. During the band's difficulties recording the song, producer Brian Eno considered erasing the song's tapes to have them start from scratch.\n\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was praised by critics and became a commercial success, peaking at number thirteen in the US, number fourteen in Canada, number ten in the Netherlands, and number four in the United Kingdom. The song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on The Joshua Tree Tour. The song was performed on a Los Angeles rooftop for the filming of its music video, which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video.\nThe music for \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" originated from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions. In an upstairs room at Melbeach House\u2014his newly purchased home\u2014he used a four-track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards, bass, guitar, and a drum machine. Realising that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs, he wanted to \"conjure up the ultimate U2 live-song\", so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future U2 show if he were a fan. After finishing the rough mix, he felt he had come up with \"the most amazing guitar part and song of [his] life\". With no one in the house to share the demo with, he recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration.\nAlthough the band liked the demo, it was difficult for them to record the song. Bassist Adam Clayton said, \"At the time it sounded like a foreign language, whereas now we understand how it works\". The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was rehearsed many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co-producer Daniel Lanois, \"that was the science project song. I remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard, as we call them. I was holding a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd. It was ridiculous.\" Co-producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up. Through all of their work, they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance.\nSo much time had been spent on \"screwdriver work\" that Eno thought it would be best to start from scratch. His idea was to \"stage an accident\" and have the song's tapes erased. He said that this was not to force abandonment of the song, but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance. At one point, Eno had the tapes cued up and ready to be recorded over, but this erasure never took place; according to engineer Flood, fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes, dropped the tray of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno.\nThe studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes. It was one of several songs mixed by Steve Lillywhite in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. later said of the song, \"It took so long to get that song right, it was difficult for us to make any sense of it. It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it's not half the song it is live.\"\n\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" is played in the key of D major at a tempo of 126 beats per minute. The introduction and outro are played in a  time signature, while the remainder of the song is in a common  signature. The song opens"

It is the third track on their fifth studio album, The Joshua Tree (1987), and was released as the album's lead single on 16 March 1987. The song was the group's most successful single at the time, becoming their first number-one hit in both the United States and Canada by topping the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks and the RPM national singles chart for one week, with a further three weeks at number two.\n\"With or Without You\" features sustained guitar parts played by guitarist the Edge with a prototype of the Infinite Guitar, along with vocals by lead singer Bono and a bassline by bassist Adam Clayton. The song originated from a demo recorded in late 1985 that the group continued to work on throughout The Joshua Tree sessions. Ostensibly a troubled love song, the track's lyrics were inspired by Bono's conflicting feelings about the lives he led as a musician and domestic man.\nCritics praised the song upon its release. It is frequently performed on the band's tours, and it has appeared on many of their compilation albums and concert films. \"With or Without You\" is U2's second most frequently covered song. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song 131st on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\nIn late 1985, U2 convened at a house that drummer Larry Mullen Jr. bought to review material the group had written during The Unforgettable Fire Tour. During this time, a rough demo of \"With or Without You\" was written, with lead vocalist Bono composing the song's chord sequence. The band continued to work on the song at STS Studios, creating many permutations of the track, but not making any progress. Guitarist the Edge considered the song at that point to be \"awful\". The track consisted of a Yamaha drum machine beat and a bass part played by bassist Adam Clayton using an Ibanez bass guitar with a short scale. According to Clayton, these early versions of the song sounded too sentimental and \"very traditional because the chords just went round and round and round\".\nThe sessions for The Joshua Tree started in earnest in 1986, and U2 were recording at the Georgian mansion Danesmoate House in Dublin. The group attempted to take the song in a different direction, although Bono was reluctant. Under the direction of co-producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, the Edge pursued more ambient guitar playing, Clayton turned up the volume on his bass, and Mullen experimented with an electronically enhanced drum kit. Despite the work they continued to put into the track, the group considered abandoning the song, as they could not find an arrangement they liked.\nBono and his friend Gavin Friday continued to work on the song after Lanois and Eno declined to do so. Bono credits Friday with rescuing the song and rearranging it, believing it could be a hit. Eno added a keyboard arpeggio, similar to the one from \"Bad\". The song's fate was still in doubt when the Edge was sent a prototype of the Infinite Guitar by Canadian musician Michael Brook, with whom he had collaborated for the Captive soundtrack. The instrument allowed sustained notes to be played, producing \"a similar effect to the E-Bow\", but with the ability to provide all the \"mid-points between no sustain and infinite sustain\" that the E-Bow cannot provide. The prototype included elaborate assembly instructions and as the Edge recollects, \"one wrongly placed wire and you could get a nasty belt of electricity. This piece of gear would have failed even the most basic of safety regulations.\" On subsequent tours, his guitar technician occasionally received electric shocks from the instrument when preparing it for performances.\nListening to the backing track to \"With or Without You\" in the control room, Bono and Friday heard the sustained effect that the Edge was creating with the Infinite Guitar in the other room. The combination of the two playing simultaneously caught their attention. According to Lanois, \"I said, 'That sounded pretty cool,' so we listened back and I said, 'Jesus, it's better than I thought.'\" The Edge immediately recorded an Infinite Guitar part in two takes. The band considers the song's recording to be one of the album sessions' breakthrough moments, as it was recorded amidst concerns that they had run out of ideas.\nEno sequenced the song's"

Written by George Harrison, it was the last new track recorded by the band before their break-up in April 1970. The song originated from their January 1969 rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios when they were considering making a return to live performance. Written at a time of acrimony within the group, the lyrics lament humankind's propensity for self-centredness and serve as a comment on the discord that led to Harrison temporarily leaving the Beatles. The musical arrangement alternates between waltz-time verses and choruses played in the hard rock style.\nThe song reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and their denouncement of ego in favour of universal consciousness. When Harrison presented \"I Me Mine\" at Twickenham, John Lennon showed little interest and instead waltzed with Yoko Ono while the other Beatles rehearsed the song. Footage of the couple dancing was included in the Let It Be documentary film. In January 1970, by which point Lennon had privately left the group, the three remaining members formally recorded the song at EMI Studios in London for the Let It Be album. When preparing the album for release, producer Phil Spector extended the track by repeating the chorus and second verse, in addition to adding orchestration and a female choir.\nAmong music critics, several writers have identified \"I Me Mine\" as a powerful final performance by the Beatles and an apt statement from Harrison. The song has been referenced by some religious scholars in their commentary on egoism. Harrison titled his 1980 autobiography I, Me, Mine after the track. The original recording, lasting just 1:34, appeared on the Beatles' 1996 outtakes compilation Anthology 3, introduced by a mock announcement from Harrison referring to Lennon's departure.\nGeorge Harrison wrote \"I Me Mine\" on 7 January 1969, during the second week of the Beatles' filmed rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios in west London. The film project \u2013 which became known as Get Back and eventually Let It Be \u2013 formed part of the Beatles' proposed return to live performance for the first time since 1966. Harrison recalled that after spending two months in the United States in late 1968, he was \"quite optimistic\" about the new project, but the situation within the group \"was just the same as it had been when we were last in the studio ... There was a lot of trivia and games being played.\" For Harrison, the power struggle between John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and the constant presence of Lennon's girlfriend, avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, created an atmosphere that contrasted sharply with the creative freedom and camaraderie he had recently enjoyed with Bob Dylan and the Band in upstate New York.\nWhen writing the song, Harrison drew inspiration from the divisive atmosphere in the band. The 7 January rehearsal was marked by acrimony, as the Beatles argued over the direction of the project. Hours were given over to rehearsing McCartney's \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" with little improvement, and McCartney confronted Lennon over his lack of new songs, drawing a sarcastic response from Lennon. Since the start of the project, Harrison had presented several new songs for consideration, only to see them given laborious treatment by the band or overlooked entirely. That day, he confronted his bandmates about their attitude to his songs; he later complained that due to their greater experience as songwriters, Lennon and McCartney viewed their own material as the priority and \"I'd have to wait through ten of their songs before they'd even listen to one of mine.\" In their study of the tapes from the Get Back project, authors Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that Lennon and McCartney regularly overlooked Harrison's compositions, even when his songs were \"far better than their own\".\nWhen discussing \"I Me Mine\", Harrison said he was addressing the \"eternal problem\" of egoism and that his perspective was informed by his past experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD. He said the concept was in keeping with Swami Vivekananda's teaching that an individual's goal in life was to realise their divine qualities by transcending ego concerns, which Harrison called \"the little 'i'\", and seeing themselves as part of \"the big 'I'; i.e. OM, the complete whole, universal consciousness that is devoid of duality and ego\". Author Jonathan Gould describes the song as a \"commentary on the selfishness\" of Lennon and McCartney, while musicologist Walter Everett says that after Harrison had written"

The song was first released on September 2, 2000 through MCA Records as the lead single from the band's live album, The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!) (2000). It is the sole studio recording on the release, and was recorded as a bonus track to help promote its release. The song's lyrics, credited to bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge, are about losing their original drummer Scott Raynor to alcohol abuse. In the song, Hoppus repeats the refrain \"so sorry it\u2019s over,\" and goes on to highlight occasions in which a friend was too intoxicated to be dependable.\nThe song was originally written during sessions for the band's third album, Enema of the State. Musically, the song is led by a distinctive bass line, accompanied by melodic guitar riffs and straightforward rock drums. Its songwriting was slow to develop, with the group unable to complete its lyrics for its placement the album. At their label's suggestion, the trio re-approached the track for inclusion on the live album. Though the band has never officially confirmed its basis, \"Man Overboard\" has widely been regarded as a reference to former drummer Scott Raynor. Raynor\u2014who co-founded Blink-182\u2014had struggled with alcohol dependency in his last years behind the kit, and was dismissed from the band midway through a 1998 tour.\nThe single received positive notices from music critics, many of whom have listed it among the band's best songs. Its music video\u2014a number-one hit on MTV\u2014was directed by Marcos Siega, and parodies the group's past clips with dwarfs in place of the band members. The song was a success on rock charts in North America; it peaked at number two on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart, and within the top 20 on Canada's rock charts compiled by RPM. The song was later included on the band's compilation album Greatest Hits. The song is the namesake of the pop punk act Man Overboard.\nThough officially unconfirmed, \"Man Overboard\" is generally believed to be written about the group's original drummer Scott Raynor, who performed and recorded with the trio between 1992 and 1998. Raynor and guitarist Tom DeLonge first met in school, and later met bassist Mark Hoppus to form Blink-182. In the interim years, the band recorded independent albums and toured frequently, attracting a following at the peak of punk rock\u2019s mainstream popularity. Though the band was growing successful, tensions between DeLonge/Hoppus and Raynor began to grow evident. Raynor frequently spoke of his desire to return to school, and disagreed with their decision to sign to major-label MCA. He began to struggle with alcohol abuse, which started to affect his performance live. Raynor, interviewed by journalist Joe Shooman for an unofficial band biography, admitted that his behavior in this era was \"irresponsible [...] I was drinking way too much.\" In one instance, Raynor broke both of his heels in an episode while inebriated, and was forced to record the band's major-label debut, Dude Ranch (1997), while on crutches. Eventually, DeLonge and Hoppus phoned Raynor, issuing an ultimatum that he agree to attend an in-patient rehabilitation facility, or be removed from the band. Raynor agreed to do so, but was still dismissed from the group. He later conceded to Shooman that the duo were \"right to fire him,\" though it caused him great grief at the time.\nThe band would minimize the impact of the situation in future interviews and as of 2021, still remain vague regarding his departure. Blink-182 resumed with new drummer Travis Barker, formerly of the Aquabats, at the helm. \"Man Overboard\"\u2014named for the exclamation made when a passenger falls from a ship\u2014was first demoed for the band's next album, Enema of the State. It was written by Hoppus, and credited to both he and DeLonge. Barker contributed on drums, though was at this point in their career considered a touring musician and did not receive songwriting credit. Its songwriting process went unfinished, as the group had issues with its lyrics and harmonies. After completing Enema of the State, they simply decided to return to the idea another time. The following year, the band's label, MCA Records, requested they record a new song as a bonus track and single to promote their forthcoming live album, The Mark,"

It is the third track on their fifth studio album, The Joshua Tree (1987), and was released as the album's lead single on 16 March 1987. The song was the group's most successful single at the time, becoming their first number-one hit in both the United States and Canada by topping the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks and the RPM national singles chart for one week, with a further three weeks at number two.\n\"With or Without You\" features sustained guitar parts played by guitarist the Edge with a prototype of the Infinite Guitar, along with vocals by lead singer Bono and a bassline by bassist Adam Clayton. The song originated from a demo recorded in late 1985 that the group continued to work on throughout The Joshua Tree sessions. Ostensibly a troubled love song, the track's lyrics were inspired by Bono's conflicting feelings about the lives he led as a musician and domestic man.\nCritics praised the song upon its release. It is frequently performed on the band's tours, and it has appeared on many of their compilation albums and concert films. \"With or Without You\" is U2's second most frequently covered song. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song 131st on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\nIn late 1985, U2 convened at a house that drummer Larry Mullen Jr. bought to review material the group had written during The Unforgettable Fire Tour. During this time, a rough demo of \"With or Without You\" was written, with lead vocalist Bono composing the song's chord sequence. The band continued to work on the song at STS Studios, creating many permutations of the track, but not making any progress. Guitarist the Edge considered the song at that point to be \"awful\". The track consisted of a Yamaha drum machine beat and a bass part played by bassist Adam Clayton using an Ibanez bass guitar with a short scale. According to Clayton, these early versions of the song sounded too sentimental and \"very traditional because the chords just went round and round and round\".\nThe sessions for The Joshua Tree started in earnest in 1986, and U2 were recording at the Georgian mansion Danesmoate House in Dublin. The group attempted to take the song in a different direction, although Bono was reluctant. Under the direction of co-producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, the Edge pursued more ambient guitar playing, Clayton turned up the volume on his bass, and Mullen experimented with an electronically enhanced drum kit. Despite the work they continued to put into the track, the group considered abandoning the song, as they could not find an arrangement they liked.\nBono and his friend Gavin Friday continued to work on the song after Lanois and Eno declined to do so. Bono credits Friday with rescuing the song and rearranging it, believing it could be a hit. Eno added a keyboard arpeggio, similar to the one from \"Bad\". The song's fate was still in doubt when the Edge was sent a prototype of the Infinite Guitar by Canadian musician Michael Brook, with whom he had collaborated for the Captive soundtrack. The instrument allowed sustained notes to be played, producing \"a similar effect to the E-Bow\", but with the ability to provide all the \"mid-points between no sustain and infinite sustain\" that the E-Bow cannot provide. The prototype included elaborate assembly instructions and as the Edge recollects, \"one wrongly placed wire and you could get a nasty belt of electricity. This piece of gear would have failed even the most basic of safety regulations.\" On subsequent tours, his guitar technician occasionally received electric shocks from the instrument when preparing it for performances.\nListening to the backing track to \"With or Without You\" in the control room, Bono and Friday heard the sustained effect that the Edge was creating with the Infinite Guitar in the other room.

The song was released as the album's first single in December 1976 on both sides of the Atlantic. Written and sung by Lindsey Buckingham, it became the band's first top-ten hit in the United States. \"Go Your Own Way\" has been well received by music critics and was ranked number 120 by Rolling Stone magazine on their list of 500 greatest songs of all time in 2010, and re-ranked number 401 in 2021.\nRecorded in three separate studios, the track was developed over a period of four months. Like most tracks off the Rumours album, none of the instruments were recorded live together; the tracks were instead completed through a series of overdubs. Lyrically, \"Go Your Own Way\" is a breakup song, specifically directed at Buckingham's bandmate and former lover, Stevie Nicks.\n\"Go Your Own Way\" was written at a house the band rented in Florida in between legs of their Fleetwood Mac Tour. Mick Fleetwood, the band's drummer, remembered that the house had a \"distinctly bad vibe to it, as if it were haunted, which did nothing to help matters\u2026\". The first song Buckingham wrote for Rumours, Buckingham picked up an electric guitar and chugged the chord progression. In what he described as \"a stream of consciousness\", he sang the opening line, \"Loving you isn't the right thing to do\". By 1976 the romantic relationship between Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham had come to an end. While Buckingham and Nicks were still on speaking terms, their conversations often devolved into yelling and screaming matches.\nInspired by the drum feel of \"Street Fighting Man\" by The Rolling Stones, Buckingham sought to incorporate a variation of the groove in \"Go Your Own Way\". On \"Street Fighting Man\", the drumbeat alternates between the tom-tom and the snare drum, which Buckingham wanted Fleetwood to play on \"Go Your Own Way\"'s verses. Ken Caillat, Fleetwood Mac's producer, took notice of Buckingham's enthusiasm as he demonstrated the drum part he envisioned to Fleetwood. \"I remember watching him guide Mick (Fleetwood) as to what he wanted \u2013 he'd be so animated, like a little kid, playing these air tom fills with his curly hair flying. Mick wasn't so sure he could do what Lindsey wanted, but he did a great job, and the song took off.\" Fleetwood would ultimately come up with his own variation of the \"Street Fighting Man\" groove, where he played across the tom-toms while letting the bass drum play the middle beat.\nInitially, John McVie tracked a busier, and bouncier bass part that gave the song \"a country feel\". To prevent the verses from becoming too bloated, Buckingham asked him to straight eighth notes along with the rhythm guitar. Buckingham granted McVie more artistic liberty on the choruses, which he opened up with a more melodic bass line. Additional overdubs of Hammond B3 organ, electric and acoustic guitars, layered backing vocals, and assorted percussion such as the bell of a cymbal and maracas were also added to the mix. The song follows an aeolian I-VI-VII descending chord progression.\nThe band had a difficult time assembling a suitable guitar solo, so Caillat, who was away in Lake Tahoe for Christmas vacation, was called to return to Criteria Studios to finish the track. Caillat built the solo by piecing together six different lead guitar takes. He accomplished this by pulling up individual guitar solos through faders, which he would mute after bringing up the next fader. Caillat found the solo \"seamless\" despite its fragmented nature. A Shure SM57 microphone was used to capture the guitar solo in addition to some vocal tracks.\nIn the final mix, the kick drum became too overpowering at the end of the song; it created a pumping effect together with the rhythm guitar from the dynamic range compression. Producer/engineer Richard Dashut argued that they would not have encountered this \"lucky mistake\" had they mixed the song digitally.\nLike most tracks on Rumours, the lyrical content of \"Go Your Own Way\" documents personal strain in relationships between other band members. Buckingham wrote \"Go Your Own Way\" as a response to his breakup with fellow"

It is the second track on their tenth studio album, All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), and was released as the album's second single on 29 January 2001. The band's lead vocalist Bono has said the song was inspired by a fictional conversation with his friend Michael Hutchence about suicide. The song peaked at number 52 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, their native Ireland and Italy, while reaching the top 10 in Australia, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Spain and the United Kingdom. In 2002, the song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" originated from a gospel-influenced chord progression that guitarist the Edge composed on a piano in a Japanese hotel room. He said: \"I suppose I was consciously looking for something in that [gospel] tradition. Having been through that whole experimentation period during Pop\u2014with techno and dance ideas and dance aesthetics\u2014it seemed like I wanted to get back to something a bit more earthy.\" During the recording sessions for All That You Can't Leave Behind, the Edge played the piano piece in a music sequencer, after which co-producer Brian Eno removed every first and second note, leaving every third note. Eno then set it into a different keyboard with extensive treatments, resulting in what the Edge called an \"otherworldly effect\" on top of his \"traditional gospel piano sequence\". Co-producer Daniel Lanois said the recorded version of the song was essentially a live take performed by the band with him and Eno. On guitar, Lanois played \"the harmony to The Edge's part\". The Edge achieved a clean guitar tone by plugging his 1950s Fender Stratocaster guitar directly into a Fender Bassman amplifier. The song ends with a \"choral chant\" written by the Edge; Lanois said they had always wanted to compose such a part before. The group tried several variations of it before settling on the version that appears on record. The vocals were sung by the Edge, Lanois, and Eno; Lanois said it was easy to imagine hiring a choir to sing the part but \"if you want it to sound like a U2 record, then you use the team\". Mick Jagger and his daughter Elizabeth recorded backing vocals for the song, although these did not make the final mix.\nU2's lead singer Bono wrote the lyrics about the suicide of his close friend Michael Hutchence, lead singer of the band INXS. The song is written in the form of an argument about suicide in which Bono tries to convince Hutchence of the act's foolishness. Bono characterised the song as a fight between friends, which he felt guilty for never having with Hutchence. As Bono said in 2005, \"It's a row between mates. You're kinda trying to wake them up out of an idea. In my case it's a row I didn't have while he was alive. I feel the biggest respect I could pay to him was not to write some stupid soppy song, so I wrote a really tough, nasty little number, slapping him around the head. And I'm sorry, but that's how it came out of me.\"\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" was released in the UK on 29 January 2001, in Australia on 12 February 2001, in the United States on 6 August 2001, and in Canada on 30 October 2001.\nThe song was performed at every show on the Elevation Tour in 2001. The song was not played again until the third leg on the Vertigo Tour in 2005 in an acoustic form by Bono and The Edge. The full band electric version was revived for the sixth leg of the Vertigo Tour in 2006. The song was performed on the U2 360\u00b0 Tour, again in an acoustic form by Bono and The Edge. The song was played five times on the Innocence + Experience Tour. These performances were by the full band and featured The Edge on the piano. The song was not performed on the Experience + Innocence Tour in 2018, but was played during many promotional shows for the Songs of Experience album. It made two appearances on The Joshua Tree Tour 2019. Both performances were in Sydney and were dedicated to Michael Hutchence.\nThree official music videos were filmed for the song. The first video (known as the US version) is directed by Joseph Kahn, features an American football game between the \"Flys\" [sic] and the \"Lemons\" filmed at the Houston Astrodome, and"

It is the third track on their fifth studio album, The Joshua Tree (1987), and was released as the album's lead single on 16 March 1987. The song was the group's most successful single at the time, becoming their first number-one hit in both the United States and Canada by topping the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks and the RPM national singles chart for one week, with a further three weeks at number two.\n\"With or Without You\" features sustained guitar parts played by guitarist the Edge with a prototype of the Infinite Guitar, along with vocals by lead singer Bono and a bassline by bassist Adam Clayton. The song originated from a demo recorded in late 1985 that the group continued to work on throughout The Joshua Tree sessions. Ostensibly a troubled love song, the track's lyrics were inspired by Bono's conflicting feelings about the lives he led as a musician and domestic man.\nCritics praised the song upon its release. It is frequently performed on the band's tours, and it has appeared on many of their compilation albums and concert films. \"With or Without You\" is U2's second most frequently covered song. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song 131st on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\nIn late 1985, U2 convened at a house that drummer Larry Mullen Jr. bought to review material the group had written during The Unforgettable Fire Tour. During this time, a rough demo of \"With or Without You\" was written, with lead vocalist Bono composing the song's chord sequence. The band continued to work on the song at STS Studios, creating many permutations of the track, but not making any progress. Guitarist the Edge considered the song at that point to be \"awful\". The track consisted of a Yamaha drum machine beat and a bass part played by bassist Adam Clayton using an Ibanez bass guitar with a short scale. According to Clayton, these early versions of the song sounded too sentimental and \"very traditional because the chords just went round and round and round\".\nThe sessions for The Joshua Tree started in earnest in 1986, and U2 were recording at the Georgian mansion Danesmoate House in Dublin. The group attempted to take the song in a different direction, although Bono was reluctant. Under the direction of co-producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, the Edge pursued more ambient guitar playing, Clayton turned up the volume on his bass, and Mullen experimented with an electronically enhanced drum kit. Despite the work they continued to put into the track, the group considered abandoning the song, as they could not find an arrangement they liked.\nBono and his friend Gavin Friday continued to work on the song after Lanois and Eno declined to do so. Bono credits Friday with rescuing the song and rearranging it, believing it could be a hit. Eno added a keyboard arpeggio, similar to the one from \"Bad\". The song's fate was still in doubt when the Edge was sent a prototype of the Infinite Guitar by Canadian musician Michael Brook, with whom he had collaborated for the Captive soundtrack. The instrument allowed sustained notes to be played, producing \"a similar effect to the E-Bow\", but with the ability to provide all the \"mid-points between no sustain and infinite sustain\" that the E-Bow cannot provide. The prototype included elaborate assembly instructions and as the Edge recollects, \"one wrongly placed wire and you could get a nasty belt of electricity. This piece of gear would have failed even the most basic of safety regulations.\" On subsequent tours, his guitar technician occasionally received electric shocks from the instrument when preparing it for performances.\nListening to the backing track to \"With or Without You\" in the control room, Bono and Friday heard the sustained effect that the Edge was creating with the Infinite Guitar in the other room. The combination of the two playing simultaneously caught their attention. According to Lanois, \"I said, 'That sounded pretty cool,' so we listened back and I said, 'Jesus, it's better than I thought.'\" The Edge immediately recorded an Infinite Guitar part in two takes. The band considers the song's recording to be one of the album sessions' breakthrough moments, as it was recorded amidst concerns that they had run out of ideas.\nEno sequenced the song's"

It is the fourth song on the band's third and final studio album, In Utero, released in September 1993. It is also Nirvana's last single release before Cobain committed suicide in 1994.\n\"Rape Me\" was released as the album's second single in December 1993, packaged as a double A-side with \"All Apologies\". The single reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\"Rape Me\" was written by Cobain on an acoustic guitar in Los Angeles in May 1991, around the time the band's second album, Nevermind, was being mixed. It was first performed live on June 18, 1991, at The Catalyst in Santa Cruz. The earliest live versions of the song featured a guitar solo instead of a bridge.\nThe song's lyrics led to controversy even before it had been officially released. The band had wanted to play \"Rape Me\" during their appearance at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, but the network believed the song was a direct attack on them, and insisted they perform their breakthrough single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" instead. The ongoing argument between MTV and Cobain escalated over the span of several days, with MTV threatening to cut Nirvana from the show, to stop playing the band's music videos, and even to boycott other artists on the band's management company, Gold Mountain. Cobain only relented after being informed that MTV would fire Amy Finnerty, an MTV employee and friend of the band's, if the band played \"Rape Me\". The band ultimately agreed to play their latest single, \"Lithium,\" but not before Cobain started playing the chords and singing the opening lines of \"Rape Me,\" which resulted in the live broadcast almost going to commercial.\n\"Rape Me\" was first recorded in the studio in October 1992, during a two-day demo session with Jack Endino at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington. Two takes of the song were recorded, one of which was instrumental, the other featuring lead vocals by Cobain and backing vocals by drummer Dave Grohl. Cobain was holding his then-infant daughter Frances Bean Cobain on his lap when he recorded his vocals, and she can be heard crying on the demo.\nThe final studio version of \"Rape Me\" was recorded in February 1993 by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, for the band's third and final studio album, In Utero. The instruments for the song were recorded on February 15. The following day, Cobain completed his vocals for the album during a reported six-hour session. Cobain used his Fender Jaguar guitar plugged into a Twin Reverb amp.\nOn September 25, 1993, the band performed the song, along with \"Heart-Shaped Box,\" on Saturday Night Live at NBC Studios in New York City. It was the band's first show with second guitarist Pat Smear. The song was again performed on television on February 4, 1994 for the show Nulle Part Ailleurs in Paris, France.\nThe final live performance of \"Rape Me\" was at Nirvana's last concert at Terminal 1 of Munich-Riem Airport on March 1, 1994.\n\nThe song's instrumental opening bars, which features Cobain using pick scratching while playing the verse chord progression, has led to frequent comparisons to the guitar riff of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Will Bryant of Pitchfork wrote that \"the four-chord riff that drags the song through the motions is an almost direct inversion of the famous 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' riff,\" while Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross described the song as having \"the same catchy soft/loud dynamic as \"Teen Spirit,\" which \"created a perfect Cobain aesthetic \u2013 beautiful, haunting and disturbing.\" \"Rape Me\" was written after \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" but before Nevermind had been released.\n\"Rape Me\" is an anti-rape song, written from the point of view of the victim. \"It's like she's saying, 'Rape me, go ahead, rape me, beat me,'\" Cobain told Darcey Steinke of Spin in 1993, \"'You'll never kill me. I'll survive this and I'm gonna fucking rape you one of these days and you won't even know it.'\" Gillian G. Garr described the song's lyrics as \"part submissive invitation, part"

It is the third track and the second single from the band's second studio album Nevermind, released in March 1992. It was the band's second and last American top 40 hit, reaching number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, and second UK top 10 hit, reaching number nine on the UK Singles Chart. The single reached the top 10 in eight countries and the top 40 in eleven further countries.\nThe unexpected success of the album's lead single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" drew Nirvana to mainstream success, with Nevermind being released two weeks after the single's release. Following the album's release, the band and its management company debated whether to release \"Come as You Are\" or \"In Bloom\" as the next single from the album due to Cobain's concerns over similarity of the former with the Killing Joke song \"Eighties\" (1984). After some persuasion by the management company, Cobain agreed to release \"Come as You Are\" as the second single because of its commercial potential. Killing Joke were upset over the song, and there were rumors that a lawsuit had been filed over the song, though the suit never materialized. Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker was said to be upset about the whole situation, and he felt that Nirvana (which according to Walker denied the connection between the songs) handled the matter poorly. Similarities between \"Come as You Are\" and \"Life Goes On\" by The Damned have also been noted. \nThe music video for \"Come as You Are\" was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who drew inspiration for it from the cover artwork of Nevermind. Rolling Stone ranked \"Come as You Are\" 445th on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", and it placed 452nd on the 2010 edition of the list.\n\"Come as You Are\" was one of the few new songs Nirvana recorded onto the rehearsal tape the group sent to producer Butch Vig prior to the recording of Nevermind in 1991. The group recorded the song with Vig during album sessions at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, in early 1991. Cobain recorded his guitar solo in two takes, as well as three takes of vocals, of which the first was used. Vig then asked Cobain to double track his vocals throughout the entire song. During the harmony overdub session, Cobain accidentally sang the phrase \"And I don't have a gun\" too early, appearing the fourth time he sings the word \"memoria\" after the guitar solo. When this mistake was discovered, Cobain decided to keep it in the final recording. Vig sampled Cobain singing \"memoria\" from the middle of the song and placed it in the background of the song near the end twice. The band also performed an acoustic version of the song on MTV Unplugged on November 18, 1993. The recording later appeared on MTV Unplugged in New York in November 1994.\nThe origin of the song's title is unclear, but Charles R. Cross speculated the song may have been named after a motto used by the Morck Hotel in Cobain's hometown of Aberdeen, Washington. The Morck was one of many places Cobain stayed in after leaving home for a time while he was seventeen years old.\n\"Come as You Are\" is an alternative rock song that lasts for a duration of three minutes and thirty-eight seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a heavy rock tempo of 120 beats per minute. \"Come as You Are\" is composed in the key of E minor, while Kurt Cobain's vocal range spans one octave and one note, from a low of F\u266f\u2083 to a high of F\u266f\u2084. The song alternates between the chords of Em\u2085 and D\u2085 during the verses and E\u02e2\u1d58\u02e2\u2074 and G in the pre-chorus, while at the refrain it changes to the chord progression of A\u2013C\u2085. It begins with Cobain playing an unaccompanied guitar riff for eight seconds. Cobain used an Electro-Harmonix Small Clone guitar chorus pedal to give his instrument a \"watery\" or \"echoey\" tone during the verses and pre-choruses and as a result of which, the pedal has been associated with the song ever since. He is joined by the rest of the band for the first verse, which is moody and subdued. Once the band reaches the chorus, the song reaches full volume. The shift in"

It is the fourth song on the band's third and final studio album, In Utero, released in September 1993. It is also Nirvana's last single release before Cobain committed suicide in 1994.\n\"Rape Me\" was released as the album's second single in December 1993, packaged as a double A-side with \"All Apologies\". The single reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\"Rape Me\" was written by Cobain on an acoustic guitar in Los Angeles in May 1991, around the time the band's second album, Nevermind, was being mixed. It was first performed live on June 18, 1991, at The Catalyst in Santa Cruz. The earliest live versions of the song featured a guitar solo instead of a bridge.\nThe song's lyrics led to controversy even before it had been officially released. The band had wanted to play \"Rape Me\" during their appearance at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, but the network believed the song was a direct attack on them, and insisted they perform their breakthrough single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" instead. The ongoing argument between MTV and Cobain escalated over the span of several days, with MTV threatening to cut Nirvana from the show, to stop playing the band's music videos, and even to boycott other artists on the band's management company, Gold Mountain. Cobain only relented after being informed that MTV would fire Amy Finnerty, an MTV employee and friend of the band's, if the band played \"Rape Me\". The band ultimately agreed to play their latest single, \"Lithium,\" but not before Cobain started playing the chords and singing the opening lines of \"Rape Me,\" which resulted in the live broadcast almost going to commercial.\n\"Rape Me\" was first recorded in the studio in October 1992, during a two-day demo session with Jack Endino at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington. Two takes of the song were recorded, one of which was instrumental, the other featuring lead vocals by Cobain and backing vocals by drummer Dave Grohl. Cobain was holding his then-infant daughter Frances Bean Cobain on his lap when he recorded his vocals, and she can be heard crying on the demo.\nThe final studio version of \"Rape Me\" was recorded in February 1993 by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, for the band's third and final studio album, In Utero. The instruments for the song were recorded on February 15. The following day, Cobain completed his vocals for the album during a reported six-hour session. Cobain used his Fender Jaguar guitar plugged into a Twin Reverb amp.\nOn September 25, 1993, the band performed the song, along with \"Heart-Shaped Box,\" on Saturday Night Live at NBC Studios in New York City. It was the band's first show with second guitarist Pat Smear. The song was again performed on television on February 4, 1994 for the show Nulle Part Ailleurs in Paris, France.\nThe final live performance of \"Rape Me\" was at Nirvana's last concert at Terminal 1 of Munich-Riem Airport on March 1, 1994.\n\nThe song's instrumental opening bars, which features Cobain using pick scratching while playing the verse chord progression, has led to frequent comparisons to the guitar riff of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Will Bryant of Pitchfork wrote that \"the four-chord riff that drags the song through the motions is an almost direct inversion of the famous 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' riff,\" while Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross described the song as having \"the same catchy soft/loud dynamic as \"Teen Spirit,\" which \"created a perfect Cobain aesthetic \u2013 beautiful, haunting and disturbing.\" \"Rape Me\" was written after \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" but before Nevermind had been released.\n\"Rape Me\" is an anti-rape song, written from the point of view of the victim. \"It's like she's saying, 'Rape me, go ahead, rape me, beat me,'\" Cobain told Darcey Steinke of Spin in 1993, \"'You'll never kill me. I'll survive this and I'm gonna fucking rape you one of these days and you won't even know it.'\" Gillian G. Garr described the song's lyrics as \"part submissive invitation, part"

It is the third track from their 1993 album Zooropa and was released in June 1993 as the album's first single. The song features a monotonous mantra of \"don't\" commands spoken by guitarist the Edge amidst a backdrop of various sound effects and samples. The noisy composition and lyrical concept for \"Numb\" were inspired by the theme of sensory overload, which had prominently been incorporated into the Zoo TV Tour. Lead singer Bono and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. provided backing vocals on the track.\n\"Numb\" originated as a discarded song from the Achtung Baby recording sessions called \"Down All the Days\". While recording Zooropa, the band transformed the song with mixing assistance from co-producer Flood, the addition of keyboards and samples by co-producer Brian Eno, and the addition of the Edge's monotone vocals. The song was released as a VHS single, featuring music videos directed by Kevin Godley and Emergency Broadcast Network, respectively, but it did not attain widespread commercial success. U2 added \"Numb\" to their live set lists after resuming their Zoo TV Tour in May 1993, but like most songs on Zooropa it has never been performed live since the end of that tour.\n\"Numb\" originated as a discarded song from the Achtung Baby sessions called \"Down All the Days\" (later released in the premium editions of Achtung Baby's 20th anniversary reissue) that was recorded with producer Daniel Lanois at Berlin's Hansa Studios. The band was not fond of the track\u2014Zooropa co-producer Flood, who was engineer for the Achtung Baby sessions, said it was \"quite a ballady song and in the end it was decided that it didn't fit\" on that record. Guitarist the Edge said, \"It almost worked,\" calling it a \"quite unhinged electronic backing track with a very traditional melody and lyrics\" sung by lead vocalist Bono.\nDuring the Zooropa sessions of February\u2013May 1993, U2 revisited the song. At Windmill Lane Studios, producer Brian Eno began working with a stereo submix of the Berlin version, containing guitar, bass, bass pedals and drums, that Flood had created. Eno added about six or seven tracks of keyboards to the submix, mostly samples and strings from a Yamaha DX7 synthesiser. Some of the samples included Arabic voices and congas. According to Flood, \"The idea of his overdubs was to make up music out of non-musical noises, like loops of pieces of dialogue and video samples.\" The Edge called Eno's additions \"fantastic\".\nThe song's biggest contribution came while the band were organizing the final running order for Zooropa. The Edge spent several hours in another studio with the mix, experimenting with ideas; eventually adding vocals in a monotone, almost rapped delivery. He said that writing the lyrics \"came very quickly\", and that he wrote so many lyrics that two verses had to be cut from the song. His vocals were recorded at Westland Studios in Dublin, where the band spent one day for the album sessions. Flood subtly added gating to his voice \"to turn the level down when he wasn't singing.\" The addition of the Edge's vocals, for the most part, completed \"Numb\".\nBono and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. provided backing vocals. Flood treated Bono's vocals with heavy reverb to complement his \"falsetto soul voice\", while Mullen provided two tracks of backing vocals, one with a falsetto and one with his natural singing voice. After the vocals were overdubbed, Flood and the Edge mixed the track at Westland Studios. The Edge described it as \"a few hours' work and a lot of editing\", but said the mixing was \"the easiest thing in the world\" Flood concurred, calling the mixing \"very straightforward\". A sample of a Walkman cassette player rewinding was accidentally recorded onto the audio tapes, but the group liked the sound and looped it throughout the song. The final mix comprised about 15 or 16 audio tracks.\n\"Numb\" runs for 4:20 (4 minutes, 20 seconds). According to Hal Leonard Corporation\u2019s sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is played in common time at a tempo of 91 beats per minute. It is an industrial rock-influenced song featuring a noisy backdrop of sampled, rhythmic noises, including \"arcade sounds\", and a Walkman rewinding. One of the samples is from Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 propaganda film Triumph of the Will of a Hitler Youth boy playing a bass drum; a video clip of the sample was used as on-screen imagery during future concerts on the band's Zoo TV Tour. The Edge sings lead vocals, providing a monotone list of \"don't\" commands: \"Don't move / Don't talk out of"

It is the ninth track on the band's third and final studio album, In Utero, released in 1993. \nThe song was due to be released as the third single from In Utero in April 1994, but the single was recalled following Cobain's death the same month. The single was re-released, on limited edition 7 inch vinyl, for Record Store Day in April 2014, and charted at number 1 on the Billboard Hot Singles Sales chart.\nAccording to Michael Azerrad's 1993 Nirvana biography, Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana, \"Pennyroyal Tea\" was written by Cobain in 1990 in an Olympia, Washington apartment he shared with Nirvana drummer, Dave Grohl. \"Dave and I were screwing around on a 4-track,\" Cobain explained, \"and I wrote that song in about thirty seconds. And I sat down for like half-an-hour and wrote the lyrics and then we recorded it.\" It was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington, the show at which Nirvana also debuted their breakthrough single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Two unfinished takes, both lacking vocals, were recorded by Jack Endino on October 26, 1992, at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington.\nThe final version was recorded by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota in February, 1993, and officially released on In Utero in September, 1993. Cobain was dissatisfied with the recording, telling David Fricke in a 1993 Rolling Stone interview that the song \"was not recorded right. There is something wrong with that. That should have been recorded like Nevermind, because I know that's a strong song, a hit single. We're toying with the idea of re-recording it or remixing it.\" The song was remixed by Scott Litt, who had remixed the In Utero songs \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\" prior to the album's release, on November 22, 1993 at Bad Animals in Seattle, Washington. This version appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of In Utero, released in March 1994, and is the mix that was released as a single. It also appears on the band's two greatest hits albums, Nirvana (2002) and Icon (2010).\nOn November 18, 1993, Cobain performed a solo, acoustic version of the song during Nirvana's MTV Unplugged appearance  at Sony Music Studios in New York City. A full band version, featuring second guitarist Pat Smear, was recorded on February 4, 1994 for the television show Nulle Part Ailleurs in Paris, France.\nThe band had planned to perform the song on the UK TV show Top of the Pops later in 1994, as revealed by the discovery of a Digital Audio Tape containing three instrumental mixes of the song. The show allowed musicians to mime live vocals over pre-recorded instruments, and first featured Nirvana in November 1991, when Cobain mocked the show's format by singing \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in a lower key.\n\"Pennyroyal Tea\" was performed for the last time live at Nirvana's final concert, on March 1, 1994, at Terminal Eins in Munich, Germany.\nThe song's title refers to the tea made from boiling the leaves of the plant Mentha pulegium, or pennyroyal, which is used as an abortifacient, among other things, in traditional medicine. In Cobain's unused liner notes for In Utero, published posthumously in Journals in 2002, the entry for \"Pennyroyal Tea\" simply reads: \"herbal abortive... it doesn't work, you hippie.\"\n\nIn an interview in the October 1993 issue of Impact, Cobain gave greater insight into the song, saying that it was about a person suffering from severe depression: \nWhen I ask Cobain if 'Penny Royal Tea' is about indigestion, he half-laughs. 'Penny royal tea is a herbal abortive,' he says. 'I threw that in because I have so many friends who have tried to use that, and it never worked. The song is about a person who's beyond depressed; they're in their death bed, pretty"

It was written and produced by Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley, and Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon, with additional writing from James Fauntleroy. It was released as the third single from the album on February 24, 2014. The song is a mid-tempo pop ballad, that makes use of an acoustic guitar throughout, with its lyrics centering on the semantic field of love.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" received positive reviews from several contemporary music critics. The song's music video premiered on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on March 20, 2014. It is a mini documentary, that follows two documentary filmmakers searching for a couple that got engaged on January 12, 2014, while heading to New York City on the Long Island Rail Road train, with the man proposing to his girlfriend to \"Not a Bad Thing\". The video concludes with the filmmakers being led to several false leads, with a second part of the video to follow. Timberlake performed the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and during The 20/20 Experience World Tour. The song reached number 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Mainstream Top 40.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" was written by Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley, Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon, and James Fauntleroy. The song was produced by Timbaland, Timberlake, and Harmon. Timberlake arranged and produced his vocals, which were recorded at Larabee Studios in North Hollywood, California. Harmon provided keyboards for the song, while Elliot Ives and Timberlake played the guitar. The track was engineered by Chris Godbey, and mixed by Jimmy Douglass, Godbey and Timberlake, with assistance from Alejandro Baima, at Larabee Studios.\nRCA executives reportedly believed that \"Not a Bad Thing\" could be The 20/20 Experience \u2013 2 of 2's largest commercial success. However, they instead opted to release \"Take Back the Night\" and \"TKO\" first, to represent the album's R&B sound and distinguish \"Not a Bad Thing\" from the sonically similar \"Mirrors\". A radio edit of the song was digitally released on February 24, 2014 in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The next day, it impacted the contemporary hit radio in the United States. On March 31 was sent to US adult contemporary radio and on May 27 to its UK equivalent. \"Not a Bad Thing\" was released as a CD single in Austria, Germany and Switzerland; apart of the radio edit of the song it also featured the \"TKO (Black Friday Remix)\". \"Not a Bad Thing\" impacted the mainstream radio in Italy on June 4.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" is a mid-tempo pop ballad, with a running duration of 11 minutes and 28 seconds; the album version has an included hidden track entitled \"Pair of Wings\". Critics noted the song's resemblance to songs by former boy band NSYNC, which Timberlake had previously been a member of. and the song's focus on the theme of love. PopMatters' Brice Ezell saw \"Not a Bad Thing\" to share the same characteristics as NSYNC's 1999 \"(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You\", using the same \"emotional earnestness\" which made the latter song the \"heart-melter\" it was during its release. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times described the song as a \"dewy, blue-eyed soul number\" that was realized when Timberlake was discovering the \"emotional possibilities of his singing\" during his time with the boy band. Holly Gleason of Paste interpreted the lyrics as endorsing love, with the song contrasting the previous tracks on The 20/20 Experience\u00a0\u2013 2 of 2, celebrating the \"happily ever after trope for all its worth\".\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" received general acclaim from critics. Jeremy Thomas of 411mania.com selected \"Not a Bad Thing\" as one of the stand-out tracks from The 20/20 Experience\u00a0\u2013 2 of 2, using it as an example of a song from the album that \"has a gentle side that can be appreciated,\" noting it as a \"lovely close\" to the album. Similarly selecting the track as a stand-out, Chris Bosman of Consequence of Sound saw the song serving as the \"pitch perfect\" nostalgic track, pointing out its 'NSYNC influence. As well as depicting the latter influence, Melinda Newman of HitFix awarded the track an A grade, labeling it as a \"lovely, lilting straight-up pop tune.\" David Meller of musicOMH described the track as"

It is the fourth song on the band's third and final studio album, In Utero, released in September 1993. It is also Nirvana's last single release before Cobain committed suicide in 1994.\n\"Rape Me\" was released as the album's second single in December 1993, packaged as a double A-side with \"All Apologies\". The single reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\"Rape Me\" was written by Cobain on an acoustic guitar in Los Angeles in May 1991, around the time the band's second album, Nevermind, was being mixed. It was first performed live on June 18, 1991, at The Catalyst in Santa Cruz. The earliest live versions of the song featured a guitar solo instead of a bridge.\nThe song's lyrics led to controversy even before it had been officially released. The band had wanted to play \"Rape Me\" during their appearance at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, but the network believed the song was a direct attack on them, and insisted they perform their breakthrough single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" instead. The ongoing argument between MTV and Cobain escalated over the span of several days, with MTV threatening to cut Nirvana from the show, to stop playing the band's music videos, and even to boycott other artists on the band's management company, Gold Mountain. Cobain only relented after being informed that MTV would fire Amy Finnerty, an MTV employee and friend of the band's, if the band played \"Rape Me\". The band ultimately agreed to play their latest single, \"Lithium,\" but not before Cobain started playing the chords and singing the opening lines of \"Rape Me,\" which resulted in the live broadcast almost going to commercial.\n\"Rape Me\" was first recorded in the studio in October 1992, during a two-day demo session with Jack Endino at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington. Two takes of the song were recorded, one of which was instrumental, the other featuring lead vocals by Cobain and backing vocals by drummer Dave Grohl. Cobain was holding his then-infant daughter Frances Bean Cobain on his lap when he recorded his vocals, and she can be heard crying on the demo.\nThe final studio version of \"Rape Me\" was recorded in February 1993 by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, for the band's third and final studio album, In Utero. The instruments for the song were recorded on February 15. The following day, Cobain completed his vocals for the album during a reported six-hour session. Cobain used his Fender Jaguar guitar plugged into a Twin Reverb amp.\nOn September 25, 1993, the band performed the song, along with \"Heart-Shaped Box,\" on Saturday Night Live at NBC Studios in New York City. It was the band's first show with second guitarist Pat Smear. The song was again performed on television on February 4, 1994 for the show Nulle Part Ailleurs in Paris, France.\nThe final live performance of \"Rape Me\" was at Nirvana's last concert at Terminal 1 of Munich-Riem Airport on March 1, 1994.\n\nThe song's instrumental opening bars, which features Cobain using pick scratching while playing the verse chord progression, has led to frequent comparisons to the guitar riff of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Will Bryant of Pitchfork wrote that \"the four-chord riff that drags the song through the motions is an almost direct inversion of the famous 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' riff,\" while Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross described the song as having \"the same catchy soft/loud dynamic as \"Teen Spirit,\" which \"created a perfect Cobain aesthetic \u2013 beautiful, haunting and disturbing.\" \"Rape Me\" was written after \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" but before Nevermind had been released.\n\"Rape Me\" is an anti-rape song, written from the point of view of the victim. \"It's like she's saying, 'Rape me, go ahead, rape me, beat me,'\" Cobain told Darcey Steinke of Spin in 1993, \"'You'll never kill me. I'll survive this and I'm gonna fucking rape you one of these days and you won't even know it.'\" Gillian G. Garr described the song's lyrics as \"part submissive invitation, part"

It was released to American country radio by Black River Entertainment as the third single from her debut studio album The First Time (2015). Ballerini co-wrote the song with Forest Glen Whitehead and Jesse Lee. The track is a country pop ballad about a lost love being compared to the song's namesake as a metaphor for being immature and having a tendency to run off to his own fantasy.\n\"Peter Pan\" peaked at number one on both the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts respectively, becoming Ballerini's first to hit the top of the former, and her third consecutive on the latter chart. It makes her the first female country music artist to top both country music charts at the same time. It also made her the first female country artist since Wynonna Judd in 1992 to send their first three singles to number one. It also charted at number 35 on the Hot 100. The song was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 672,000 copies in the US as of March 2017. It achieved similar chart prominence in Canada, peaking at number four on the Canada Country chart and number 75 on the Canadian Hot 100. It garnered a Gold certification from Music Canada, denoting sales of 40,000 units in that country.\nAn accompanying music video for the song, directed by Kristin Barlowe, features Ballerini watching in terror as her boyfriend does thrill-seeking stunts in cars, motorcycles, and planes out in the Las Vegas desert. It was nominated for Video of the Year at both the 2017 Academy of Country Music and CMT Music Awards. For promotion, Ballerini first performed the song live with Nick Jonas at the Academy of Country Music Awards and would make later appearances at the 2016 Radio Disney Music Awards with Daya, Live with Kelly and Michael, the Grand Ole Opry, the 59th Annual Grammy Awards with Lukas Graham and CMT Crossroads with Halsey.\n\"Peter Pan\" is a country pop song about a lost love, who is compared to the song's namesake as a metaphor for his immaturity and tendency to run away. The ballad has been noted by critics for showcasing a greater emotional depth than Ballerini's previous releases in terms of both lyrical complexity and performance.\n\nThe staff of country music blog Taste of Country praised Ballerini's emotive performance of the song, writing that \"the singer either performs the ballad with someone in mind, or she's country music's best actress,\" and also noted that the song confirms Ballerini's talent as a songwriter. In 2017, Billboard contributor Chuck Dauphin put \"Peter Pan\" at number two on his top 10 list of Ballerini's best songs.\n\"Peter Pan\" ranked as the most-added song on country radio for the week of March 26, 2016 with 50 Mediabase-monitored stations picking up the song. It resultantly debuted at number 54 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of April 2 and peaked at number one the week of September 23, making it her third consecutive number one on that chart. A week later, it debuted at number 47 on the Hot Country Songs chart and peaked at number one the week of September 23, making it her first number one on that chart. The achievement made Ballerini the first solo female artist to top both country music charts and also send their first three singles to number one since Wynonna Judd in 1992 with \"She Is His Only Need\", \"I Saw the Light\" and \"No One Else on Earth\". On the Billboard Hot 100, the single debuted at number 92 the week of June 16. Fourteen weeks later, it peaked at number 35 the same week it topped both Country charts, and stayed on the chart for twenty weeks. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 21, 2016. The song has sold 672,000 copies in the US as of March 2017.\nIn Canada, the song debuted at number 46 on the Canada Country chart for the week of June 11, 2016 and peaked at number four the week of September 23, remaining on the chart for twenty weeks. It also debuted at number 92 on the Canadian Hot 100 the week of August 20 and reached number 75 the week of September 23, staying on the chart for ten weeks.

The song served as the album's second single on July 9, 2012 through Arista Nashville. Written by Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who previously wrote Underwood's single \"Before He Cheats\" (2007), \"Blown Away\" is a country pop song with lyrics addressing the story of a daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on the couch in the path of a tornado. Producer Mark Bright drew inspiration from 1980s music.\nUpon its release, \"Blown Away\" was met with positive reviews from music critics, who considered it to be the musical highlight of the album. The song's content and production received particular praise, as critics felt it confirmed the album's darker mood which Underwood had mentioned prior to its release. Commercially, \"Blown Away\" was successful. In the United States, it became her 13th number one hit on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, and also reached number 20 on the Hot 100. It also charted in Canada and the United Kingdom. It won several awards, including two Grammy Awards, for Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance. The song has since been certified 4x platinum by the RIAA.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Randee St. Nicholas. Underwood said that when she heard first the song, she already had ideas of a possible video for it. She wanted it to be a dark Wizard of Oz in 2012. It earned her an award for Video of the Year at the 2013 CMT Music Awards. The video was nominated for Music Video of the Year at the 2013 Country Music Association Awards. Underwood has performed \"Blown Away\" in a number of live appearances, including at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards, the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and two years in a row at the Country Music Association Awards. It was also performed as the encore of the Blown Away Tour (2012\u201313).\nAfter Underwood's Play On Tour wrapped in December 2010, she started to work on her fourth studio album, which was then untitled. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer \"took nearly a year to compile and record the songs.\" Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who previously wrote \"Before He Cheats\" for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts (2005), worked on \"Blown Away\" initially without a specific artist in mind. At first, they built the drums and the string parts that of the introduction and verses. Tompkins started playing his keyboard to find sound effects for the introduction, and ended up using one that was a thunderstorm. \"I think that's what kind of threw us into it. We just started writing it,\" he said.\nThe songwriters then came up with the first verse of the song: \"Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / Her daddy was a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down.\" Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song. As they wrote the pre-chorus line \"not enough rain in Oklahoma\", both knew that it was a Carrie Underwood song, as the singer is from that state. \"We knew if we stuck with that lyric [\"Oklahoma\"\u2014which is Carrie's home state] it was Carrie's song or maybe no one would ever record it,\" Kear commented.\nAfter the theme of the song had been established, the songwriters wanted to \"dig up as much drama as [they] could.\" Lyrically, \"Blown Away\" tells the story of a daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on the couch in the path of a tornado. Underwood revealed that \"Blown Away\" was the song that defined the direction of the album, and recalled the first time she heard the demo:\n\"I listened to it on my crappy computer speakers and then I had to go find my headphones because as soon as I listened to a few bars, I had to listen more closely and I got chills. I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It\u2019s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they [told me], 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song is never going to see the light of day.' It made me feel so good that they were thinking of me when they wrote it.\"\nAs noted by interviewer Kurt Wolff, \"the melody and overall sound of the song also stand out as something fresh and very different.\" Tompkins explained to Wolff that \"Blown Away\" was an \"attempt at"

It was made available to digital retailers on October 27, 2009, and was released as an official single on May 24, 2010. The song is the third single from Underwood's third studio album, Play On.\nUnderwood performed the song at the 2010 American Idol finale, as well as at the 2010 CMT Music Awards. \"Undo It\" has sold 1.6 million copies in the United States, making it the 7th biggest song of her career. It was also her first song to chart in Australia, peaking at Number 85.\n\"Undo It\" was ranked number 29 on Billboard's year-end charts for Top Country Songs.\nUnderwood told The Boot that the idea for the \"Undo It\" hook came accidentally. \"The guys had their guitars and they were playing something kind of bluesy, and Kara's got such a great R&B sense about her,\" she said. \"And I started, 'Na, na, na-ing' to whatever they were playing. And they were like, 'What if that was the hook?' I said, 'Aw, I don't know?' And before you knew it, we had 'Uh, uh, uh undo it.' I mean, who would have thought? How do you write that down on paper? It was something that it didn't take that long to write and it's so much fun to sing on stage, and people get into it.\"\nThe song has received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Juli Thanki of Engine 145 gave the song a thumbs-down, calling it \"a third-rate tune from Kelly Clarkson\u2019s reject pile\" and saying that it had \"deeply stupid lyrics.\" Roughstock critic Matt Bjorke rated the song two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that it had \"catchy repeatable lyrics\" but concluded his review by saying \"she can do so much better.\" In his review for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the song \"strained sassiness.\" Billboard critic Deborah Evans Price was more positive in her review, comparing it to the \"vengeful Carrie persona\" of \"Before He Cheats\" and saying that it had \"crisp, compelling\" production. Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A- calling Undo It a short, sweet, and undeniably catchy song which features both \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d drum riffs and twangy fiddle, as if those two things together are as natural as peanut butter and chocolate.\nCMT premiered the video for \"Undo It\" on May 7, 2010.  The video features shots of Underwood performing the song in concert along with shots of the background video played during the performance of the song in the Play On Tour. The video was directed by Chris Hicky.\n\"Undo It\" debuted at number 43 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of May 1, 2010. The song hit number one for the week of August 7, 2010, giving Underwood her tenth number one on this chart. The song debuted at number 86 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 before the release of her album Play On, and re-entered the chart at number 95 following its release as an official single. After performing the song on the finale of American Idol, the song rose to a new peak of number 25, becoming the second most successful single from Play On. It then rose to number 23 after performing it at the 2010 CMT Music Awards. The song became her eleventh Top 40 Hot 100 hit. The song re-entered once again at number 67 and stayed there for five more weeks before it dropped off the chart. On the week of June 27, 2011, \"Undo It\" entered the Australian Singles Chart at number 85, becoming her first entrance to the chart in her career.\nAs of October 2015, \"Undo It\" has sold 1,600,000 copies in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a promotional single (before the release of Play On):\nUnited States: 28,000\nAs a confirmed single (after the release of Play On):\nUnited States: 1,600,000\nThe song has officially been certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA.\nTrust, Gary (October 11, 2015). \"Ask Billboard: Chart Beat's 'Piano Man' Returns!\".

It was released to American country radio by Black River Entertainment as the third single from her debut studio album The First Time (2015). Ballerini co-wrote the song with Forest Glen Whitehead and Jesse Lee. The track is a country pop ballad about a lost love being compared to the song's namesake as a metaphor for being immature and having a tendency to run off to his own fantasy.\n\"Peter Pan\" peaked at number one on both the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts respectively, becoming Ballerini's first to hit the top of the former, and her third consecutive on the latter chart. It makes her the first female country music artist to top both country music charts at the same time. It also made her the first female country artist since Wynonna Judd in 1992 to send their first three singles to number one. It also charted at number 35 on the Hot 100. The song was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 672,000 copies in the US as of March 2017. It achieved similar chart prominence in Canada, peaking at number four on the Canada Country chart and number 75 on the Canadian Hot 100. It garnered a Gold certification from Music Canada, denoting sales of 40,000 units in that country.\nAn accompanying music video for the song, directed by Kristin Barlowe, features Ballerini watching in terror as her boyfriend does thrill-seeking stunts in cars, motorcycles, and planes out in the Las Vegas desert. It was nominated for Video of the Year at both the 2017 Academy of Country Music and CMT Music Awards. For promotion, Ballerini first performed the song live with Nick Jonas at the Academy of Country Music Awards and would make later appearances at the 2016 Radio Disney Music Awards with Daya, Live with Kelly and Michael, the Grand Ole Opry, the 59th Annual Grammy Awards with Lukas Graham and CMT Crossroads with Halsey.\n\"Peter Pan\" is a country pop song about a lost love, who is compared to the song's namesake as a metaphor for his immaturity and tendency to run away. The ballad has been noted by critics for showcasing a greater emotional depth than Ballerini's previous releases in terms of both lyrical complexity and performance.\n\nThe staff of country music blog Taste of Country praised Ballerini's emotive performance of the song, writing that \"the singer either performs the ballad with someone in mind, or she's country music's best actress,\" and also noted that the song confirms Ballerini's talent as a songwriter. In 2017, Billboard contributor Chuck Dauphin put \"Peter Pan\" at number two on his top 10 list of Ballerini's best songs.\n\"Peter Pan\" ranked as the most-added song on country radio for the week of March 26, 2016 with 50 Mediabase-monitored stations picking up the song. It resultantly debuted at number 54 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of April 2 and peaked at number one the week of September 23, making it her third consecutive number one on that chart. A week later, it debuted at number 47 on the Hot Country Songs chart and peaked at number one the week of September 23, making it her first number one on that chart. The achievement made Ballerini the first solo female artist to top both country music charts and also send their first three singles to number one since Wynonna Judd in 1992 with \"She Is His Only Need\", \"I Saw the Light\" and \"No One Else on Earth\". On the Billboard Hot 100, the single debuted at number 92 the week of June 16. Fourteen weeks later, it peaked at number 35 the same week it topped both Country charts, and stayed on the chart for twenty weeks. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 21, 2016. The song has sold 672,000 copies in the US as of March 2017.\nIn Canada, the song debuted at number 46 on the Canada Country chart for the week of June 11, 2016 and peaked at number four the week of September 23, remaining on the chart for twenty weeks. It also debuted at number 92 on the Canadian Hot 100 the week of August 20 and reached number 75 the week of September 23, staying on the chart for ten weeks. It was certified gold by Music Canada on September 12, 2016.\n\nA lyric video premiered on Ballerini's Vevo account on May 18, 2015. The official music video premiered on Ballerini's Vevo account"

It is the third track and the second single from the band's second studio album Nevermind, released in March 1992. It was the band's second and last American top 40 hit, reaching number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, and second UK top 10 hit, reaching number nine on the UK Singles Chart. The single reached the top 10 in eight countries and the top 40 in eleven further countries.\nThe unexpected success of the album's lead single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" drew Nirvana to mainstream success, with Nevermind being released two weeks after the single's release. Following the album's release, the band and its management company debated whether to release \"Come as You Are\" or \"In Bloom\" as the next single from the album due to Cobain's concerns over similarity of the former with the Killing Joke song \"Eighties\" (1984). After some persuasion by the management company, Cobain agreed to release \"Come as You Are\" as the second single because of its commercial potential. Killing Joke were upset over the song, and there were rumors that a lawsuit had been filed over the song, though the suit never materialized. Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker was said to be upset about the whole situation, and he felt that Nirvana (which according to Walker denied the connection between the songs) handled the matter poorly. Similarities between \"Come as You Are\" and \"Life Goes On\" by The Damned have also been noted. \nThe music video for \"Come as You Are\" was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who drew inspiration for it from the cover artwork of Nevermind. Rolling Stone ranked \"Come as You Are\" 445th on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", and it placed 452nd on the 2010 edition of the list.\n\"Come as You Are\" was one of the few new songs Nirvana recorded onto the rehearsal tape the group sent to producer Butch Vig prior to the recording of Nevermind in 1991. The group recorded the song with Vig during album sessions at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, in early 1991. Cobain recorded his guitar solo in two takes, as well as three takes of vocals, of which the first was used. Vig then asked Cobain to double track his vocals throughout the entire song. During the harmony overdub session, Cobain accidentally sang the phrase \"And I don't have a gun\" too early, appearing the fourth time he sings the word \"memoria\" after the guitar solo. When this mistake was discovered, Cobain decided to keep it in the final recording. Vig sampled Cobain singing \"memoria\" from the middle of the song and placed it in the background of the song near the end twice. The band also performed an acoustic version of the song on MTV Unplugged on November 18, 1993. The recording later appeared on MTV Unplugged in New York in November 1994.\nThe origin of the song's title is unclear, but Charles R. Cross speculated the song may have been named after a motto used by the Morck Hotel in Cobain's hometown of Aberdeen, Washington. The Morck was one of many places Cobain stayed in after leaving home for a time while he was seventeen years old.\n\"Come as You Are\" is an alternative rock song that lasts for a duration of three minutes and thirty-eight seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a heavy rock tempo of 120 beats per minute. \"Come as You Are\" is composed in the key of E minor, while Kurt Cobain's vocal range spans one octave and one note, from a low of F\u266f\u2083 to a high of F\u266f\u2084. The song alternates between the chords of Em\u2085 and D\u2085 during the verses and E\u02e2\u1d58\u02e2\u2074 and G in the pre-chorus, while at the refrain it changes to the chord progression of A\u2013C\u2085. It begins with Cobain playing an unaccompanied guitar riff for eight seconds. Cobain used an Electro-Harmonix Small Clone guitar chorus pedal to give his instrument a \"watery\" or \"echoey\" tone during the verses and pre-choruses and as a result of which, the pedal has been associated with the song ever since. He is joined by the rest of the band for the first verse, which is moody and subdued. Once the band reaches the chorus, the song reaches full volume. The shift in"

It was released as the lead single of that album. Timbaland remixed the song for his second studio album, Shock Value (2007). This version, also produced by Greg Wells, included an extra line of percussion, new backing vocals, and added sound samples, in addition to sound mixing and a few other minor changes. The guitar solo after the second verse was omitted. The song was the biggest radio airplay hit in the history of the Mainstream Top 40 chart in North America, with 10,394 plays in one week, until its record was broken by Leona Lewis's \"Bleeding Love\", which was also co-written by Tedder. The song was a major hit internationally, reaching number one in 16 countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Sweden, Turkey, and the Netherlands, as well as staying at number one for eight consecutive weeks on the Billboard Pop 100 chart. The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, staying in the top-10 for 25 weeks, and spent 13 weeks at number one in Canada.\n\"Apologize\" earned the band a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and was ranked number 50 on the list of the Billboard Hot 100's All-Time Top Songs list from the chart's first 50 years. It spent 25 consecutive weeks in the top 10, the longest stay there for any song since \"Smooth\" by Santana, which spent 30 weeks in 1999. It was also ranked number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.\nAn official video associated with the remix was filmed on September 19, 2007, and released in early October. The video premiered on VH1's Top 20 Countdown on October 27, 2007. The video was directed by Robert Hales and was shot in a recording studio showing OneRepublic performing the song. The video also includes scenes from a New Year's Eve countdown party, starring actor Brian A. Pollack. In a third version of the video, also directed by Robert Hales and associated with the remix, Timbaland is portrayed remixing the song himself. A European version of the video features clips of the film Keinohrhasen, starring Til Schweiger. A Japanese version of the video was also made available for a short time. It features the same footage as the original but has more scenes from different camera angles. It also features footage of people falling and floating in the air in slow motion. The music video currently has 417.02 million views.\n\"Apologize\" was OneRepublic's breakout hit. In the United States, \"Apologize\" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for four non-consecutive weeks, first blocked from the top spot for two weeks by Chris Brown's \"Kiss Kiss\" and then for two weeks by Alicia Keys' \"No One\". It spent 11 weeks at number three and 25 weeks inside the top 10 and peaked at number three for 10 weeks on the Hot 100 Airplay. It also topped the Billboard Pop 100 and became the third single from Shock Value to have topped the chart. It also became the album's first number-one single on the Billboard Adult Top 40. It is also the second consecutive single from Shock Value to reach number one on the US Mainstream Top 40 radio. It became only the tenth song to sell over 5 million by May 2011 in the US. As of February 2014, it had sold 5,819,000 copies. In late 2009, the song was ranked in 10th place on the Billboard Hot 100 Decade-End chart, making it the highest-ranking song and the only top-10 ranking song on there to not top the weekly Billboard Hot 100 chart.\nIn the UK, \"Apologize\" climbed to number 32 on the strength of digital downloads alone, and peaked at number three. The song spent 28 consecutive weeks in the top 40 and 13 weeks in the top 10. The song ended 2007 as the year's sixteenth biggest selling single in Britain. In Australia, the single debuted at number 10 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and peaked at number one. It stayed at the top for eight consecutive weeks, and was certified 4x Platinum by ARIA. The song reached number one on both the Canadian Hot 100 and New Zealand RIANZ Chart. It is the most downloaded single of all time in Australia and New Zealand. On Billboard's official European Hot 100 Singles chart, the song debuted at number 16, making it the highest debut chart position of any new act in the history of the chart.

The song was inspired by a newspaper article Vedder read about Jeremy Wade Delle, a high school student who shot himself in front of his English class on January 8, 1991. It reached the number five spot on both the Mainstream and Modern Rock Billboard charts. It did not originally chart on the regular Billboard Hot 100 singles chart since it was not released as a commercial single in the US at the time, but a re-release in July 1995 brought it up to number 79.\nThe song gained popularity for its music video, directed by Mark Pellington and released in 1992, which received heavy rotation by MTV and became a hit. The original music video for \"Jeremy\" was directed and produced by Chris Cuffaro. Epic Records and MTV later rejected the music video, and released the version directed by Pellington instead.  In 1993, the \"Jeremy\" video was awarded four MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Video of the Year.\n\"Jeremy\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by bassist Jeff Ament. The song's music was written before the band went out on tour in support of Alice in Chains in February 1991.\nAment on the song:\nI already had two pieces of music that I wrote on acoustic guitar...with the idea that I would play them on a Hamer 12-string bass I had just ordered. When the bass arrived, one of [the pieces] became \"Jeremy\"...I had an idea for the outro when we were recording it the second time...I overdubbed a twelve-string bass, and we added a cello. That was big-time production, for us....Rick [Parashar]\u2019s a supertalented engineer-musician...Stone [Gossard, Pearl Jam\u2019s rhythm guitarist] was sick one day, and Ed, Rick and I conjured up the art piece that opens and closes the song. That was so fun\u2014I wanted to make a whole record like that.\nIn another interview, Ament stated:\nWe knew it was a good song, but it was tough getting it to feel right\u2014for the chorus to sit back and the outro to push over the top. The tune went from practically not making it on the record to being one of the best takes. I'm not sure if it's the best song on the album but I think it's the best take. On \"Jeremy\" I always heard this other melody in the choruses and the end, and it never sounded good on guitar or bass. So we brought in a cello player which inspired a background vocal, and those things made the song really happen. Most of the time if something doesn't work right away, I just say fuck it\u2014but this was an instance when perseverance paid off.\n\"Jeremy\" is based on two different true stories. The song takes its main inspiration from a newspaper article about a 15-year-old boy named Jeremy Wade Delle from Richardson, Texas, who shot himself in front of his teacher and his second period English class of 30 students on the morning of January 8, 1991. In a 2009 interview, Vedder said that he felt \"the need to take that small article and make something of it\u2014to give that action, to give it reaction, to give it more importance.\"\nDelle was described by schoolmates as \"real quiet\" and known for \"acting sad\". After coming into class late that morning, Delle was told to get an admittance slip from the school office. He left the classroom, and returned with a .357 Magnum revolver. Delle walked to the front of the classroom, announced \"Miss, I got what I really went for\", put the barrel of the firearm in his mouth, and pulled the trigger before his teacher or classmates could react. Lisa Moore, a schoolmate, knew Jeremy from the in-school suspension program: \"He and I would pass notes back and forth and he would talk about life and stuff,\" she said. \"He signed all of his notes, 'Write back.' But on Monday he wrote, 'Later days.' I didn't know what to make of it. But I never thought this would happen.\"\nWhen asked about the song, Vedder explained:\nIt came from a small paragraph in a paper which means you kill yourself and you make a big old sacrifice and try to get your revenge. That all you're gonna end up with is a paragraph in a newspaper. Sixty-four degrees and cloudy in a suburban neighborhood. That's the beginning of the video and that's the same thing in the end; it does nothing \u2026 nothing changes. The world goes on and you're gone. The best revenge"

It is the third track and the second single from the band's second studio album Nevermind, released in March 1992. It was the band's second and last American top 40 hit, reaching number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, and second UK top 10 hit, reaching number nine on the UK Singles Chart. The single reached the top 10 in eight countries and the top 40 in eleven further countries.\nThe unexpected success of the album's lead single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" drew Nirvana to mainstream success, with Nevermind being released two weeks after the single's release. Following the album's release, the band and its management company debated whether to release \"Come as You Are\" or \"In Bloom\" as the next single from the album due to Cobain's concerns over similarity of the former with the Killing Joke song \"Eighties\" (1984). After some persuasion by the management company, Cobain agreed to release \"Come as You Are\" as the second single because of its commercial potential. Killing Joke were upset over the song, and there were rumors that a lawsuit had been filed over the song, though the suit never materialized. Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker was said to be upset about the whole situation, and he felt that Nirvana (which according to Walker denied the connection between the songs) handled the matter poorly. Similarities between \"Come as You Are\" and \"Life Goes On\" by The Damned have also been noted. \nThe music video for \"Come as You Are\" was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who drew inspiration for it from the cover artwork of Nevermind. Rolling Stone ranked \"Come as You Are\" 445th on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", and it placed 452nd on the 2010 edition of the list.\n\"Come as You Are\" was one of the few new songs Nirvana recorded onto the rehearsal tape the group sent to producer Butch Vig prior to the recording of Nevermind in 1991. The group recorded the song with Vig during album sessions at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, in early 1991. Cobain recorded his guitar solo in two takes, as well as three takes of vocals, of which the first was used. Vig then asked Cobain to double track his vocals throughout the entire song. During the harmony overdub session, Cobain accidentally sang the phrase \"And I don't have a gun\" too early, appearing the fourth time he sings the word \"memoria\" after the guitar solo. When this mistake was discovered, Cobain decided to keep it in the final recording. Vig sampled Cobain singing \"memoria\" from the middle of the song and placed it in the background of the song near the end twice. The band also performed an acoustic version of the song on MTV Unplugged on November 18, 1993. The recording later appeared on MTV Unplugged in New York in November 1994.\nThe origin of the song's title is unclear, but Charles R. Cross speculated the song may have been named after a motto used by the Morck Hotel in Cobain's hometown of Aberdeen, Washington. The Morck was one of many places Cobain stayed in after leaving home for a time while he was seventeen years old.\n\"Come as You Are\" is an alternative rock song that lasts for a duration of three minutes and thirty-eight seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a heavy rock tempo of 120 beats per minute. \"Come as You Are\" is composed in the key of E minor, while Kurt Cobain's vocal range spans one octave and one note, from a low of F\u266f\u2083 to a high of F\u266f\u2084. The song alternates between the chords of Em\u2085 and D\u2085 during the verses and E\u02e2\u1d58\u02e2\u2074 and G in the pre-chorus, while at the refrain it changes to the chord progression of A\u2013C\u2085. It begins with Cobain playing an unaccompanied guitar riff for eight seconds. Cobain used an Electro-Harmonix Small Clone guitar chorus pedal to give his instrument a \"watery\" or \"echoey\" tone during the verses and pre-choruses and as a result of which, the pedal has been associated with the song ever since.

The single set and surpassed several sales records in the United Kingdom charts, and set a record in the United States as one of the five Beatles songs that held the top five positions in the charts simultaneously, on 4 April 1964. It remains the band's best-selling single in the United Kingdom and the top-selling single of the 1960s there by any artist.\nIn November 2004, Rolling Stone ranked \"She Loves You\" number 64 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In August 2009, at the end of its \"Beatles Weekend\", BBC Radio 2 announced that \"She Loves You\" was the Beatles' all-time best-selling single in the UK based on information compiled by the Official Charts Company.\nIn Canada, the song was included on the album Twist and Shout. In the US, it was the final song on The Beatles' Second Album.\nLennon and McCartney started composing \"She Loves You\" on 26 June 1963 after a concert at the Majestic Ballroom in Newcastle upon Tyne during their tour with Roy Orbison and Gerry and the Pacemakers. They began writing the song on the tour bus, and continued later that night at their hotel in Newcastle eventually completing it the following day at McCartney's family home in Forthlin Road, Liverpool.\nIn 2000, McCartney said the initial idea for the song began with Bobby Rydell's hit \"Forget Him\" with its call and response pattern, and that \"as often happens, you think of one song when you write another ... I'd planned an 'answering song' where a couple of us would sing 'she loves you' and the other ones would answer 'yeah yeah'. We decided that was a crummy idea but at least we then had the idea of a song called 'She Loves You'. So we sat in the hotel bedroom for a few hours and wrote it \u2013 John and I, sitting on twin beds with guitars.\" \nLike many early Beatles songs, the title of \"She Loves You\" was framed around the use of personal pronouns. But unusually for a love song, the lyrics are not about the narrator's love for someone else; instead the narrator functions as a helpful go-between for estranged lovers:\nYou think you lost your love,\n\nWell, I saw her yesterday.\n\nIt's you she's thinking of \u2013\n\nAnd she told me what to say.\n\nShe says she loves you ...\nThis idea was attributed by Lennon to McCartney in 1980: \"It was Paul's idea: instead of singing 'I love you' again, we'd have a third party. That kind of little detail is still in his work. He will write a story about someone. I'm more inclined to write about myself.\"\nLennon, being mindful of Elvis Presley's \"All Shook Up\", wanted something equally stirring: \"I don't know where the 'yeah yeah yeah' came from [but] I remember when Elvis did 'All Shook Up' it was the first time in my life that I had heard 'uh huh', 'oh yeah', and 'yeah yeah' all sung in the same song\". The song also included a number of falsetto \"wooooo\"s, which Lennon acknowledged as being inspired by the Isley Brothers' recording of \"Twist and Shout\", which the Beatles had earlier recorded, and which had also been inserted into the group's previous single, \"From Me to You\". As Lennon later said: \"We stuck it in everything\". McCartney recalls them playing the finished song on acoustic guitars to his father Jim at home immediately after the song was completed: \"We went into the living room and said 'Dad, listen to this. What do you think? And he said 'That's very nice son, but there's enough of these Americanisms around. Couldn't you sing 'She loves you, yes, yes, yes!' At which point we collapsed in a heap and said 'No, Dad, you don't quite get it!'\" EMI recording engineer Norman Smith had a somewhat similar reaction, later recounting, \"I was setting up the microphone when I first saw the lyrics on the music stand, 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah!' I thought, Oh my God, what a lyric! This is going to be one that I do not like. But when they started to sing it \u2013 bang, wow, terrific, I was up at the mixer jogging around.\"\nThe \"yeah, yeah, yeah\" refrain proved an immediate, infectious musical hook. Unusually, the song starts with the hook right away, instead of introducing it after a verse or two. \"She Loves You\" does not include a bridge, instead using the refrain to join the various verses. The chords tend to change every two measures, and the harmonic scheme is mostly"

It was sent to US contemporary hit radio on May 14, 2013, as the fourth and final single from their fourth studio album Overexposed (2012). The song was written by Adam Levine, Nathaniel Motte, Ryan Tedder and Noel Zancanella; the latter two are also the producers. \"Love Somebody\" is a dance-pop song that lyrically equates love and physical intimacy and explores \"salvation on the dance floor\".\nUpon release, the song was a respectable success on the charts and became the fourth top ten hit from the album on the Billboard Hot 100. Despite its success, the single received mixed reviews from music critics who praised its composition, linking it to the works by Coldplay, but criticized its production and Levine's vocals. Following the release of the album, due to strong digital downloads, the song peaked at number eight on the singles chart in South Korea.\nIn mid-2011, Maroon 5 started working on their fourth studio album. One of the members of the band, James Valentine spoke to Billboard and revealed their plans to release their fourth studio album in early 2012. On March 26, 2012, the band posted a video on YouTube featuring numerous scenes from the band in the studio, recording the album. On June 26, 2012, the album was released under the title Overexposed.\nThe band's lead singer Adam Levine co-wrote \"Love Somebody\" with 3OH!3 singer Nathaniel Motte, Noel Zancanella and OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder. The latter two also produced it and provided programming and keys. Tedder and Zancanella also co-wrote and co-produced another song for Overexposed titled \"Lucky Strike\". \"Love Somebody\" was engineered by Smith Carlson at the Patriot Studios in Denver and Noah \"Mailbox\" Passovoy at the Conway Studios in Los Angeles; Eric Eylands served as the engineering assistant. Serban Ghenea mixed the song at the Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach. John Hanes served as engineer for mix, while Phil Seaford as mixing assistant.\n\"Love Somebody\" is a dance-pop song with a length of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. It is set in the key of C\u266f major and its instrumentation consists of piano and guitar. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone described the song's synth hook as the Sly Stone-meets-Eurythmics. According to Chris Payne of Billboard, Tedder and Zancanella's influence is all over the song and inches through the verses \"before bubbling over just before the chorus kicks in.\" Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly in a review of the album, wrote that the song together with \"Daylight\" have \"thickly\" produced choruses. Lyrically, \"Love Somebody\" equates love and physical intimacy, with Levine singing: \"I really wanna love somebody [...] I really wanna touch somebody\". Nate Chinen of The New York Times described the lyrical theme of the song as \"a plea for salvation on the dance floor or some other horizontal surface\".\nSuzanne Byrne of RT\u00c9.ie wrote that \"Love Somebody\" alongside \"Daylight\", \"The Man Who Never Lied\" and \"Lucky Strike\" are potential single releases.

The song was released on November 8, 2012, as the third single from their fourth studio album Overexposed (2012). Lead singer, Adam Levine co-wrote and co-produced it with Max Martin and Mason \"MdL\" Levy, with additional writing from Sam Martin. The song is a soft rock ballad about realizing that one has to move on from an old relationship, but not fully wanting to leave just yet.\nThe song received a mixed reception from music critics. Some criticized Levine's vocals and called it a filler among the dance-oriented tracks on the album, while others felt a Coldplay inspiration in the end of the chorus.\n\"Daylight\" was announced as the third single taken from the band's fourth studio album Overexposed (2012). It premiered on November 8, 2012, on The Voice. \"Daylight\" was written by Adam Levine, Max Martin, Sam Martin and Mason \"MdL\" Levy, while production was handled by Levine, Martin and MdL. Levine has stated numerous times that it is his favorite track on the entire album. It is a soft rock song.\nLevine sings \"In the daylight/ We'll be on our own/ But tonight I need to hold you so close,\"  Helen Nowotnik of The Triangle analyzed that \"If 'Never Gonna Leave This Bed' and 'Must Get Out' collided into one song, it would be 'Daylight'.\" The intro is the same as the Backstreet Boys' 2005 single \"Just Want You to Know\", as noted by Cameron Adams from The Herald Sun.\nThe song features additional vocals by actress Brie Larson. During her own music career, Larson had said that Maroon 5's Adam Levine was her main inspiration.\nThe song received mixed reviews from most music critics. Cameron Adams of Herald Sun also noted that \"it sounds like Max Martin trying to write a Coldplay song by recycling his Backstreet Boys handiwork. Chris Payne wrote for Billboard that Daylight is \"a bittersweet tale that builds momentum towards one of the album's most up-tempo songs that follows it; listen closely and you might hear a Chris Martin homage in Levine's 'whoa-oh's'.\" Mesfin Fekadu from The Huffington Post also saw similarities, writing that the song \"looks like a bad Coldplay cover.\" Adam Markovitz from Entertainment Weekly agreed, calling it \"a Coldplay-ish song.\" Markovitz also wrote that the song \"has choruses so thickly produced that the only physical instrument you can reliably pick out is Levine's larynx. Not that he comes off as particularly organic either, since his voice is usually processed into a kind of high, disaffected whine \u2014 like a male Rihanna or an android castrato \u2014 that's ideal for tracing the contours of a pop hook.\" Helen Nowotnik of The Triangle thought that the song \"It's the perfect fusion of Maroon 5's old and new sounds.\"\nEvan Sawdey of PopMatters wrote the song \"is your big anthem that actually could've been a lot bigger had they not relied entirely on a thin drum palette during the chorus.\" Martyn Young from musicOMH complained that \"By far the most irritating aspect of their magpie-like approach though is the overuse of a 'Whoah, whoah, whoah' vocal which features in almost every song, including 'Daylight'.\" Robert Copsey of Digital Spy wrote that the song \"feels anonymous despite its stadium-sized chorus.\" Grace Duncan of Under the Gun called it \"watery and uninteresting, a pop song walled in by clich\u00e9d optimistic meanderings.\"\n\"Daylight\" debuted at number 70 on the ARIA Charts. \"Daylight\" is the band's thirteenth top 100 single and follows on from their last three consecutive tracks that all peaked at number 2 \u2013 \"Moves Like Jagger\" (in August, 2011), \"Payphone\" (in June, 2012) and \"One More Night\" (in August, 2012). It later climbed to number 37, on November 25, 2012. The song re-entered only on January 27, 2013, at number 19, becoming its peak position. In New Zealand, the song debuted at number 32 on the RIANZ chart week of December 24, 2012. The following week, it climbed to number 23, remaining the position for a further week. Later, it jumped to number 19, while in its fifth week, it peaked at number 11.\n\"Daylight\" debuted at number 77 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, on the week ending December 22, 2012. The same week, it also debuted on the Adult Pop Songs, at number 37. Later, the song climbed to number 58 on the Hot 100 chart, becoming the \"Greatest Gainer\", on the week ending December 29, 2012. In its third week, the song gave a climb to number 46. In its eighth week, the song jumped to number 17, while in its ninth week, it climbed to"

The song was written by Adam Levine, Nathaniel Motte, Ryan Tedder and Noel Zancanella; the latter two are also the producers. \"Love Somebody\" is a dance-pop song that lyrically equates love and physical intimacy and explores \"salvation on the dance floor\".\nUpon release, the song was a respectable success on the charts and became the fourth top ten hit from the album on the Billboard Hot 100. Despite its success, the single received mixed reviews from music critics who praised its composition, linking it to the works by Coldplay, but criticized its production and Levine's vocals. Following the release of the album, due to strong digital downloads, the song peaked at number eight on the singles chart in South Korea.\nIn mid-2011, Maroon 5 started working on their fourth studio album. One of the members of the band, James Valentine spoke to Billboard and revealed their plans to release their fourth studio album in early 2012. On March 26, 2012, the band posted a video on YouTube featuring numerous scenes from the band in the studio, recording the album. On June 26, 2012, the album was released under the title Overexposed.\nThe band's lead singer Adam Levine co-wrote \"Love Somebody\" with 3OH!3 singer Nathaniel Motte, Noel Zancanella and OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder. The latter two also produced it and provided programming and keys. Tedder and Zancanella also co-wrote and co-produced another song for Overexposed titled \"Lucky Strike\". \"Love Somebody\" was engineered by Smith Carlson at the Patriot Studios in Denver and Noah \"Mailbox\" Passovoy at the Conway Studios in Los Angeles; Eric Eylands served as the engineering assistant. Serban Ghenea mixed the song at the Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach. John Hanes served as engineer for mix, while Phil Seaford as mixing assistant.\n\"Love Somebody\" is a dance-pop song with a length of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. It is set in the key of C\u266f major and its instrumentation consists of piano and guitar. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone described the song's synth hook as the Sly Stone-meets-Eurythmics.

The song was released on June 19, 2012, as the second single from their fourth studio album Overexposed (2012). It was written by Adam Levine, Shellback, Max Martin, and Savan Kotecha, while production was handled by Shellback and Martin. It is a reggae-influenced pop song. Lyrically, it talks about not getting along with someone and hoping he only stays with her just \"one more night\". It is built upon the idea that the heart, mind, and body usually want opposing things.\nThe song received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Most of them complimented the reggae influence on the track, Levine's vocals and labeled it a \"summer catchy song\". However, some critics perceived a lack of identity and criticized the song's melody. \"One More Night\" spent nine consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The song has also been a success on the Australian Singles Chart and on the Canadian Hot 100, reaching number two and topping the New Zealand Singles Chart and the South Korean Gaon International Chart. \"One More Night\" has sold 6.9 million copies, becoming the eighth best selling song worldwide in 2012.\nA music video directed by Peter Berg, premiered on MTV on June 25, 2012. In the video, Levine becomes a boxer working to support his girlfriend and baby daughter. As he spends time training for a big fight, he struggles to stay close to his girlfriend while raising their child together. Though Levine appears determined, his girlfriend seems troubled by his bloody profession and lack of financial stability for their daughter and leaves him in the end. Maroon 5 performing with \"One More Night\" live on The Today Show, Late Show with David Letterman and the Overexposed Tour.\n\"One More Night\" was written by Adam Levine, Shellback, Max Martin, and Savan Kotecha, while production was handled by Martin and Shellback. It is a reggae-influenced pop song where the bass line in the refrain is taken from the song \"The Bed's Too Big Without You\" by The Police. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music, the song is in the key of F minor and in  time with a tempo of 93 beats per minute. It follows a chord progression of Fm\u2013E\u266d\u2013B\u266dm, and Levine's vocals span from F\u2083 to C\u2085.\nThe song's lyrics are about a man who feels guilty about staying in a relationship only for sex. The chorus finds Levine bewitched by someone he knows he shouldn't be with: \"So I cross my heart and I hope to die / That I'll only stay with you one more night / And I know I said it a million times / But I'll only stay with you one more night.\"\nThe song has received generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Bill Lamb of About.com gave the song 4 out of 5 stars, praising \"the catchy reggae-drenched musical production\" and \"Adam Levine's confident pop vocals\". However, he wrote: \"Adam Levine's singing about being guilt-ridden over his part in relationship hell above a sunny musical production is feeling somewhat like formula. However, for now, enjoy the song's simple charms, and there will be much more to examine when the album Overexposed hits stores.\" Robert Copsey of Digital Spy called it \"a bouncy, reggae-flecked midtempo with a chorus that feels reassuringly familiar.\"\nRick Florino of Artist Direct wrote a very positive review, describing the song:\nKicking off with a reggae-style guitar on 'One More Night', the album starts on a subtle yet sharp note. The push-and-pull of the tumultuous relationship described in the lyrics belies just how slick and swaggering the song's hook is. Mickey Madden's bass is tight and groovy, while James Valentine's riffing reaches its most diverse and dynamic heights yet on this offering. Matt Flynn lays down some staggering beats, and PJ Morton's keyboards color the soundscapes vibrantly. At the center of this instrumental majesty, Levine reaches another level reaching the status of legend alongside Bono and Anthony Kiedis, merging genres while effectively forging something fresh altogether.\nRobbie Daw was divided with the song, writing: \"On one hand, the employment of these slang terms du jour seem a bit of out of character for the Cali band. But then again, this album is exec-produced by Max Martin \u2013 so say hello to the new, (even more so) commercially-viable Maroon 5.\" Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music wrote a more mixed review, commenting: \"One More Night's melody can\u2019t go more than a bar or two without repeating \u2013 as if the band is worried it may forget"

The song was written by Chris DeStefano, Brett James and Priscilla Renea. It was released as the second single from Lambert's fifth studio album Platinum in advance of the album's release two weeks later. The song premiered at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards on May 18, 2014, and was released for sale the next day.\n\"Somethin' Bad\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs, becoming Underwood's thirteenth number one on the chart and Lambert's fifth. The song is the first number one by teamed-up solo women in more than two decades on this chart.\nOn December 5, 2014, the collaboration received a Grammy nomination for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.\nThe song was written by Chris DeStefano and Brett James along with Priscilla Renea while they were at a writing retreat in France for ASCAP. The song was originally intended to be a male/female duet, but was later tweaked so that it could be performed by two females.\nThe song is seen as a female take on the bro-country genre. According to Lambert, when she heard \"Somethin\u2019 Bad\", \"the song just popped,\" and it \"really struck a chord.\"  Lambert said she had wanted to do a duet with Carrie Underwood, and that \"It's been too long since two girls in our genre have come together like that, especially on a song that's kind of in your face.\" She sent Underwood an email to request a collaboration, which was accepted as they had wanted to sing together for some time.\nThe song made its debut on the 2014 Billboard Music Awards on May 18, 2014 with a performance by Lambert and Underwood. They performed the song again at the CMT Music Awards on June 4, 2014.\nThe song received generally favorable response from the critics.  Matt Bjorke of Roughstock thought the song playful, fun, and \"sure to be a fast-selling hit.\" Jason Scott of AXS called it \"a fun, beat-driven summer anthem\" and rated it four stars out of five. Taste of Country said that the song's \"ready-for-anything lyrics and the way that Lambert and Underwood belt them out with such power, make \u2018Somethin\u2019 Bad\u2019 a catchy girl-power anthem.\"\n\"Somethin' Bad\" debuted at No. 39 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart following its release for sales on May 19, 2014 (chart dated June 7, 2014).  The song debuted at No. 48 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart for the same week, before it was officially released to radio on June 16, 2014. The song also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Digital Songs chart, with 107,000 downloads sold in its first week. \"Somethin' Bad\" peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in its sixth week, becoming Underwood's 13th number one on the chart and Lambert's fifth. The same week, the song jumped to No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lambert's highest peaking song to date on that chart. It is the first No. 1 by teamed-up solo women in more than two decades on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. As of April 2015, the song has sold 1,080,000 copies in the United States.\nIn Canada, the song debuted at No. 33 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart following its first week of release.\nThe music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy and released on June 25, 2014. It features Lambert as Belle Boyd and Underwood as  Priscilla Parker, a pair of jewel thieves.  The video is presented as a trailer for a film where the pair play poker, ride Indian motorcycles and engage in a jewel heist in which they flee in a luxury Bell Helicopter.\nMiranda purchased the two Indian Motorcycles keeping one for herself, while giving the other to Carrie as a \"thank you\" for doing the song with her. Carrie tweeted a pic of her on the bike. The bikes and the helicopter were part of a product placement arrangement organized by CMS Nashville.\nAs of November 2019, the music video has accumulated over 109 million views on Vevo and was nominated for a 2014 CMA for \"Video of the Year.\"\nIn June 2016, NBC Sports announced that \"Somethin' Bad\" would form the basis of Underwood's new theme for NBC Sunday Night Football starting with the 2016 NFL season. Titled \"Oh, Sunday Night\", it replaced \"Waiting All Day for Sunday Night\", itself inspired by an existing song (Joan Jett's \"I Hate Myself for Loving You\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Bjorke (March 25, 2014). \"Story Behind The"

It was written by Ben Folds. The song is about geeks and social outcasts looking for solace in numbers in underground music and art scenes. It peaked at #37 on the UK Singles Chart. The track was #3 for the year of 1996 on Australia's Triple J Hottest 100.\nBen Folds has spoken of feeling a social outcast at times and finding it hard to make friends  as a child because his family was constantly moving. As he found initial success with the band Majosha and then forming Ben Folds Five with Darren Jessee and Robert Sledge, he began to recognize members of his audiences as similar types of outcasts. He noted that these types of people, who were in search of their own identities, would often find themselves gravitating towards the underground scenes (punk, ska, hardcore, etc.) of independent music. They would latch onto the scenes with particular fervor.\n\"Underground\" is both an ode to and castigation of these type of people, as well as the perceived notions of the underground scene looking in from the outside. As Folds says:\nIt's just exercising artistic freedom to put some different things together that I think are funny. I think it's funny to make a very happy, cabaret-sounding song about the underground of the indie rock world. I think it's funny to take those people and make them dance around like puppets and sing Bee Gees. That's part of why you write. It's the freedom to do stuff like that. If there's a statement in it at all \u2013 and it's not the heaviest song obviously \u2013 it's that the underground or indie scene or whatever you wanna call it is just a social club. It's just fun. They're not planning the next revolution. People get so fucking serious about it, but it's just like if you've got all the credit to apply for a country club, they're going to ask you the same questions.\nA catchy, raucous romp laced with falsetto, the track became the first international commercial single and first U.S. radio single from the album Ben Folds Five. It introduced the band to the world and remains the most well-known track on the album and one of the most well-known songs of the band's career, second only to \"Brick\".\nThe song was among the most popular performed at Ben Folds Five concerts. It featured a degree of audience participation, including coordinated sound effects and retorts to various lines throughout the song. Folds continues to perform the song occasionally during his solo career.\nTwo distinct edited versions of the song exist. A radio edit version appears with the original album cut on a 1995 promotional CD sent to radio programmers in the United States, as well as a CD sent to the United Kingdom for the same purpose. The radio edit version also appears on a second promotional CD for the United Kingdom released in 1996.\nThe second edited version, a shortened version of the album cut of the song, was released as a commercial CD single in the United Kingdom in April 1996 by Vital Distribution for Passenger/Caroline. This version was released on a 7\" vinyl single in the U.K. at the same time. A second 7\" vinyl single was released in the U.K. in September 1996.\nA live audio version of the song was released in August, 1996, in the United Kingdom by Vital Distribution as part of a 2-disc CD single set. Recorded August 12, 1995, at Ziggy's in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, by John Alagia and Doug Derryberry, this live version appears with the album cut of the song on the second disc of the set. The first disc of the set features the second edited studio version of the song.\nThe live audio version also appears on the 1998 compilation and rarities album Naked Baby Photos.\nA live video version, filmed in New York on June 9, 1997, for the PBS program Sessions at West 54th, appears on the 2001 music concert DVD Ben Folds Five \u2013 The Complete Sessions at West 54th.\nThe music video was directed by David Hale. It depicts the band performing in an Old West saloon as Western fighting and other hijinks occur around them.\n\nReleased in 1995 to radio programmers in the United States to promote the song and the album Ben Folds Five.

The song was released internationally the following year as the album's fifth and final single. Garbage collaborated with English trip hop musician Tricky on a new version of \"Milk\" for single release. Much media comment was made regarding a rumoured fall-out over the sessions, when it became known that Garbage produced a further mix of \"Milk\" that only incorporated Tricky's vocals from that session.\nAfter an acclaimed live performance of the new recording of \"Milk\" at the 1996 MTV Europe Music Awards, as well as winning the Best Breakthrough Act, \"Milk (The Wicked Mix feat. Tricky)\" debuted at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, outselling the previous single \"Stupid Girl\". A mix that deleted Tricky's vocal, \"Milk (The Siren mix)\", charted in Germany, Australia and New Zealand.\nIn North America, \"Milk\" was released alongside album cut \"Supervixen\" as part of a dual-single strategy to build upon the momentum built from the success of previous single \"Stupid Girl\". The single release was supported by Garbage's support slot for the Smashing Pumpkins Infinite Sadness arena tour and pre-empted the release of a home video compilation of all the band's music videos. Both \"Milk\" and \"Supervixen\" failed to chart when alternative radio chose to heavily support their soundtrack feature \"#1 Crush\" instead.\n\"Milk\" was written and recorded by the band at their own recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin during the 1994\u201395 sessions for Garbage, and was the first track that Shirley Manson wrote from scratch. Guitarist Duke Erikson had happened to walk past Manson as she strummed an acoustic guitar in their studio lounge. He thought the melody she was humming was interesting and took the idea to the rest of the band: Steve Marker and drummer Butch Vig. Within an hour, they had set up a mic in the control room, Vig programmed some drum loops, Marker played bass and Erikson fired up the mellotron. Shirley's vocal (aside from overdubs) was recorded in a single take facing the control room speakers. The main body of the song was recorded in 45 minutes. At a later point, Garbage recorded some ambient textures for the track, and even had a clarinet part recorded, but these were ultimately removed in favour of keeping the production simple. \"It just had a really beautiful kind of feeling to it\", explained Manson, \"We tried to recreate it in the booth, but it just sounded flat.\" Vig elaborated: \"When it came to mix, we just left it the way we had [originally] recorded it\".\nManson had told the rest of the band [when she joined Garbage] that she was a songwriter, but the truth was that she had little input in the songwriting team that formed the core of her previous band: \"As the lead singer, I was left most of the time with coming up with the melody and the licks,\" Manson remembered, \"\"Milk\" was obviously augmented by the rest of Garbage, but the melody and the words are mine\". She was inspired by a line in Michael Ondaatje's The Collected Works of Billy the Kid (\"her throat is a kitchen\") and alluded to it in her lyrics for the song.  Manson later described the composition was \"a seduction, almost like a siren song\", \"I really like the vulnerable and sinister side of \"Milk\". It sounds like it's an innocuous love song and it's not\" and again elaborated further: \"It's been dismissed by people as the ballad at the end of the album. To me \"Milk\" is the darkest, most hopeless of the songs. People say \"Oh, it's lovey-dovey, so therefore it's a love song\". But it's a very bleak song, it's about loss and the fear of loss; about things you can't have and things you will forever wait for.\"\nAfter Garbage's fifth single \"Stupid Girl\" had been released internationally, the band's record label were considering what the follow-up single would be; at one point \"Supervixen\", \"Fix Me Now\", and \"Milk\" were all considered. The band performed a headline concert at New York City's Roseland Ballroom in mid-April 1996 and were joined at the aftershow by English trip hop musician Tricky. The two groups hung out for the night, and decided to collaborate on a duet version of \"Milk\" featuring both Manson and Tricky on vocals. In May, the two acts spent a session in Chicago's CRC Studios working on the new recording. The session was setback with numerous glitches including a malfunctioning tape machine and a mixing console caught fire. Manson found the experience of working with a male vocalist \"enchanting and"

It was released in early 2002 by Mushroom Records as second single from the album, with the exception of North America, where Interscope issued \"Breaking Up the Girl\" instead. In the years since release, \"Cherry Lips\" has become an enduring track for the band, an alternative rock LGBTQ anthem, and after almost two decades continues to resonate, being used as the home run song of the Milwaukee Brewers and in advertisement campaigns for Microsoft's Surface Go laptop tablets.\n\"Cherry Lips\" faltered in major markets, but was a huge hit in Italy, where it had been the sound of a prominent winter marketing campaign for Breil Stones, reaching #8 on the Italian charts. Like lead single \"Androgyny\", \"Cherry Lips\" was a success in New Zealand and Australia, where it became Garbage's biggest hit single, spending five non-consecutive weeks in the top ten. \"Cherry Lips\" was ultimately certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\nAs the first Garbage single fully released in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the band donated a percentage of the royalties generated from the sales of \"Cherry Lips\" to the International Red Cross.\n\"Cherry Lips\" was written and recorded at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. Written just as Garbage were about to begin mixing their third album, \"Cherry Lips\" was a late inclusion to the album. The song began as a keyboard melody, and was originally known by the working title \"Wonderjam\". While recording the song, Steve Marker played a tuba, and recorded the output of the audio being run through a wah-wah pedal. Daniel Shulman, at the end of his second set of scheduled bass sessions for the album, quickly created a sub-hook bassline for the chorus on a Sabre bass run through an Ampeg B15 amplifier. The band was happy with the bassline and used it on the final mix of \"Cherry Lips\". Manson described \"Cherry Lips\" as \"an adrenaline rush\" and \"probably the most celebratory song we've ever written\".\nShirley Manson wrote the lyrics based loosely around two novels she had just read, Sarah and The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, written by author Laura Albert under the pseudonym of JT LeRoy. \"I took a bit of poetic license, but I wrote it for JT. It's easily the most uplifting thing we've ever done. It sounds nothing like us; it sounds like a Shangri-Las song\", Manson explained. Like the rest of the world, Manson had believed that LeRoy had been a teenage truck-stop hustler who'd escaped the streets to become a writer.

It was released as their debut single in early 1995 by Discordant, a label set up by Mushroom Records to launch the group, and Almo Sounds in North America.\n\"Vow\" was quietly licensed to a Volume magazine/CD sampler publication at the end of 1994; it was subsequently picked up and broadcast by BBC Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq and John Peel, and then playlisted by modern rock radio stations in Los Angeles and Seattle. \"Vow\" generated such significant buzz through positive reviews and word-of-mouth that it was eventually chosen as Garbage's first single release. After a low-key independent record label pressing in the United Kingdom, where it was packaged in a very limited edition logo embossed aluminium case, \"Vow\" went on to top the alternative charts in Australia and register on the Hot 100 singles chart in the United States.\nThe song began as a demo during sessions between band members Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker, and the composition finished after singer Shirley Manson joined the band. The lyrics for \"Vow\" deal with themes of revenge and retaliation, and were inspired by a newspaper article on domestic abuse. In 2007, \"Vow\" was remastered and included as the opening track on Garbage's greatest hits compilation, Absolute Garbage.\n\"Vow\" began in rough demo form in January 1994, as band members Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker performed sessions in Marker's basement recording studio and Vig and Marker's own Smart Studios business in Madison, Wisconsin. After Marker saw Shirley Manson's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes, the band invited Manson to Smart Studios to sing on a couple of tracks. After a dreadful first audition, she returned to Angelfish, which folded shortly thereafter. Manson decided to test for Garbage again, and after the successful second audition, she began to work on the then-skeletal \"Queer\" and \"Vow\". While performing \"Vow\", Manson ad-libbed the lyrics \"I can't use what I can't abuse\" and \"like Joan of Arc coming back for more\". The song is written in the key of A minor, set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 126 beats per minute. It opens with Erikson playing a guitar through a noise gate \"with a lot of echo on it\", and has a chord progression is A\u2013C-F in the verses,  D-B\u266d-A-Em-D-B\u266d-F in the bridge, and F-C-D-G in the chorus, with a segue into F# minor in the interlude.\nAccording to Vig, the inspiration for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an abusive husband, \"so we thought it would be cool to get a bit of retribution in there.\" Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a sado-masochistic couple who could not keep away from each other. Lyrically, Manson claimed \"'Vow' is about having feelings [of vengeance]. You have to face your feelings of revenge and work out why you feel that way. It's about that conundrum when you're really angry but in reality you're in a pitiful state. Angry, twisted, but deep down, vulnerable.\" During promotion for the song, Garbage joked to journalists that \"Vow\" was about John and Lorena Bobbitt.\nGarbage had not initially planned to release \"Vow\" as their first single, as a single at all, or even include it on their debut album. The band felt that \"Vow\" was not representative of the album's genre-hopping body of work, although they later came to appreciate the situation that led to the song becoming their debut. Manson declared that \"now we can do whatever and people won't know what to expect\", but if the band had instead settled for \"of the more clubby tunes\" as a single, \"we would have been pigeonholed as a dance band and that's a hard tag to shake\".\n\nMidway through the recording sessions for the band's debut album, the band's label, Mushroom Records, secured the group an inclusion on Volume, a magazine that released compilation albums. However, the deadline given for accepting a track was only three days. The only song the band had completed in any shape or form was \"Vow\". After Volume was released in December 1994, \"Vow\" began to receive radio airplay from BBC Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq, John Peel and Johnnie Walker, and record stores in the United Kingdom began to receive requests for a single that did not yet exist. Word-of-mouth on \"Vow\" took the track back to the United States, where KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and KNDD in Seattle discovered the song, and put it into"

It was released in early 2002 by Mushroom Records as second single from the album, with the exception of North America, where Interscope issued \"Breaking Up the Girl\" instead. In the years since release, \"Cherry Lips\" has become an enduring track for the band, an alternative rock LGBTQ anthem, and after almost two decades continues to resonate, being used as the home run song of the Milwaukee Brewers and in advertisement campaigns for Microsoft's Surface Go laptop tablets.\n\"Cherry Lips\" faltered in major markets, but was a huge hit in Italy, where it had been the sound of a prominent winter marketing campaign for Breil Stones, reaching #8 on the Italian charts. Like lead single \"Androgyny\", \"Cherry Lips\" was a success in New Zealand and Australia, where it became Garbage's biggest hit single, spending five non-consecutive weeks in the top ten. \"Cherry Lips\" was ultimately certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\nAs the first Garbage single fully released in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the band donated a percentage of the royalties generated from the sales of \"Cherry Lips\" to the International Red Cross.\n\"Cherry Lips\" was written and recorded at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. Written just as Garbage were about to begin mixing their third album, \"Cherry Lips\" was a late inclusion to the album. The song began as a keyboard melody, and was originally known by the working title \"Wonderjam\". While recording the song, Steve Marker played a tuba, and recorded the output of the audio being run through a wah-wah pedal. Daniel Shulman, at the end of his second set of scheduled bass sessions for the album, quickly created a sub-hook bassline for the chorus on a Sabre bass run through an Ampeg B15 amplifier. The band was happy with the bassline and used it on the final mix of \"Cherry Lips\". Manson described \"Cherry Lips\" as \"an adrenaline rush\" and \"probably the most celebratory song we've ever written\".\nShirley Manson wrote the lyrics based loosely around two novels she had just read, Sarah and The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, written by author Laura Albert under the pseudonym of JT LeRoy. \"I took a bit of poetic license, but I wrote it for JT. It's easily the most uplifting thing we've ever done. It sounds nothing like us; it sounds like a Shangri-Las song\", Manson explained. Like the rest of the world, Manson had believed that LeRoy had been a teenage truck-stop hustler who'd escaped the streets to become a writer. Manson exchanged emails with LeRoy over the course of the album sessions. \"I wanted to write an ode to transgender spirit, inspired by my interactions with this peculiar but emotionally generous creature I knew online as JT\", Manson later recalled. On the Beautiful Garbage sleeve notes, Manson dedicated \"Cherry Lips\" to \"The Terminator\", another alias of JT LeRoy.

It was originally released in Australia on 27 May 1996 as the lead single from their eponymous debut album, Savage Garden. The single reached number one in Canada for two weeks and peaked at number four in Australia and on the US Billboard Hot 100. The single also peaked at number nine in Iceland and at 11 on the UK Singles Chart. In November 1998, the single was re-released in the United Kingdom following the success of \"Truly Madly Deeply\" and \"To the Moon and Back\". This release peaked at number 12.\nAt the APRA Music Awards of 1998 it won Most Performed Australian Work Overseas. In January 2018, as part of Triple M's \"Ozzest 100\", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, the album version of the song was ranked number 87.\nThe song's lyrics refer to the attraction exerted by a person possessing strong sex appeal. They fascinate the singer and arouse his curiosity, even though he is not sure whether he needs them at all. Singer Darren Hayes described it as a song about \"being in love with a male energy\", when asked if the song had a coded gay message. The fast-paced, almost rapped vocal style verses is similar to the verses featured in Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me) by Reunion.\nIn an interview with Apple Music about their debut album, Darren Hayes also said:\n\"I have such a soft spot for this song and it just keeps coming back. It's based on a dream that I had where I fell in love with a boy. And when I woke up, I missed him. I didn't know how I would ever feel that feeling again. I had this almost beautiful melancholy, romantic grief. I remembered everything about this boy who I'd never met. The smell, the kiss, the feeling, the butterflies in my tummy, all that stuff. And so I spent about a week mourning that feeling. I used to think, 'Maybe if I go to sleep, I'll see him again.'\"\nLarry Flick from Billboard noted that the song \"has a jittery synth-pop beat reminiscent of such '80s-era Brit-pop heroes as Duran Duran.\" He added, \"Partners Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones are quite the harmonious pair, and they are photogenic enough to ensure instant teen-idol status. Top 40 programmers should waste no time in slammin' this one on the air.\"\nTwo music videos were released for the song. Both videos present Darren Hayes with long black hair.\nThe first video is a low-budget version released in 1996 for Australian markets. It showed the band performing in a room full of disco lights and Darren Hayes singing on the back of a moving vehicle.\nThe second video is a higher-budget version directed by Nigel Dick and premiered in 1997 for international markets in conjunction with the single's international release. It features the band in a stylised futuristic warehouse and recording studio. The international version was featured on the band's compilation Truly Madly Completely: The Best of Savage Garden (2005), while the Australian version was not available until the release of the compilation The Singles (2015).\n\nStandard\n\"I Want You\" \u2013 3:53\n\"Fire Inside the Man\" \u2013 4:11\nLimited edition\n\"I Want You\" (original radio version) \u2013 3:54\n\"I Want You\" (Flu Club Mix) \u2013 6:22\n\"I Want You\" (Pee Wee Club Mix) \u2013 6:30\n\"I Want You\" (Flu Radio Edit) \u2013 3:44\n\"I Want You\" (Flu Midnight Mix) \u2013 6:24\nCD (1997)\n\"I Want You\" (album version)\n\"I Want You\" (Xenomania Funky Mix)\n\"I Want You\" (Xenomania 12\" Club Mix)\n\"I Want You\" (Sharp Miami Mix)\nCassette (1997)\n\"I Want You\" (album version)\n\"Promises\"\nCD1 (1998)\n\"I Want You '98\" (Bascombe Mix)\n\"I Want You '98\" (Sash!

The song was released as the album's second single on 15 March 2009. It became the duo's breakthrough single, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Dubstep producers Skream and Skrillex both made remixes of the track. In 2011, \"In for the Kill\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.\nFrontwoman Elly Jackson told Steve Harris of Xfm radio that the song is \"about telling someone how you feel regardless of what you get back, and not waiting to find out if they want you or not.\" The track is heavily influenced by the title theme of the 1980s animated television series Pole Position, with the music video paying homage to the show as well.\n\"In for the Kill\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Digital Spy reviewer David Balls described the song as \"slightly odd, endlessly exciting\" and stated that it \"manages to sound quaintly old-school and positively futuristic all at the same time.\" Francis Jolley of Clickmusic praised it as \"80s synth pop at its most glorious\", naming it \"the most exciting single around.\" In a review for Exclaim!, Cam Lindsay wrote that the track \"features some icy, high-pitched woos from Jackson and pulse-pounding beats\" which make it sound \"delicious\". MSN Music called it a \"damn fine electro pop humdinger\" and complimented Jackson's powerful vocals which \"hit the ground running and burst with effervescence from the opening note.\"\nIn October 2011, NME placed the song at number 64 on its list of the \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\n\"In for the Kill\" debuted at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending 28 March 2009. Four weeks after its debut, the song peaked at number two with 51,724 copies sold. The single spent four consecutive weeks at number two, before falling to number three with sales of 44,310 copies. In January 2011, \"In for the Kill\" was named the 11th best-selling download in the United Kingdom of all time. The song had sold 875,523 copies in the UK as of July 2014. In Ireland, the track debuted at number 47 on 16 April 2009 and peaked at number 13, four weeks later.\n\"In for the Kill\" was less successful in continental Europe, charting at number 43 in Belgium, number 53 in Austria, number 68 in Slovakia and number 92 in Germany. It nevertheless reached number 11 in Norway, as well as number nine on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. The single debuted at number 50 in Australia on 29 June 2009, but fell off the chart the next week. On 13 July 2009 it re-entered the chart at number 46, peaking at number 36, two weeks later. In the United States, \"In for the Kill\" topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart on the issue dated 27 November 2010, becoming the duo's second number-one song on the chart after \"Bulletproof\".\nThe first music video for \"In for the Kill\" was directed by Kinga Burza and produced by Sarah Tognazzi. The 1980s-inspired video features Jackson singing the song while driving a Toyota MR2. It begins with Jackson driving down a dark road at night. At the beginning of the chorus, she puts on a pair of sunglasses, removing them at the chorus' end. During the instrumental section of the song, she waves her hand out of the car window, at which point the road ahead and the cloud-covered moon is visible. Jackson continues to drive until she comes across another version of herself standing in the middle of the road. The video concludes with Jackson driving the car, her eyes glowing white.\nA second video was released on 7 October 2010 to promote the US release of the single, featuring a slightly altered version of the song. The video was directed by LEGS and filmed at the Hotel Chelsea in New York City.\nDubstep musician Skream produced the most well-known remix of the song, titled the Let's Get Ravey remix, which was included on the CD single and digital EP. The remix was featured during the closing credits of the Entourage episode \"Hair\", originally aired 8 August 2010, as well as in television commercials for the 2009 fantasy video game Bayonetta and in the trailer for the 2012 film Dredd. It is also part of the soundtrack to Matchstick Productions' 2011 ski film Attack of la Ni\u00f1a.\nSkream's remix received positive reviews from music critics.

Written and produced by Elly Jackson and Ben Langmaid, the song was released as the album's lead single on 15 December 2008 by Kitsun\u00e9. It peaked at number 153 on the UK Singles Chart upon limited release. When re-released on 23 November 2009, the single re-entered the chart at number 129.\nJackson told The London Paper that the song is about \"having an intense moment with someone, when maybe you're watching a film or listening to music, and both of you are yearning for the other one, and it's almost painful to sit next to them.\"\n\"Quicksand\" was met with critical acclaim. Digital Spy music editor Nick Levine wrote that \"[l]ike most of the songs on their debut album, it's a winning combination of pop smarts, stifling romantic obsession and production that mixes the sounds of '82 with the sonic punch of '09.\" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian commented that \"the sparse dynamics and stabbing synthesisers of 'Quicksand' offer a reminder that not every aspect of the 80s has been mined to exhaustion in recent years.\" Peter Paphides of The Times called the song \"superb\" and added, \"Propelled along by a melody that shares some of its DNA with Prince's 'When Doves Cry', Jackson casts herself as the recipient of an overture from someone already in a relationship.\"\nJohn Murphy, writing for musicOMH, described the song as \"instantly addictive and catchy\", while stating that \"unlike a lot of electro acts out there, 'Quicksand' has real heart and emotion to it as well\u2014certainly not a case of style over substance.\" AllMusic's Heather Phares noted that the track \"uses a relentlessly tight arrangement and Jackson's frosty soulfulness to give the song's obsession a shot of excitement.\" Luke Turner of NME referred to \"Quicksand\" as \"liquid-mercury-smooth but pierced by sharp vocals.\"\nThe music video of \"Quicksand\" was directed by Kinga Burza. It was released on YouTube on 13 January 2009. The video shows Jackson on a tropical island with pineapples and the sun setting. Girls are dancing. Jackson is seen with a parrot on her shoulder, singing. It mostly features Jackson singing with the sun setting behind her.\n\nFrench 12-inch single\nA1. \"Quicksand\" (Original) \u2013 3:07\nA2. \"Quicksand\" (autoKratz Drags to Riches Mix) \u2013 4:44\nB1. \"Quicksand\" (Beni's Sinking at 1.56 Mix) \u2013 4:20\nB2. \"Quicksand\" (Chateau Marmont Remix) \u2013 3:34\nFrench digital EP\n\"Quicksand\" \u2013 3:07\n\"Quicksand\" (AutoKratz Drags to Riches Mix) \u2013 4:42\n\"Quicksand\" (Beni's Sinking at 1.56 Mix) \u2013 4:18\n\"Quicksand\" (Chateau Marmont Remix) \u2013 3:32\n\"Quicksand\" (Joe and Will Ask?

The song was released as the album's second single on 15 March 2009. It became the duo's breakthrough single, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Dubstep producers Skream and Skrillex both made remixes of the track. In 2011, \"In for the Kill\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.\nFrontwoman Elly Jackson told Steve Harris of Xfm radio that the song is \"about telling someone how you feel regardless of what you get back, and not waiting to find out if they want you or not.\" The track is heavily influenced by the title theme of the 1980s animated television series Pole Position, with the music video paying homage to the show as well.\n\"In for the Kill\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Digital Spy reviewer David Balls described the song as \"slightly odd, endlessly exciting\" and stated that it \"manages to sound quaintly old-school and positively futuristic all at the same time.\" Francis Jolley of Clickmusic praised it as \"80s synth pop at its most glorious\", naming it \"the most exciting single around.\" In a review for Exclaim!, Cam Lindsay wrote that the track \"features some icy, high-pitched woos from Jackson and pulse-pounding beats\" which make it sound \"delicious\". MSN Music called it a \"damn fine electro pop humdinger\" and complimented Jackson's powerful vocals which \"hit the ground running and burst with effervescence from the opening note.\"\nIn October 2011, NME placed the song at number 64 on its list of the \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\n\"In for the Kill\" debuted at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending 28 March 2009. Four weeks after its debut, the song peaked at number two with 51,724 copies sold. The single spent four consecutive weeks at number two, before falling to number three with sales of 44,310 copies. In January 2011, \"In for the Kill\" was named the 11th best-selling download in the United Kingdom of all time. The song had sold 875,523 copies in the UK as of July 2014. In Ireland, the track debuted at number 47 on 16 April 2009 and peaked at number 13, four weeks later.\n\"In for the Kill\" was less successful in continental Europe, charting at number 43 in Belgium, number 53 in Austria, number 68 in Slovakia and number 92 in Germany. It nevertheless reached number 11 in Norway, as well as number nine on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. The single debuted at number 50 in Australia on 29 June 2009, but fell off the chart the next week. On 13 July 2009 it re-entered the chart at number 46, peaking at number 36, two weeks later. In the United States, \"In for the Kill\" topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart on the issue dated 27 November 2010, becoming the duo's second number-one song on the chart after \"Bulletproof\".\nThe first music video for \"In for the Kill\" was directed by Kinga Burza and produced by Sarah Tognazzi. The 1980s-inspired video features Jackson singing the song while driving a Toyota MR2. It begins with Jackson driving down a dark road at night. At the beginning of the chorus, she puts on a pair of sunglasses, removing them at the chorus' end. During the instrumental section of the song, she waves her hand out of the car window, at which point the road ahead and the cloud-covered moon is visible. Jackson continues to drive until she comes across another version of herself standing in the middle of the road. The video concludes with Jackson driving the car, her eyes glowing white.\nA second video was released on 7 October 2010 to promote the US release of the single, featuring a slightly altered version of the song. The video was directed by LEGS and filmed at the Hotel Chelsea in New York City.\nDubstep musician Skream produced the most well-known remix of the song, titled the Let's Get Ravey remix, which was included on the CD single and digital EP. The remix was featured during the closing credits of the Entourage episode \"Hair\", originally aired 8 August 2010, as well as in television commercials for the 2009 fantasy video game Bayonetta and in the trailer for the 2012 film Dredd. It is also part of the soundtrack to Matchstick Productions' 2011 ski film Attack of la Ni\u00f1a.\nSkream's remix received positive reviews from music critics. The Observer reviewer Gareth Grundy called it a \"proper remix, the kind that nudges the original song into thrilling new territory.\" Cam Lindsay of Exclaim! wrote that while the original version \"features"

The lyrics were written by Barry Mason, and the music by Les Reed, who also contributed the title and theme of the song. It earned Reed and Mason the 1968 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.\nAlthough the song is a soulful number set in triple metre, the underlying genre may be considered to be a power ballad in the British ballad tradition.   Produced by Peter Sullivan, Jones's version features a big-band accompaniment set to a flamenco rhythm. The pitch of the final note is A4. Flamenco was a surprising choice, since there is no reference to Spain anywhere in the song. Possibly, it was because of similarities to the plot of \"Carmen\", in which Don Jos\u00e9 stabs Carmen to death when she tells him she is leaving him for another man.\nThe song tells the story of a man who passes his girlfriend's window and sees her inside making love to another man.  He waits outside all night, and then confronts her in the morning, only to have her laugh in his face. He stabs her to death, and then waits for the police to come break down the door and arrest him. The lyrics unfold from the killer's point of view, and are filled with his, often contradictory, emotions. He speaks of Delilah in possessive terms, but also refers to himself as her \"slave.\" He asks his dead girlfriend to \"forgive\" him, but still clearly sees himself as having been wronged by her.\nWhen Jones performed the song on The Ed Sullivan Show, the censors insisted that the line \"At break of day when the man drove away\" be changed to \"At break of day I was still 'cross the way\", as the original version implied he had spent the night with Delilah. Jones later described the change as \"such bullshit\".\nIn a two-year court case in The High Court of Justice, 1983 -M- No.1566 , Barry Mason's ex-wife Sylvan Whittingham, the daughter of Bond film Thunderball screenwriter, Jack Whittingham, claimed she had written half the lyrics of \"Delilah\" and several other songs. The legal battle that was settled out of court in 1986.\nTom Jones' recording reached No. 1 in the charts of several countries, including Germany and Switzerland. It reached No 2 in the British charts in March 1968 and was the sixth-best selling single of that year. The US Billboard chart records its highest position as 15.\n\n\n\n\n\nWelsh rugby fans have sung \"Delilah\" as an unofficial anthem since at least as early as the 1970s; it was referred to in the lyrics of one of the verses of Max Boyce's \"Hymns and Arias\": \"We sang 'Cwm Rhondda' and 'Delilah', damn they sounded both the same\". Tom Jones performed it before Wales's rugby victory over England at Wembley Stadium in 1999. As of 2003, the Welsh Rugby Union played the song in Millennium Stadium before matches; the words to the song were shown on the big screens and the crowd sang along.\nIn 2014, Dafydd Iwan, former president of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, called for Welsh rugby supporters to stop singing \"Delilah\" at matches, asserting that the song  \"trivialise[s] the idea of murdering a woman\".  Jones dismissed Iwan's claims, stating: \"I don\u2019t think [singers] are really thinking about it \u2026 If it\u2019s going to be taken literally, I think it takes the fun out of it.\" Prior to the 2016 Six Nations Championship rugby tournament, Welsh MP Chris Bryant claimed that the song was about the murder of a prostitute, and requested that the song not be sung by Welsh rugby fans as the lyrics glorify violence towards women.\nSupporters of Stoke City adopted \"Delilah\" as their club anthem in the 1990s. It was adopted by the fans after a supporter was heard singing it in a local pub. Some of the song's original lyrics were adapted for the football terraces, but the essence of the song remained the same.\nThe song featured in the 1990 film Edward Scissorhands. In the 2005 film Romance and Cigarettes, the original recording plays on a jukebox while Christopher Walken sings along and mimes the action. In the 2013 film American Hustle, the song plays at a bar while Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner sing along. The chorus of the song was referenced in the movie Hercules Returns. The song is featured prominently in the film Dream Horse.\nIn the \"Stage Fright\" episode of Only Fools and Horses, Tony Angelino, the \nSinging Dustman, is seen performing the song during his performance at the Down by the Riverside Club. As Tony suffers from rhotacism, he makes minor adaptations to the lyrics to eliminate R sounds.\nIn the"

The song first appeared on the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album in 1973. \"Bennie and the Jets\" has been one of John's most popular songs and was performed during his appearance at Live Aid.\nThe track was a massive hit in the United States and Canada, released in 1974 as an A-side and spelt 'Bennie'. In most territories the track was released as the B-side to \"Candle in the Wind\", but spelt 'Benny'. Album artwork (back-cover track listing and centre-panel design) consistently lists the song as 'Bennie' while either 'Bennie' or 'Benny' appears on the vinyl album depending on territory. The track was released as an A-side in the UK in 1976, as \"Benny and the Jets\".\nIt is ranked number 371 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\nThe song tells of \"Bennie and the Jets\", a fictional band of whom the song's narrator is a fan. In interviews, Taupin has said that the song's lyrics are a satire on the music industry of the 1970s. The greed and glitz of the early 1970s music scene is portrayed by Taupin's words:\nWe'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around,\nyou're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound.\nTaupin also goes on to describe the flashy wardrobe of \"Bennie\", the leader of the band:\nShe's got electric boots, a mohair suit\nYou know I read it in a magazine Ohh...\nProduced by Gus Dudgeon, the song was recorded during the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road sessions in France at Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville's Strawberry Studios, where John and Taupin had recorded their previous two albums, Honky Ch\u00e2teau and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player.\nJohn rarely plays the studio version of the song, and often makes subtle or even drastic changes. Live, the piano solo in the middle of the song has been played in all sorts of variations, from very close to the original to wildly improvised and extended versions, such as the elaborate version during a Central Park concert in 1980 and another memorable take on it during the \"Elton and his band\" part of the show recorded for what would become Live in Australia in December 1986. (It can be seen on various Laserdisc releases of the show.) He has also been known to end the song in a wide range of styles, including classical, swing, boogie-woogie and even using the signature five-note phrase from John Williams' score for Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\nDespite sounding as though recorded live, the song was actually recorded in studio, with live sound effects added in later. Producer Gus Dudgeon explained:\nFor some weird reason, Elton happened to have hit the opening piano chord of the song exactly one bar before the song actually started. So I was doing the mix and this chord kept coming on which you normally wouldn't expect to hear. I turned to engineer [David Hentschel] and I said, \u2018What does that remind you of? \u2026 It's the sort of thing that people do on stage just before they're going to start a song.\u2019 Just to kind of get everybody, \u2018Okay, here we go, ready?\u2019 For some reason that chord being there made me think, \u2018Maybe we should fake-live this.\u2019\nHe mixed in sounds from a 1972 performance of John in Royal Festival Hall and a 1970 Jimi Hendrix concert at the Isle of Wight. He also included a series of whistles from a live concert in Vancouver, and added hand claps and various shouts.\nThe song was the closing track on side one of the album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and John was set against releasing it as a single, believing it would fail. CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, began heavy airplay of the song and it became the #1 song in the Detroit market. This attention caused other American and Canadian Top 40 stations to add it to their playlists as well. As a result, the song peaked at #1 on the US singles chart in 1974. In the US, it was certified Gold on 8 April 1974 and Platinum on 13 September 1995 by the RIAA, and had sold 2.8 million copies by August 1976.\n\"Bennie and the Jets\" was also John's first Top 40 hit on what at the time was called the Billboard Hot Soul Singles chart, where it peaked at #15, the highest position out of the three of his singles which reached that chart. The acceptance of \"Bennie\" on R&B radio helped land John, a huge soul music fan, a guest appearance on the 17 May 1975 edition of Soul Train, where he played \"Bennie and the Jets\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom\". In Canada, it held the #1 spot on the RPM national singles chart for two weeks (13\u201320 April), becoming his"

The song was released in March 1983 as a single, which hit number one on the national Kent Music Report Singles Chart for two weeks. It was also recorded for Redgum's live album Caught in the Act (Epic Records) released in June, which stayed in the top 40 of the Kent Music Report Albums Chart for four months. Royalties for the song go to the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia. It is in the Australasian Performing Right Association's Top 30 Australian Songs of all time.\nThe song is a first-person account of a typical Australian soldier's experience in the Vietnam War, from training at a military academy in Australia to first hand exposure to military operations and combat, and ultimately his return home disillusioned and suffering from both PTSD and, it is implied, the harmful effects of Agent Orange.\nRedgum's lead vocalist-guitarist, John Schumann, wrote the song based on experiences he heard from veterans, particularly Mick Storen (his brother in-law) and Frankie Hunt. Schumann has said that \"the power derives from the detail, provided by my mate and brother-in-law, Mick Storen, who was brave and trusting enough to share his story with me.\"\nFor the live version, Schumann explained the title, \"A Walk in the Light Green\", as referring to operational patrols in areas marked light green on topographical maps, where dark green indicated thick jungle, plenty of cover and few land mines and light green indicated thinly wooded areas, little cover and a high likelihood of land mines.\nIn January 2018, as part of Triple M's \"Ozzest 100\", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, \"I Was Only 19\" was ranked number 20.\nThe Australian Vietnam Veterans' \"Welcome Home Parade\" was held in Sydney on 3 October 1987 and was followed by a concert in The Domain where Redgum's Schumann performed his song with veteran Frank Hunt on stage. From this parade, a desire for a War Memorial to commemorate Vietnam Veterans grew into fruition with the Memorial's dedication in October 1992. Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial was constructed in Anzac Parade, Canberra in 1992 and includes a \"Wall of Words\": \"Stele B, the northern or right-hand stele, is adorned with a series of 33 quotations fixed in stainless steel lettering.\" Amongst the quotations is:\nThen someone called out \"contact\" and the bloke behind me swore,\nand we hooked in there for hours, then a god-almighty roar.\nFrankie kicked a mine the day that mankind kicked the moon.\nGod help me, he was going home in June.\nA \"normal language\" explanation of each quote has been included, courtesy of the late Brigadier Alf Garland:\nThis is a quotation from the song 'I was only 19' by the Australian singing group \"Red Gum\"  [sic]. It relates to a fire fight that had lasted for some hours when an explosion occurred. \"Frankie\", one of the soldiers had kicked (tripped) a landmine. In the song he died on the same day that the US put a man on the moon for the first time. Frankie was supposed to be returning home to Australia on completion of his tour in June of that year.\nAt the 40th-year commemoration of the Battle of Long T\u1ea7n, 18 August 2006, veterans were accompanied by Australian Ambassador Bill Tweddle at the Long Tan Cross; following the commemoration, a concert was held at V\u0169ng T\u00e0u where Schumann (and The Vagabond Crew) sang \"I Was Only 19.\" He also introduced Long T\u1ea7n veteran Storen as the source for the song. For an SBS TV special Vietnam Nurses (2005), director Polly Watkins chose \"Redgum and John Schumann's song 'Only Nineteen' during the Welcome Home Parade in 1987 because it is integral to one of the nurses' stories.\" Frank Hunt provides an account of his Vietnam experiences, titled \"I Was Only Nineteen\", in Gina Lennox' book Forged by War (August 2006).\nAfter Schumann had received letters of request from active soldiers in Afghanistan and East Timor, he sought permission to visit the troops but obtained no answer. A reporter published an article on the situation, and authorities gave permission for Schumann to tour East Timor in December 2009 and entertain Australian and New Zealand troops. Between September\u2013October 2011, he played for Australian troops in Afghanistan.\nIn 2015, Lee Kernaghan recorded the song for his album Spirit of the Anzacs. That same year, the song was added to the Sounds of Australia Registry at the National Film & Sound Archive (NFSA).\nThe lyrics include words, terms and place names particular to Australia and"

                "unshown_background": ": Infobox song. caption: Original manuscript, transcribed by Christina Macpherson, c. 1895. cover: Original Waltzing Matilda manuscript.jpg. genre: Bush ballad. lyricist: Banjo Paterson. name: Waltzing Matilda. published: 1903. written: 1895. \"Waltzing Matilda\" is a song developed in the Australian style of poetry and folk music called a bush ballad. It has been described as the country's \"unofficial national anthem\".\nThe title was Australian slang for travelling on foot (waltzing) with one's belongings in a \"matilda\" (swag) slung over one's back. The song narrates the story of an itinerant worker, or \"swagman\", making a drink of billy tea at a bush camp and capturing a stray jumbuck (sheep) to eat. When the jumbuck's owner, a squatter (landowner), and three troopers (mounted policemen) pursue the swagman for theft, he declares \"You'll never catch me alive!\" and commits suicide by drowning himself in a nearby billabong (watering hole), after which his ghost haunts the site.\nThe original lyrics were written in 1895 by Australian poet Banjo Paterson, and were first published as sheet music in 1903. Extensive folklore surrounds the song and the process of its creation, to the extent that it has its own museum, the Waltzing Matilda Centre in Winton, in the Queensland outback, where Paterson wrote the lyrics. In 2012, to remind Australians of the song's significance, Winton organised the inaugural Waltzing Matilda Day to be held on 6 April, the anniversary of its first performance.\nThe song was first recorded in 1926 as performed by John Collinson and Russell Callow. In 2008, this recording of \"Waltzing Matilda\" was added to the Sounds of Australia registry in the National Film and Sound Archive, which says that there are more recordings of \"Waltzing Matilda\" than any other Australian song.\n\nThe Australian poet Banjo Paterson wrote the words to \"Waltzing Matilda\" in August 1895 while staying at Dagworth Station, a sheep and cattle station near Winton in Central West Queensland owned by the Macpherson family. The words were written to a tune played on a zither or autoharp by 31\u2011year\u2011old Christina Macpherson (1864\u20131936), one of the family members at the station.\nMacpherson had heard the tune \"The Craigielee March\" played by a military band while attending the Warrnambool steeplechase horse racing in Victoria in April 1894, and played it back by ear at Dagworth. Paterson decided that the music would be a good piece to set lyrics to, and produced the original version during the rest of his stay at the station and in Winton.\nThe march was based on the music the Scottish composer James Barr composed in 1818 for Robert Tannahill's 1806 poem \"Thou Bonnie Wood of Craigielee\". In the early 1890s it was arranged as \"The Craigielee\" march music for brass band by Australian composer Thomas Bulch.\n It has been widely accepted that \"Waltzing Matilda\" is probably based on the following story:\nIn Queensland in 1891 the Great Shearers' Strike brought the colony close to civil war and was broken only after the Premier of Queensland, Samuel Griffith, called in the military. In September 1894, some shearers at Dagworth Station were again on strike. The situation turned violent with the striking shearers firing their rifles and pistols in the air and setting fire to the woolshed at Dagworth, killing dozens of sheep. The owner of Dagworth Station and three policemen gave chase to a man named Samuel Hoffmeister, an immigrant said to have been born in Batavia also known as \"Frenchy\". Rather than be captured, Hoffmeister shot and killed himself at the 4 Mile Creek south of Kynuna at 12.30\u00a0pm on 2 September 1894.\nBob Macpherson (the brother of Christina) and Paterson are said to have taken rides together at Dagworth. Here they would probably have passed the Combo Waterhole, where Macpherson is purported to have told this story to Paterson. Although not remaining in close contact, Paterson and Christina Macpherson had different recollections of where the song was first composed- Christina said it was composed \"in Winton\" while Paterson said it was at \"Dick's Creek\" on the road to Winton. Amongst Macpherson's belongings, found after her death in 1936, was an unopened letter to a music researcher that read \"...\u00a0one day I played (from ear) a tune, which I had heard played by a band at the Races in Warrnambool\u00a0...\u00a0he [Paterson] then said he thought he could write some words to it. He then and there wrote the first verse. We tried it and thought it went well, so he then wrote the other verses.\" Similarly, in the early 1930s on ABC radio Paterson said: \"The shearers staged a strike and Macpherson's woolshed at Dagworth was burnt down and a man was picked up dead\u00a0...\u00a0Miss Macpherson used to play a little Scottish tune on a zither and I put words to it and called it Waltzing Matilda.\"\nThe song itself was first performed on 6 April 1895 by Sir Herbert Ramsay, 5th Bart., at the North Gregory Hotel in Winton, Queensland. The occasion was a banquet"

The band co-wrote the song with Josh Kear, and produced it with Paul Worley. It serves as the lead-off single and title track to their second studio album of the same name, and was first released in the US on August 11, 2009, and it features lead vocals from both Scott and Kelley. The song also served as their debut single in the UK and Europe, where it was released April 23, 2010. It won four Grammy Awards in 2011, including for Song of the Year and Record of the Year, the only country song to win both honors since \"Not Ready to Make Nice\" by the Dixie Chicks won in 2006.\nThe song spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in late 2009. Thereafter, \"Need You Now\" crossed over onto various pop and adult contemporary music charts, becoming a top five hit in Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, as well as a top ten hit in the Netherlands and Norway. The song won Single of the Year and Song of the Year at the 2010 Academy of Country Music Awards, as well as Group Video of the Year at the 2010 CMT Music Awards. For the chart week of March 30, 2010, the song became the group's highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 2, the best position for a country song by a band on that chart since Lonestar's \"Amazed\" topped the tally at the beginning of the decade. The single has been certified nine times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It's the band's only song to crack the Billboard Decade End, doing so at number 68.\nA music video was shot for the song, directed by Dave McClister. In the video the song has an extended piano intro, and features all members of the group acting out scenes related to the storyline. The song was initially released only to the country radio format in the United States and Canada on August 24, 2009, but was remixed and re-released to all other formats domestically and internationally at the beginning of 2010. The song gained prominence internationally, in Europe and South America. The trio re-recorded the song again in Simlish to accompany the release of the Sims 3 expansion pack Ambitions. By April 17, 2011, the song became the ninth most downloaded song in history, moving 5,000,000 copies, and surpassed Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\" as the most downloaded country song in history. It has since sold over 6 million copies in the US.\nThe song was used in television series such as Hellcats and The Glades. \"Need You Now\" has also been covered by several artists, including Adele with Darius Rucker, Boyce Avenue and Glee Cast. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic included the chorus in \"Polka Face\", the polka medley from his 2011 album Alpocalypse.\nThe lyrics describe placing a call to someone in the middle of the night due to being lonely and longing for companionship. Hillary Scott commented on the song, saying that \"All three of us know what it's like to get to that point where you feel lonely enough that you make a late night phone call that you very well could regret the next day.\" Charles Kelley told The Boot that the band's record executives initially had concerns regarding using the lyrics \"I'm a little drunk\", but he convinced the executives to leave the content in the song.\n\"Need You Now\" has received critical acclaim from music critics and is considered one of the best country songs of the 2000s.  It won the 2011 Grammy award for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.  The song received a \"thumbs up\" review from Jim Malec of the 9513. He said that although Charles Kelley's voice had a \"surprisingly stuffy tone,\" lead singer Hillary Scott's voice fit perfectly for \"dark\" songs like \"Need You Now.\" He said that both singers had a rawness in their voices that made the song feel \"real\". It also received a positive review from Ken Tucker of Billboard, who said, \"the song finds alto Scott trading lead vocals with a soulful Kelley, and it will connect with anyone who's ever dumped a significant other and regretted it in the early morning hours.\" Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave a positive review as well, comparing its sound favorably to that of \"I Run to You.\" He also thought the traded-off lead vocals gave the song \"more depth,\" and that Kelley and Scott sang more strongly than on the debut album.\nCritics in Europe and North America have pointed to similarities between \"Need You Now\" and \"Eye in the Sky\" by The Alan Parsons Project.

Swift wrote \"Our Song\" for a high school talent show during her freshman year; the lyrics are about a young couple using the regular events in their lives to create their own song. She persuaded Big Machine Records to include the song on her debut album because it was popular among her classmates. It was released on September 10, 2007, by Big Machine Records as the album's third single. Produced by Nathan Chapman, \"Our Song\" is an uptempo banjo-driven country track incorporating fiddles and hip hop-influenced drums.\nMusic critics lauded \"Our Song\" for Swift's songwriting craftsmanship resulting in a memorable hook that appeals to a non-country audience. The song featured on Rolling Stone's 2019 list of the best country songs by female artists since 2000. A success on country radio, the single made Swift the youngest person\u2014eighteen at the time\u2014to single-handedly write and sing a number-one single on the Hot Country Songs chart; it stayed at number one for six weeks. \"Our Song\" peaked at number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also peaked at number thirty on the Canadian Hot 100 and was certified platinum by Music Canada (MC).\nTrey Fanjoy directed the song's music video, which premiered on CMT on September 14, 2007. The video won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year at the 2008 CMT Music Awards. To promote her debut album, Swift performed the song on many television programs and at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards. She included \"Our Song\" in the set list of the Fearless Tour (2009\u20132010), her first headlining tour, and performed it on select dates of her subsequent tours including the Speak Now World Tour (2011\u20132012), the Red Tour (2013\u20132014), and the Reputation Stadium Tour (2018).\nPennsylvania-born Taylor Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at fourteen years old, in 2004, to pursue a career in country music. She signed with Sony/ATV in 2004 to become a professional songwriter, and with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country music singer. During a four-month period near the end of 2005, Swift recorded songs for her self-titled debut album with producer Nathan Chapman. By the time production wrapped, Swift had completed her freshman high school year in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The album was released on October 24, 2006, through Big Machine Records.\nSwift wrote and co-wrote all of the album's eleven tracks, including three solely written by herself. Among the three songs, \"Our Song\" is a track Swift wrote for a talent show of her freshman high school year. She conceived the song as an upbeat and relatable track to appeal to her classmates, writing it within twenty minutes. On the inspiration, Swift said: \"I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one.\" Upon receiving positive feedback from her classmates, Swift thought that \"Our Song\" had potentials to become a chart success, insisting that Big Machine Records executives include it on the final track list. She envisioned the production in hear head before approaching Chapman. Swift chose the song as the closing track on the album because the final chorus features the repeated lyric \"Play it again\", which she thought would subliminally suggest the listener replay the album.\nBig Machine Records executives chose \"Our Song\" as the third single from the album, which Swift was surprised yet glad about. The label released the song to US country radio on September 10, 2007, and as a crossover single to US pop radio on March 10, 2008, in partnership with Republic Records. \"Our Song\" was later included on the track list of the international version of Fearless, Swift's second studio album, released in March 2009. In October 2019, following the Taylor Swift masters controversy, Big Machine Records re-released \"Our Song\", along with other singles from Swift's debut album, on limited-edition vinyl.\nNarrated in first person, \"Our Song\" recalls the little moments of a young couple. The lyrics are conversational and simple, which brings forth an engaging and straightforward story line. In the first verse, the narrator and her boyfriend"

It was released on September 23, 1997 by Mercury Records Nashville as the lead single from Twain's third studio album Come On Over (1997). It was chosen as such following weeks of careful deliberation and constant reconsidering. Originally titled \"'Gol Darn Gone and Done It\", the song's title was altered because of its difficulty to pronounce.  The song regards falling in love despite numerous attempts to evade it. It is an uptempo number that prominently features fiddle. The single was later included on Twain's album Greatest Hits (2004).\nCritics favored \"Love Gets Me Every Time\"'s immaculate production. The song became a success in country radio. It topped Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart for five consecutive weeks, Twain's fifth and longest reign on the chart. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over 500,000 copies in the United States. \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" was also her seventh number-one country hit in Canada. Its music video was directed by photographer Timothy White during the photo shoot for Come On Over's album art. It features Twain in various performance scenes, along with behind-the-scenes shots. Furthermore, the song has become a staple on Twain's set lists, as it was performed live on the Come On Over, Up! and Rock This Country tours, as well as the Let's Go! residency in Las Vegas. In addition, the song was performed in an acoustic version on the Still the One residency.\n\"Love Gets Me Every Time\" was written by Twain and her then husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, and produced solely by Lange. Twain developed the song at first and brought it to Lange under the title \"'Gol Darn Gone and Done It\", which derived from a country expression Twain had heard of. The name made Lange burst in laughter when he first heard it, and the couple completed the song together. However, executives at Mercury Records Nashville were concerned that radio DJs would mispronounce the title's tongue twisting words when announcing the single. Twain concurred, and renamed it \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" instead. The track was chosen as the lead single for Come On Over after a few weeks of careful deliberation. Twain told CMT Totally in 1997, \"We had such a hard time choosing this first single. I don't know. We just ended up there. We went around in circles for weeks until we finally decided on that single. It really just felt right, and I really can't describe it any better than that. I think it's just one of those things where we had the chance to live with the options for a few weeks and everyone just ended up there. So, it just felt right. I guess we went with our gut on that one.\" A CD single, 7\" vinyl single and a cassette single were released simultaneously on September 23, 1997 in the US and Canada, featuring three versions of \"Love Gets Me Every Time\". A second CD single and vinyl single with a dance mix of the song was released on the same day. The song was later included on Twain's Greatest Hits (2004) compilation.\nReviews from critics were generally favorable. Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly believed \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" followed the successful formula of her past hits, including rich and smooth vocals and infectious superstructure. Deborah Evans Price of Billboard picked the single as having the most potential, predicting it would \"rocket up the charts\" given that Lange and Twain followed formula they created for Twain's previous album The Woman in Me (1995). Furthermore, she stated, \"The lyric is lightweight, the performance is pretty much a matter of individual taste, and, as usual, the production is the real star here.\" Matt Bjorke of About.com listed the song amongst the pros of Come On Over. While reviewing Greatest Hits, Nick Reynolds of BBC called the track \"infectiously cheerful\", and spoke of it when explaining how Twain and Lange \"raise[d] their game\" on Come On Over. \"Love Gets Me Everytime\" was awarded a BMI Country Award at the 1998 ceremony.\n\"Love Gets Me Every Time\" peaked at number four the Canadian Singles Chart, a now-defunct chart which only tracked physical single sales, and was compiled by Nielsen SoundScan and published by Jam!. \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" debuted at number 67 on RPM's airplay-measuring Canadian Country Singles chart on the week of September 22, 1997.

Swift wrote \"Our Song\" for a high school talent show during her freshman year; the lyrics are about a young couple using the regular events in their lives to create their own song. She persuaded Big Machine Records to include the song on her debut album because it was popular among her classmates. It was released on September 10, 2007, by Big Machine Records as the album's third single. Produced by Nathan Chapman, \"Our Song\" is an uptempo banjo-driven country track incorporating fiddles and hip hop-influenced drums.\nMusic critics lauded \"Our Song\" for Swift's songwriting craftsmanship resulting in a memorable hook that appeals to a non-country audience. The song featured on Rolling Stone's 2019 list of the best country songs by female artists since 2000. A success on country radio, the single made Swift the youngest person\u2014eighteen at the time\u2014to single-handedly write and sing a number-one single on the Hot Country Songs chart; it stayed at number one for six weeks. \"Our Song\" peaked at number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also peaked at number thirty on the Canadian Hot 100 and was certified platinum by Music Canada (MC).\nTrey Fanjoy directed the song's music video, which premiered on CMT on September 14, 2007. The video won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year at the 2008 CMT Music Awards. To promote her debut album, Swift performed the song on many television programs and at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards. She included \"Our Song\" in the set list of the Fearless Tour (2009\u20132010), her first headlining tour, and performed it on select dates of her subsequent tours including the Speak Now World Tour (2011\u20132012), the Red Tour (2013\u20132014), and the Reputation Stadium Tour (2018).\nPennsylvania-born Taylor Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at fourteen years old, in 2004, to pursue a career in country music. She signed with Sony/ATV in 2004 to become a professional songwriter, and with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country music singer. During a four-month period near the end of 2005, Swift recorded songs for her self-titled debut album with producer Nathan Chapman. By the time production wrapped, Swift had completed her freshman high school year in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The album was released on October 24, 2006, through Big Machine Records.\nSwift wrote and co-wrote all of the album's eleven tracks, including three solely written by herself. Among the three songs, \"Our Song\" is a track Swift wrote for a talent show of her freshman high school year. She conceived the song as an upbeat and relatable track to appeal to her classmates, writing it within twenty minutes. On the inspiration, Swift said: \"I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one.\" Upon receiving positive feedback from her classmates, Swift thought that \"Our Song\" had potentials to become a chart success, insisting that Big Machine Records executives include it on the final track list. She envisioned the production in hear head before approaching Chapman. Swift chose the song as the closing track on the album because the final chorus features the repeated lyric \"Play it again\", which she thought would subliminally suggest the listener replay the album.\nBig Machine Records executives chose \"Our Song\" as the third single from the album, which Swift was surprised yet glad about. The label released the song to US country radio on September 10, 2007, and as a crossover single to US pop radio on March 10, 2008, in partnership with Republic Records. \"Our Song\" was later included on the track list of the international version of Fearless, Swift's second studio album, released in March 2009. In October 2019, following the Taylor Swift masters controversy, Big Machine Records re-released \"Our Song\", along with other singles from Swift's debut album, on limited-edition vinyl.\nNarrated in first person, \"Our Song\" recalls the little moments of a young couple. The lyrics are conversational and simple, which brings forth an engaging and straightforward story line. In the first verse, the narrator and her boyfriend"

It was released on July 7, 1991, 51 days before the release of the band's debut album, Ten, on which \"Alive\" appears. Written by guitarist Stone Gossard, the song originated as an instrumental titled \"Dollar Short\" and was included on a demo tape circulated in hopes of finding a singer for the group. Vocalist Eddie Vedder obtained a copy of the tape and wrote lyrics that describe a somewhat fictionalized account of the time when he was told that the man he thought was his father was not actually his biological parent.\n\"Alive\" charted at number 16 in the United Kingdom and number nine in Australia. It was the first Pearl Jam song to receive a certification from the British Phonographic Industry, going Silver in August 2018 for sales and streams of over 200,000. It also reached the top 20 in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. The single was available only through import in the United States, so it was not able to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. However, the song did peak at number 16 on the Album Rock Tracks chart and number 18 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.\nRemixed versions of the song were included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, Rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003), and the 2009 Ten reissue.\nGuitarist Stone Gossard wrote the music for the song, which he titled \"Dollar Short\", in 1990 when he was still a member of Mother Love Bone. According to Gossard in an interview for Pearl Jam's VH1 Storytellers special, Mother Love Bone frontman Andrew Wood had even sung on it. After Wood died of a heroin overdose, Gossard and his bandmate Jeff Ament started playing with guitarist Mike McCready with the hope of starting a new band. \"Dollar Short\" was one of five tracks compiled onto a tape called Stone Gossard Demos '91 that Gossard, Ament, and McCready circulated in the hopes of finding a singer and drummer for the group.\nThe tape made its way into the hands of vocalist Eddie Vedder, who was working as a security guard for a petroleum company in San Diego, California, at the time. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him. \"Alive\" was the first song for which Vedder recorded vocals. Vedder mailed the tape back to Seattle. Upon hearing the tape, the band invited Vedder to come to Seattle and he was asked to join the band.\nThe band, then called Mookie Blaylock, recorded \"Alive\" during a demo session at London Bridge studio in January 1991. The version recorded during this session would later appear on the group's debut album, Ten, and on the promotional \"Alive\" EP. During album mixing sessions in England in June 1991, mixer Tim Palmer had McCready add to the song's outro solo. McCready recorded a number of attempts at the solo, and Palmer edited them into a composite version. The guitarist was unsatisfied with the result, so he made another attempt at the solo. \"He had another go at it\", Palmer recalled, \"and got it right away. There was no piecing together to do; it was one take.\"\n\"Alive\" is in the key of A major and features an extended guitar solo after its third chorus (3:38). The solo for \"Alive\", performed by McCready, was ranked number 44 on Guitar World's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\", and number 26 on Total Guitar's list of the \"100 Hottest Guitar Solos\". When interviewed about his famous solo, McCready was quick to disclaim creative credit for it, saying he basically \"copied Ace Frehley's solo from 'She', which was copied from Robby Krieger's solo in The Doors' 'Five to One'.\" Aside from that influence, it strongly highlights the influences of Jimi Hendrix on McCready's playing, including extensive wah pedal use, frequent whammy bar dips and vibrato, as well as the use of a battered Stratocaster guitar. During many live shows he has been known to break into the outro lead solo for Black Sabbath's \"War Pigs\".\nThe song is the first piece in a trilogy of songs in what Vedder later described as a \"mini-opera\" entitled Mamasan, which is composed of the songs \"Alive\", \"Once\", and \"Footsteps\". \"Alive\" tells the story of a young man discovering that the man he thought was his father is actually his stepfather, while his mother's grief leads to an incestuous relationship with the son, who strongly resembles the biological father. This leads to \"Once\" in which the man descends into madness and goes on a killing spree, and \"Footsteps\" in which the man is eventually looking back from a prison cell awaiting his execution.\n\"Alive\" has been"

Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard, \"Even Flow\" was released in 1992 as the second single from the band's debut album, Ten (1991). The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003). A remixed version of the song was included on the 2009 Ten reissue.\n\"Even Flow\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, \"I knew it was a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it.\" Drummer Dave Krusen said, \"I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation.\" He added that \"it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better.\" Guitarist Mike McCready stated, \"We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare. We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out.\"\nAn alternate version of the song was recorded with drummer Dave Abbruzzese in 1992 while the band was recording songs for the soundtrack for the 1992 film, Singles. This version was used for the music video, and was used in single releases in the United Kingdom. This version can also be found on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003).\n\"Even Flow\" was written in the key of D major, with Gossard performing his parts in open D tuning and McCready complementing it with a similar rhythm pattern in standard tuning. The recorded version of the song actually sounds slightly sharper than D major, with everything tuned up \u2014 accidentally or otherwise \u2014 around one quarter of a step. The song features a funk guitar riff by Gossard.\nMcCready on the song:\nThat's me pretending to be Stevie Ray Vaughan, and a feeble attempt at that. Stone (Gossard, Pearl Jam guitarist) wrote the riff and song; I think it's a D tuning. I just followed him in a regular pattern. I tried to steal everything I know from Stevie Ray Vaughan and put it into that song. A blatant rip-off. A tribute rip-off, if you will!\nThe vocal line that appears in the main verse begins with a very prominent tritone interval.\nThe stark lyrics by Vedder for \"Even Flow\" describe the experience of being a homeless man. The subject sleeps \"on a pillow made of concrete\" and panhandles passersby for spare change. In addition to being illiterate, he may also be mentally ill, as he \"looks insane\" when he smiles and struggles to keep coherent thoughts (\"Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies/Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away\").\nAt Pearl Jam's March 28, 1994, concert at the Bayfront Amphitheater in Miami, Vedder introduced the song by saying, \"I thought I'd throw in a bit of street education while you still have an open mind....Right across the street there's a little homeless community that lives under the bridge. You should just know that those people ain't all crazy and sometimes it's not their fault. This song is called 'Even Flow'.\"\nAt the May 12, 2008, show in Toronto, Vedder stated that the song was written under the Space Needle in Seattle. At a subsequent show in Seattle on August 8, 2018, Vedder revealed that the song was inspired by a homeless Vietnam War veteran (also named Eddie) whom he befriended while working on the band's first album. Vedder wrote the song after learning that the man had died while the band was touring.\nWhile the \"Even Flow\" single was released commercially to international markets in 1992, the commercial single was not released in the United States until June 27, 1995, and was only available as a more expensive import version beforehand. The alternate studio recording of \"Even Flow\", which was recorded in 1992 with Abbruzzese, was released as a CD single and 12-inch white vinyl in the United Kingdom. The original version was used in single releases in the United States. The song was released as a single in 1992 with a previously unreleased funk B-side titled \"Dirty Frank\", which can also be found as an extra track on European releases of"

The song was written by lead singer Jakob Dylan, and produced by T-Bone Burnett. It was released in January 1997 as the second single from the band's second studio album, Bringing Down the Horse (1996). Dylan has said that the song is about \"the death of ideas\".\nThe song is notable for being the first single to reach number one on all three of Billboard's rock airplay charts: the Modern Rock Tracks chart, the Mainstream Rock Songs chart and the Adult Alternative Songs chart. \"One Headlight\" also peaked at number one in Canada for five weeks. In 2000, the song was listed at number 58 on Rolling Stone and MTVs list of \"100 Greatest Pop Songs of All Time\".\n\"One Headlight\" won two Grammy Awards at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards, Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. The song was performed live at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards with Bruce Springsteen, where the music video was nominated four times, including for Viewer's Choice.\n\nAlthough the song did not chart on the US Billboard Hot 100 due to the chart rules at the time, it was a significant radio hit. It spent five weeks at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart and a total of 70 weeks on the chart. In March 1997, it became the first song to top all three of Billboard's rock airplay charts\u2014the Modern Rock Tracks, Mainstream Rock Songs and Adult Alternative Songs charts. In Canada, the song reached number one on the RPM Top Singles chart for five weeks and was the third-most-successful song of the year. Outside North America, the song reached number 14 in Australia and became a moderate hit in Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\"One Headlight\" (Edit) \u2013 4:38\n\"6th Avenue Heartache\" (Acoustic) \u2013 4:57\n\"Angel on My Bike\" (Live) \u2013 4:46\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Billboard number-one alternative singles of 1997\nList of number-one singles of 1997 (Canada)\n\"Ranking: Every Alternative Rock No. 1 Hit From Worst to Best\".

Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard, \"Even Flow\" was released in 1992 as the second single from the band's debut album, Ten (1991). The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003). A remixed version of the song was included on the 2009 Ten reissue.\n\"Even Flow\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, \"I knew it was a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it.\" Drummer Dave Krusen said, \"I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation.\" He added that \"it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better.\" Guitarist Mike McCready stated, \"We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare. We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out.\"\nAn alternate version of the song was recorded with drummer Dave Abbruzzese in 1992 while the band was recording songs for the soundtrack for the 1992 film, Singles. This version was used for the music video, and was used in single releases in the United Kingdom. This version can also be found on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003).\n\"Even Flow\" was written in the key of D major, with Gossard performing his parts in open D tuning and McCready complementing it with a similar rhythm pattern in standard tuning. The recorded version of the song actually sounds slightly sharper than D major, with everything tuned up \u2014 accidentally or otherwise \u2014 around one quarter of a step. The song features a funk guitar riff by Gossard.\nMcCready on the song:\nThat's me pretending to be Stevie Ray Vaughan, and a feeble attempt at that. Stone (Gossard, Pearl Jam guitarist) wrote the riff and song; I think it's a D tuning. I just followed him in a regular pattern. I tried to steal everything I know from Stevie Ray Vaughan and put it into that song. A blatant rip-off. A tribute rip-off, if you will!\nThe vocal line that appears in the main verse begins with a very prominent tritone interval.\nThe stark lyrics by Vedder for \"Even Flow\" describe the experience of being a homeless man. The subject sleeps \"on a pillow made of concrete\" and panhandles passersby for spare change. In addition to being illiterate, he may also be mentally ill, as he \"looks insane\" when he smiles and struggles to keep coherent thoughts (\"Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies/Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away\").\nAt Pearl Jam's March 28, 1994, concert at the Bayfront Amphitheater in Miami, Vedder introduced the song by saying, \"I thought I'd throw in a bit of street education while you still have an open mind....Right across the street there's a little homeless community that lives under the bridge. You should just know that those people ain't all crazy and sometimes it's not their fault. This song is called 'Even Flow'.\"\nAt the May 12, 2008, show in Toronto, Vedder stated that the song was written under the Space Needle in Seattle. At a subsequent show in Seattle on August 8, 2018, Vedder revealed that the song was inspired by a homeless Vietnam War veteran (also named Eddie) whom he befriended while working on the band's first album. Vedder wrote the song after learning that the man had died while the band was touring.\nWhile the \"Even Flow\" single was released commercially to international markets in 1992, the commercial single was not released in the United States until June 27, 1995, and was only available as a more expensive import version beforehand. The alternate studio recording of \"Even Flow\", which was recorded in 1992 with Abbruzzese, was released as a CD single and 12-inch white vinyl in the United Kingdom. The original version was used in single releases in the United States.

The song was inspired by a newspaper article Vedder read about Jeremy Wade Delle, a high school student who shot himself in front of his English class on January 8, 1991. It reached the number five spot on both the Mainstream and Modern Rock Billboard charts. It did not originally chart on the regular Billboard Hot 100 singles chart since it was not released as a commercial single in the US at the time, but a re-release in July 1995 brought it up to number 79.\nThe song gained popularity for its music video, directed by Mark Pellington and released in 1992, which received heavy rotation by MTV and became a hit. The original music video for \"Jeremy\" was directed and produced by Chris Cuffaro. Epic Records and MTV later rejected the music video, and released the version directed by Pellington instead.  In 1993, the \"Jeremy\" video was awarded four MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Video of the Year.\n\"Jeremy\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by bassist Jeff Ament. The song's music was written before the band went out on tour in support of Alice in Chains in February 1991.\nAment on the song:\nI already had two pieces of music that I wrote on acoustic guitar...with the idea that I would play them on a Hamer 12-string bass I had just ordered. When the bass arrived, one of [the pieces] became \"Jeremy\"...I had an idea for the outro when we were recording it the second time...I overdubbed a twelve-string bass, and we added a cello. That was big-time production, for us....Rick [Parashar]\u2019s a supertalented engineer-musician...Stone [Gossard, Pearl Jam\u2019s rhythm guitarist] was sick one day, and Ed, Rick and I conjured up the art piece that opens and closes the song. That was so fun\u2014I wanted to make a whole record like that.\nIn another interview, Ament stated:\nWe knew it was a good song, but it was tough getting it to feel right\u2014for the chorus to sit back and the outro to push over the top. The tune went from practically not making it on the record to being one of the best takes. I'm not sure if it's the best song on the album but I think it's the best take. On \"Jeremy\" I always heard this other melody in the choruses and the end, and it never sounded good on guitar or bass. So we brought in a cello player which inspired a background vocal, and those things made the song really happen. Most of the time if something doesn't work right away, I just say fuck it\u2014but this was an instance when perseverance paid off.\n\"Jeremy\" is based on two different true stories. The song takes its main inspiration from a newspaper article about a 15-year-old boy named Jeremy Wade Delle from Richardson, Texas, who shot himself in front of his teacher and his second period English class of 30 students on the morning of January 8, 1991. In a 2009 interview, Vedder said that he felt \"the need to take that small article and make something of it\u2014to give that action, to give it reaction, to give it more importance.\"\nDelle was described by schoolmates as \"real quiet\" and known for \"acting sad\". After coming into class late that morning, Delle was told to get an admittance slip from the school office. He left the classroom, and returned with a .357 Magnum revolver. Delle walked to the front of the classroom, announced \"Miss, I got what I really went for\", put the barrel of the firearm in his mouth, and pulled the trigger before his teacher or classmates could react. Lisa Moore, a schoolmate, knew Jeremy from the in-school suspension program: \"He and I would pass notes back and forth and he would talk about life and stuff,\" she said. \"He signed all of his notes, 'Write back.' But on Monday he wrote, 'Later days.' I didn't know what to make of it. But I never thought this would happen.\"\nWhen asked about the song, Vedder explained:\nIt came from a small paragraph in a paper which means you kill yourself and you make a big old sacrifice and try to get your revenge. That all you're gonna end up with is a paragraph in a newspaper. Sixty-four degrees and cloudy in a suburban neighborhood. That's the beginning of the video and that's the same thing in the end; it does nothing \u2026 nothing changes. The world goes on and you're gone. The best revenge"

It was written by Andy Gibson, Paul Jenkins, and Jason Sellers. It was released as the second single from Aldean's fourth album My Kinda Party, following Aldean's and Clarkson's performance on the 44th annual Country Music Association Awards on November 10, 2010, due to strong demands of radio stations, and was also included on the deluxe edition of Clarkson's fifth studio album Stronger (2011). The song contains elements of country and pop, and its lyrics speak of the difficulties of finding and maintaining love.\n\"Don't You Wanna Stay\" was met with generally favorable reviews by critics who considered the song as \"a classic power ballad\". Critics also lauded the interesting combination between Aldean's and Clarkson's voices. The song was a crossover hit, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100. It became Aldean's fifth number one single and Clarkson's first number one single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nBoth Aldean and Clarkson performed the song on several occasions, notably on the tenth season of American Idol and at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards. Footage from the Country Music Association award performance was used to comprise a music video for \"Don't You Wanna Stay\", directed by Paul Miller. The song was nominated for \"Best Country Duo/Group Performance\" at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, but lost to \"Barton Hollow\" by The Civil Wars. \"Don't You Wanna Stay\" was covered by Colton Dixon and Skylar Laine in the eleventh season of American Idol and was performed by Justin Chain and Shelbie Z in the fifth season of The Voice.\n\"Don't You Wanna Stay\" was written by Andy Gibson, Paul Jenkins and Jason Sellers. According to Sellers, they were at Jenkins' house when they started composing the song. He explained, \"We just wanted to write a love song. We had an idea of what we were targeting. We didn\u2019t write it as a duet. We wrote it, and Andy thought about recording it. After we got the song written, we played it for Jason. Jason Aldean's idea for it was to make it a duet.\" The song is the first duet that Aldean has recorded. In an interview with Nashville.com, Aldean revealed that the song was not originally presented to him as a duet. Nevertheless, he and producer Michael Knox thought the lyrics would work for two people if he could find a female artist as a duet partner. Aldean considered a number of female vocalists to record the song with, especially Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood. However, Clarkson remained as his first choice. He explained,\n\"We had the song pitched to us and originally it wasn\u2019t a duet. The more I was listening to the thing and learning the song, I realized it set itself up to be a duet if we wanted to go that route. When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to get her. I\u2019ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it.

The song is a strong electropop song. The song was written by Steve Mac and co-written by Ina Wroldsen and Rhys Barker, who has previously worked on the band's singles. The song was produced by Steve Mac. It was released onto radio station on 25 November 2009.\nThe single was released by Fascination and Polydor Records on 3 January 2010 as the second single from Wordshaker.

Tour. The band also appeared on Dancing on Ice, GMTV and Blue Peter.\nIn an interview with HitQuarters, Steve Mac described how he, Ina Wroldsen and Rhys Barker created the track together,\n\"We were searching for sounds and found the basic hook sound that's in the verse and carries all the way through. I started playing along to it and then Ina started singing along, and the song was written over that. No drums were ever put down. Once we finished writing the song together, Ina laid a guide vocal over the top of the keyboard sound and then went away and left me and Rhys to do the rest of it. So it really was built from that sound. It's an Eurythmics kind of sound.\"\nMac also acknowledged the influence of producer RedOne's work with Lady Gaga, \"There's no question that without Gaga we wouldn't be where we are at the moment, with what Red has done and how he has changed radio in America, and what's acceptable, and where dance is.\" \"Ego\" follows a chord progression of: Bm-G-D-Bm-G.\nOn 12 October 2009, \"Ego\" was revealed on BBC Radio 1 as the Saturdays' seventh official single and the second and final official single to be released from their second studio album Wordshaker which was released on the same date.

Rochelle Wiseman backed the album by saying \"We are not releasing any more singles from the album, as we want to release a new album, not because there is no more good songs on the album.\" as there were people questioning the album's songs.\nCarla Pearce of FemaleFirst mentioned that the single \"Combines infectious synthesised riffs with a thumping beat to create a riot of a track that will no doubt become another smash hit.\" Nick Levine of Digital Spy award the song 3/5 stars describing the chorus as \"catchy enough\". UpdateTheBeat stated that \"Ego\" was a \"women-empowerment\" and it has the potential to be a number-one single! They went on to say, \"The heavy beat is the first thing to strike you, as the girls warble away chanting: \"You need to have a sit down with your ego!\" If I was to describe the song in one word it would have to be- confident. Confident. CONFIDENT- oh that was three...\" They also went on to say that the girls have \"clearly matured\" and became more \"willing to be more deep in their songs\", he always stated the Vanessa stole the song with her powerful vocals. And finally stated that \"Ego\" is definitely the stand out track on the album. DirrtyRemixes.com stated that the single is \"amazing\" and \"just can't stop playing it!\" They also gave their views over the B-side, saying that the song is not the best song, but it has good potential. But the quality of \"Ego\" is amazing!\nAfter the release of the band's album, Wordshaker, \"Ego\" was known to be the stand out track and charting into the Top 100 on the UK Singles Charts, until the song was announced as a single.

It was written by Andy Gibson, Paul Jenkins, and Jason Sellers. It was released as the second single from Aldean's fourth album My Kinda Party, following Aldean's and Clarkson's performance on the 44th annual Country Music Association Awards on November 10, 2010, due to strong demands of radio stations, and was also included on the deluxe edition of Clarkson's fifth studio album Stronger (2011). The song contains elements of country and pop, and its lyrics speak of the difficulties of finding and maintaining love.\n\"Don't You Wanna Stay\" was met with generally favorable reviews by critics who considered the song as \"a classic power ballad\". Critics also lauded the interesting combination between Aldean's and Clarkson's voices. The song was a crossover hit, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100. It became Aldean's fifth number one single and Clarkson's first number one single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nBoth Aldean and Clarkson performed the song on several occasions, notably on the tenth season of American Idol and at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards. Footage from the Country Music Association award performance was used to comprise a music video for \"Don't You Wanna Stay\", directed by Paul Miller. The song was nominated for \"Best Country Duo/Group Performance\" at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, but lost to \"Barton Hollow\" by The Civil Wars. \"Don't You Wanna Stay\" was covered by Colton Dixon and Skylar Laine in the eleventh season of American Idol and was performed by Justin Chain and Shelbie Z in the fifth season of The Voice.\n\"Don't You Wanna Stay\" was written by Andy Gibson, Paul Jenkins and Jason Sellers. According to Sellers, they were at Jenkins' house when they started composing the song. He explained, \"We just wanted to write a love song. We had an idea of what we were targeting. We didn\u2019t write it as a duet. We wrote it, and Andy thought about recording it. After we got the song written, we played it for Jason. Jason Aldean's idea for it was to make it a duet.\" The song is the first duet that Aldean has recorded. In an interview with Nashville.com, Aldean revealed that the song was not originally presented to him as a duet. Nevertheless, he and producer Michael Knox thought the lyrics would work for two people if he could find a female artist as a duet partner. Aldean considered a number of female vocalists to record the song with, especially Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood. However, Clarkson remained as his first choice. He explained,\n\"We had the song pitched to us and originally it wasn\u2019t a duet. The more I was listening to the thing and learning the song, I realized it set itself up to be a duet if we wanted to go that route. When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to get her. I\u2019ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious it was going to be great.\"\nOn November\u00a010,\u00a02010, \"Don't You Wanna Stay\" was performed live for the first time by Aldean with Clarkson on the 44th Country Music Association Awards.

According to Lambert, when she heard \"Somethin\u2019 Bad\", \"the song just popped,\" and it \"really struck a chord.\"  Lambert said she had wanted to do a duet with Carrie Underwood, and that \"It's been too long since two girls in our genre have come together like that, especially on a song that's kind of in your face.\" She sent Underwood an email to request a collaboration, which was accepted as they had wanted to sing together for some time.\nThe song made its debut on the 2014 Billboard Music Awards on May 18, 2014 with a performance by Lambert and Underwood. They performed the song again at the CMT Music Awards on June 4, 2014.\nThe song received generally favorable response from the critics.  Matt Bjorke of Roughstock thought the song playful, fun, and \"sure to be a fast-selling hit.\" Jason Scott of AXS called it \"a fun, beat-driven summer anthem\" and rated it four stars out of five. Taste of Country said that the song's \"ready-for-anything lyrics and the way that Lambert and Underwood belt them out with such power, make \u2018Somethin\u2019 Bad\u2019 a catchy girl-power anthem.\"\n\"Somethin' Bad\" debuted at No. 39 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart following its release for sales on May 19, 2014 (chart dated June 7, 2014).

The video is presented as a trailer for a film where the pair play poker, ride Indian motorcycles and engage in a jewel heist in which they flee in a luxury Bell Helicopter.\nMiranda purchased the two Indian Motorcycles keeping one for herself, while giving the other to Carrie as a \"thank you\" for doing the song with her. Carrie tweeted a pic of her on the bike.

It was written by Alex da Kid, Ben McKee, Dan Reynolds, Daniel Wayne Sermon, Josh Mosser and produced by Alex da Kid. The song appears on their major-label debut extended play, Continued Silence, and also makes an appearance on their debut studio album, Night Visions, as the fourth track. \"Demons\" was solicited to American triple-A radio stations on January 28, 2013 and to modern rock stations on April 1 and serves as the album's overall fifth single and was released as the third single from Night Visions in the United States, and was later released to contemporary hit radio stations on 17 September 2013 as an official single. The lyrics portray the protagonist warning the significant other of his or her flaws.\nThe song was a commercial success, becoming their second top ten single after \"Radioactive\".  It spent twelve weeks in the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100, four of which were spent at its number six peak. It is Imagine Dragons' second song to stay more than one year on the Hot 100 (61 weeks).  Within two years of its release, more than 4.1 million copies were sold in the United States, making it the eighth most downloaded song in rock history. It has also been a moderate commercial success worldwide, charting in several countries.  The song won a MuchMusic Video Award for International Video of the Year \u2013 Group (2014) and an iHeartRadio Music Award for Alternative Rock Song of the Year (2014).\nThe song is written in E-flat major with a slow-moderate tempo.\nAn MTV report on the \"Demons\" music video stated that it would \"fit nicely with the artful imagery of 'It's Time' and the thoroughly out-there puppet grappling of 'Radioactive'.\" Released on May 7, 2013 and shot in Las Vegas, Nevada at the band's performance at The Joint on February 9, 2013, the video features a mix of live footage of the band and a companion narrative. Various characters with personal hardships are depicted, including a grieving daughter, a man with Marfan syndrome who stares at himself in a mirror, a victim of parental abuse and a military veteran. The meaning imposed is that most don't see beyond the face that everyone puts on for the public. The clip ends with a dedication to Tyler Robinson (1995\u20132013), a fan of the band who died at the age of 17 in March 2013 following a battle with cancer.\nLatvian-born American singer Masha covered \"Demons\" on her YouTube channel. Ryan Seacrest's official website described her cover as \"a soulful ballad by replacing the studio version's heavy rock beats with the soft, resonating sound of a piano \u2014 showcasing her powerful vocals and truly capturing the powerful meaning behind the cryptic lyrics.\"\nIn March 2016, Chris Daughtry and Jencarlos Canela recorded and performed a cover of the song during the Fox television special The Passion and its album. It was sung in the story where Judas Iscariot (Daughtry) betrays Jesus (Jencarlos) and gives his reasons, and Jesus seems to be sympathetic to Judas; the lyrics are modified to alternate between first-person and second-person as they sang.\nIn December 2018 Muslim Nasheed artists Khaled Siddiq and Siedd released a cover version of 'Demons' on YouTube. The lyrics are largely the same, but there are a few changes towards the end.\nIn May 2021, 2CELLOS released a \u201chaunting\u201d cover of the song, gaining over 400 thousand views in the first week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDan Reynolds \u2013 lead vocals\nDaniel Wayne Sermon \u2013 guitars, backing vocals\nBen McKee \u2013 bass, keyboards, backing vocals\nDaniel Platzman \u2013 drums, backing vocals\nJ Brownz \u2013 additional guitar, additional bass\nOlivier, Bobby (June 22, 2017). \"Imagine Dragons Have Figured Out the Future of Popular Rock\".

Bernardo and their producers Mattman & Robin. It was released by Kidinakorner and Interscope Records on July 17, 2018, serving as the lead single from the band's fourth studio album, Origins (2018), as well as the seasonal anthem of the 2018 ESPN College Football. It became their fifth number one song on the US Hot Rock Songs chart.\nLead singer Dan Reynolds noted that \"Natural\" is about \"finding yourself and being willing and able to stand up to whatever adversity comes your way\". He said in a press release announcing the song: \"Living in a dog-eat-dog world can bring out the worst in you, and sometimes, the best. It would be a lie to tell you I haven't become somewhat skeptical about some things in the last decade of my life. However, I believe that when you truly learn to love yourself, the judging eyes and hateful words become meaningless.\"\nThe song was chosen by ESPN as the anthem of the 2018 College Football season. It is the second time that an Imagine Dragons song was chosen, the first being \"Roots\" in 2015. \"'Natural' embodies the energy, spirit and drama of each team's journey to the College Football Playoff, and that is why it was chosen as this year's anthem,\" said Emeka Ofodile, ESPN vice president of sports marketing. It is also part of the soundtrack for EA Sports' NHL 19.\n\"Natural\" is a pop rock song which features a \"mix of explosive drums and inspiring lyrics\", with \"stadium-rocking instrumentation\" over the chorus.\nMarkos Papadatos of Digital Journal regarded \"Natural\" as a \"well-crafted and well-produced song\", writing that \"Reynolds' voice is impressive, raw and powerful\", and that the song \"garners two thumbs up\". Sam Tornow of Billboard described the song as \"ferocious\" and \"smash-mouth\". Mike Wass of Idolator named the song a \"radio-ready anthem\", expecting it to be \"another smash\" following the success of the band's third studio album Evolve (2017). Tiana Timmerberg of Radio.com called the song \"energetic and inspiring\", deeming it \"a feel-good jam with positive and empowering lyrics\".\nA music video for the song was released on August 24, 2018. It depicts frontman Dan Reynolds as the apparent owner of a spooky house including shots of a woman in a bathtub, the same woman being pursued by other inhabitants of the house and an abnormally tall man resembling Slenderman, a supposed funeral for the woman, Wayne Sermon, Ben McKee and Daniel Platzman fading into dust, Reynolds digging a grave and burying the woman alive, and other shots no the house and its inhabitants, along with a clip of a lion mauling a zebra.\nIts music video has received over 410 million views and 4 million likes as of March 2021.\nOn July 19, 2018, Imagine Dragons made a live television debut of the single on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The performance featured a guitar solo by lead guitarist Wayne Sermon that expanded on the studio recording.\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nMattman & Robin \u2013 production, engineering\nSerban Ghenea \u2013 mixing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaherty, Kevin (July 17, 2018). \"ESPN picks pump-up song for the 2018 college football season\". 247Sports.

Released on the 1994 album Resurrection, \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\" has since become one of Common's best known songs.  Produced by No I.D., its jazzy beat samples \"The Changing World\" by George Benson. A video directed by Chris Halliburton was made for this song. The song is also found on Common's greatest hits album, Thisisme Then.\n\nThe song uses an extended acronym, using a woman to represent hip hop music. The acronym \"H.E.R\" means \"Hip-Hop in its Essence is Real\"\"\nThe song speaks on the direction that hip hop music took during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It specifically refers to the fall of conscious and Afrocentric rap; as well as the rising popularity of West Coast hip hop and G-funk. In the song, Common makes an analogy comparing the degradation of a woman with the deterioration of hip hop music after its commercial success forced it into the mainstream. This criticism ignited a feud with West Coast rapper Ice Cube, and helped fuel the growing animosity towards the West Coast hip hop scene during the early stages of the East Coast-West Coast rivalry despite Common hailing from the Midwest.\nIt is often regarded as one of the greatest hip hop recordings ever. Tiffany Hamilton of AllHipHop.com describes it as a \"timeless ode to Hip-Hop [...] that established Common as one of the pioneers in conscious Hip-Hop.\" Vukile Simelane of RapReviews.com claims it to have one of the \"fattest beat[s] ever constructed\". Alex Henderson of Allmusic considers it to be the standout track on Resurrection. Duke University professor Mark Anthony Neal considers it to be Common's best single ever. Andrea Duncan-Mao of XXL considers it to be a \"bittersweet ode to hip-hop\" and a \"classic\" track. Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal considers it to be a \"classic hip-hop parable\". In 2008, it was ranked number 69 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. It was ranked #1 on About.com's Greatest Rap Songs Of All Time.\nIn 1999, \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\" was featured on the Chuck D hosted compilation album Louder Than a Bomb.\nIn 2002, the opening lines were sung by Taye Diggs and Sanaa Lathan in a park scene for the movie Brown Sugar.\nIn 2005, Jin released a single named \"Top 5 (Dead or Alive)\", where he mentions Common and the song\u00a0:\"Trying to figure out the fly chick I discovered... At the same time Common said he used to love her\".\nIn 2007, The Teriyaki Boyz released a song titled \"I Still Love H.E.R.\" featuring Kanye West\nIn 2008, on the underground track \"Who Killed Hip Hop\" Joe Budden references the track stating \"But I still love H.E.R. the way Common used to\"\nThe Game references the song in \"Angel (ft. Common),\" saying, \"So I start Hip-Hop and I understand why Common used to love H.E.R.\"\nIn 2009, Brooklyn emcee Israel The ILLa Real stated his debut album's title I Fell In Love With H.E.R. (Hearing Every Rhyme) was inspired by \"I Used To Love H.E.R.\"\nThe opening lines of \"I Used To Love H.E.R.\" are also used as a reference in the opening lines to Kanye West's song \"Homecoming\".\nIn the Clipse song \"Showing Out\", a reference is made saying \"Common loved H.E.R., I wish I'd never met her.\"\nIn 2011, New Jersey singer Eric Roberson used the opening lines of \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\" on his song \"Strangers\" from his 2011 album Mister Nice Guy.\nIn 2012, East Coast rap group Pro Era made a song \"I Still Love H.E.R.\" inspired by \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\"\nIn 2014 Christian hip-hop and spoken word artist Propaganda rapped the opening lines of \"I Used To Love H.E.R.\" on his song \"I Ain't Gave Up on You Yet\".\nIn 2019, Common released an album titled Let Love, which included the song \"HER Love\", in reference to his 1994 classic.\n9th Wonder, a producer from North Carolina, remixed \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\" and released the remix as a single. Independent record label Boom Bap Records distributed the single, which contained \"The 6th Sense\" as a b-side.\nJazz band Vitamin Jazz covered \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\" on their 2006 album Commonication: The Smooth Jazz Sessions to the Music of Common.\nJapanese hip hop group Teriyaki Boyz and American rapper Kanye West made a song called \"I Still Love H.E.R.\" which alludes to \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\".\nKorean hip hop rapper The Quiett has a song called Give It to H.E.R. in his 3rd album, which also is related to \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\" and uses similar metaphor.\nKanye West raps a first verse that pays homage to the song in his song"

It was released by Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records as the second single from the album on April 6, 2018, along with its music video. The song was produced by Murda Beatz, Noah \"40\" Shebib and Corey Litwin with co-production handled by Blaqnmild. It features additional vocals by Big Freedia and 5th Ward Weebie. It contains a sample from \"Ex-Factor\", written and performed by Lauryn Hill, which itself samples \"Can It Be All So Simple\", written and performed by Wu-Tang Clan. The latter song also samples \"The Way We Were\". Therefore, Hill, the eight members of Wu-Tang Clan, and Marvin Hamlisch, Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman are credited among the composers.\nIt debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, replacing Drake's own \"God's Plan\" and becoming his fifth US number one. It also topped the UK Singles Chart and ARIA Singles Chart, becoming his second number-one song of 2018 in the two countries after \"God's Plan\". Rolling Stone ranked it 54th on their list of the '100 Best  Songs of the 2010s'. In 2021, The Guardian ranked it number-one on their list of 'Drake's 30 Greatest songs'. The song was awarded two ASCAP Awards, including Top Rap Song, and was nominated for Best Rap Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\nOn March 14, 2018, Lauryn Hill's son Joshua Omaru Marley posted a snippet of the song on Snapchat. Drake later confirmed an upcoming Murda Beatz-produced single during an Instagram Live session. On April 5, Drake made a surprise appearance during a Majid Jordan concert in Toronto. \"The reason I'm here tonight is because I'm back in the city finishing my album,\" he told the audience. \"I've got a new single dropping tomorrow night, too, just in case you got some free time.\"\n\"Nice for What\" is an upbeat bounce song which contains elements of early 2000s R&B, with a length of three minutes thirty seconds. It samples Lauryn Hill's song \"Ex-Factor\" (1998), \"Drag Rap\" by the Showboys (1986), \"Get Your Roll On\" by Big Tymers (2000), and also features clips from performances by Big Freedia. Lyrically, the hook of Drake's song samples Lauryn Hill singing about \"cutting loose in the midst of a relationship\".\nDirected by Karena Evans, the accompanying music video shows women carrying out various activities, including swimming, dancing, modeling, playing with children, horse-riding, and holding a business meeting. It features guest appearances from, in order of appearance, Olivia Wilde, Misty Copeland, Issa Rae, Rashida Jones, Jourdan Dunn, Tracee Ellis Ross, Tiffany Haddish, Yara Shahidi, Zoe Saldana, Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhj\u00e4rta, Letitia Wright, Bria Vinaite, Emma Roberts, Syd, Michelle Rodriguez and Drake himself. Evans called it an honour to work on the video, writing on Instagram that it was \"a privilege and a blessing to have told this story with every single one of you revolutionary women, both in front and behind the camera\".\n\"Nice for What\" received positive reviews from music critics, with many praising its promotion of female empowerment. Hugh McIntyre of Forbes regarded the \"perfectly-pitched\" song as \"another perfect delivery from the biggest artist in hip-hop\", writing that the \"vocal sample helps the track stand out from much of the rest of his discography\". Kevin Lozano of Pitchfork awarded the song \"Best New Track\", praising Drake for \"smoothly handling the impeccable production from Murda Beatz\", and lauding the song as \"a fantastic piece of hip-hop machinery\" and \"one of Drake's most complete releases in some time\".\nChris DeVille of Stereogum deemed the song \"a big, brash, almost obnoxiously loud New Orleans bounce-inspired production\", describing it as \"extremely poppy and sounds like a bid for continued commercial dominance\".\nBillboard named \"Nice for What\" the fifth-best song of 2018. Rolling Stone also named \"Nice for What\" the fifth-best song of 2018, and ranked it 54th on their list of the '100 Best  Songs of the 2010s'.\nIn the United States, Drake became the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace his former number-one debut (\"God's Plan\") at the top of the Hot 100. It debuted with 88,000 downloads sold and 60.4 million streams. \"Nice for What\" became the 30th song in Billboard history"

It was released for digital download on February 10, 2012. \"Turn Up the Music\" is an uptempo song which draws from the genres of electronic dance and house. Instrumentation consists of pulsating beats,  synthesizers, a \"throbbing bass\" and percussion. According to Mason Jr., the song's inspiration came from visualizing Brown as an artist, \"how he dances and how he performs, and giving him something to match that energy.\"\n\"Turn Up the Music\" garnered positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its production and compared the song to Brown's previous singles \"Forever\" (2008) and \"Yeah 3x\" (2010), for its similar musical direction. Critics also noted its similarities to the work of LMFAO and David Guetta. \"Turn Up the Music\" achieved commercial success worldwide, becoming Brown's first number one single on the UK Singles Chart, and his eleventh top ten single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song also reached the top ten in Australia and New Zealand, and the top twenty in Canada, Hungary, Ireland and Slovakia. It was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).\nThe accompanying music video for \"Turn Up the Music\" was directed by Godfrey Taberez and Brown, and filmed in Los Angeles, California. It features Brown at a party filled with masked people, where he performs heavily choreographed dance routines. The video garnered positive reception from critics, for its series of dance sequences which were compared to Michael Jackson. It won Best Male Video and Best Choreography at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, and earned Taberez and Brown a nomination for Video Director of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards. Brown promoted the song with live performances on televised shows and at awards ceremonies, including Dancing with the Stars, Today, the 2012 NBA All-Star Game halftime show, the 54th Grammy Awards, the 2012 Billboard Music Awards and the BET Awards. He also included the song in his set list at Supafest Australia. The official remix of \"Turn Up the Music\" premiered online on February 20, 2012, and features Brown's former girlfriend Rihanna.\n\"Turn Up the Music\" was written by Alexander \"Fuego\" Palmer, Chris Brown, Damon Thomas, Harvey Mason Jr., Michael \"Mike J\" Jimenez, Terence Cole and Agent X. Production for the song was handled by Fuego and The Underdogs. The mixing engineering process was completed by John Hanes with assistance by Phil Seaford, while the audio mixing was completed by Serban Ghenea. \"Turn Up the Music\" was recorded at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California and Mason Sound in North Hollywood, California by Andrew Hey and Brian Springer with assistance by Iain Findley. In an interview with MTV News, Mason Jr. revealed that inspiration for the song came from visualizing Brown as an artist. He explained, \"The inspiration was really him as an artist, visualizing how he dances and how he performs, and giving him something to match that energy.\"\nOn January 25, 2012, Brown announced via his official Twitter account that the lead single from his fifth studio album Fortune would be called \"Turn Up the Music\", tweeting \"New FORTUNE single coming 1/26!!!

Keys co-wrote and co-produced the R&B ballad with Jeff Bhasker and Salaam Remi. The song contains an interpolation of the drums from the 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" by American rock guitarist Billy Squier, who received a writing credit on \"Girl on Fire\". Released on September 4, 2012, as the lead single from the album of the same name, \"Girl on Fire\" is Keys' first release under RCA Records following the closure of J Records, after a reorganization at Sony Music Entertainment.\n\"Girl on Fire\" was inspired by Keys' giving birth to her son Egypt and marriage to husband Swizz Beatz. Keys recorded a three-track suite for the song, consisting of the main version in addition to two remixes. The first remix, titled \"Inferno\", adds two new verses from American hip hop artist Nicki Minaj, whilst the second mix titled \"Bluelight\" strips back the drums and piano leaving a sparse bass-led production and re-recorded \"smokey\" vocals. \"Girl on Fire\" opened to extremely positive reviews from critics, with many praising Keys' vocals and the song's production. Keys performed \"Girl on Fire\" for the first time at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards on September 6, 2012, where she was joined by Minaj and American gymnastics gold-medalist Gabby Douglas. The song has been certified 5x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\"Girl on Fire\" is the lead single and title track from Alicia Keys' fifth studio album, Girl on Fire (2012). Alongside the main single, Keys recorded two other versions: the Inferno Remix which features new verses from Nicki Minaj and a Bluelight Remix which strips back the vocals and production from the main single. Gerrick Kennedy from the LA Times spoke of the multiple versions of the song commenting that the main single was most likely made for pop radio, but noted that Minaj's verses on the Inferno Remix would probably get noticed more. On being able to premiere her new song at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, Keys said, \nDebuting a new song at the VMAs is definitely special. I debuted 'No One' at the VMAs\u00a0\u2014 it was the first time anyone in the world heard 'No One,' Keys said. \"It's the perfect setting. It's the right energy. It's the right vibe. People are so excited about the night of music and hearing different styles that it just goes over really well. I can't wait!\n\n\"Girl on Fire\" is a midtempo song written by Keys, Jeff Bhasker, Salaam Remi and American rock guitarist Billy Squier. Squier earns a writing credit for the inclusion of an interpolation of the drums from his 1980 song \"The Big Beat\". Composed on the key of A major, \"Girl on Fire\" uses common time and is set to a \"heavy beat\" at a tempo of 93 beats per minute. Keys' vocals range in the song over an octave from a low note of C\u266f\u2084 up to a high note of E\u2085. On the main single, Keys opens the songs with the lyrics \"She got both feet on the ground and she's burning it down. She got her head in the clouds and she's not backing down. This girl is on fire!\" Keys' lyrics centre around toasting the \"achievements of women everywhere\", particularly with the hook \"She's just a girl and she's on fire\", which according to MTV's Rob Markman is delivered with a \"calming-yet-commanding wail\". Markman also spoke of the pace of the song, describing it as \"pulsating\". LA Time's Gerrick Kennedy expanded further describing the songs components as \"a fierce battlecry over a fast-building simplistic hook\". Critics likened \"Girl on Fire\" to Keys' previous singles \"No One\" (2007) and \"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\" (2009). Throwing \"If I Ain't Got You\" (2004) into the list of comparisons, Erin Thompson from Seattle Weekly said \"Girl on Fire\" compares to previous Keys' ballads with its \"quiet, unassuming verses leading into big, empathic choruses.\"\nThe Inferno version features Nicki Minaj, who wrote and rapped two new verses on the song. Minaj's vocals were recorded at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. The inferno remix uses the same production and sample as the main single however, the first two verses of the song were described as \"understated\" by Carl Williot from Idolator, with Minaj leading the remix with a new rap verse. She raps \"Took me on the balcony, telling me to jump with her/ Yeah I'm in the ghost but I ain't doing stunts with her/ I ain't trying to be that, haters want to see"

The single was originally set to be released on 25 November 2015, but was postponed to 3 December. The song was highly successful, peaking in the top 10 in most of the countries. It charted in, and reached the top spot in more than 10 countries. As of July 2021, it is the 20th most viewed video on YouTube and also 13th most viewed music video, with over 3 billion views, making it the first EDM track to hit that milestone. \"Faded\" is also the 45th most streamed song on Spotify as of July\u00a02021, with over 1.4 billion streams.\nWalker debuted a live performance of \"Faded\" with Solheim and string support on 27 February 2016 at the X Games in Oslo. The performance was aired live on Norwegian television.\nThe song \"Faded\" is a revamped version of Walker's past composition \"Fade\", which was released via the record label NoCopyrightSounds in 2014.\nIn the creation of \"Faded\", Walker was inspired by the music producer Ahrix's sound on his track \"Nova\" from 2013. In an interview he stated: \"The melodies and the way the track progresses are what's so unique and its what inspired me to create 'Fade' which later on became 'Faded'\". The style is inspired by the Norwegian producer K-391. The melody, I don't know where it came from, but I try to let my emotions and feelings have a big influence on the melodies I produce.\"\nWhile the structure and melody are almost identical to \"Fade\", \"Faded\" is noticeably different for its piano intro and outro; with uncredited vocals by Iselin Solheim and mainstream production.\nThe song is set in common time and has a tempo of 90 beats per minute. It is written in the key of E\u266d minor with a chord progression of E\u266dm\u2013C\u266d-G\u266d\u2013D\u266d.\n\"Faded\" became a worldwide commercial success upon its release, topping Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish singles charts, as well as entering the top 3 in the Danish singles chart.\nThe song peaked at number one in more than ten countries and in the top 5 in more than 25 countries.\nIt also charted in various countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It also reached number one on the Shazam Worldwide Top 100 Popular Songs in February 2016, and by March 2016, had become the world's most Shazamed song.\nIts music video on YouTube reached 1 billion views on 26 March 2017, and has received over 3 billion views to date, making it the 21st most viewed YouTube video. It is also the 6th most liked YouTube video with over 23 million likes.\nSeveral female vocalists have performed the song live: Iselin Solheim, the original vocalist on the recording, Ingrid Helene H\u00e5vik (vocalist of Highasakite), Tove Styrke, Alexandra Rotan, Angelina Jordan, Zara Larsson and Torine Michelle.\nOn 4 November 2017 Alan Walker performed the song live with Against the Current at the 2017 League of Legends World Championship closing ceremony in Beijing.\nA music video was released, featuring Shahab Salehi as the protagonist. It was produced and edited by Bror Bror and directed by Rikkard and Tobias H\u00e4ggbom; Rikkard H\u00e4ggbom served as director of photography. \nOn September 24, 2021, a new music video called Paradise was released on YouTube with collaboration with K-391 and Boy in Space. That music video takes place at the same time as Faded, with it becoming part of the World of Walker (WoW) Universe, as it uncovers a deeper plot within the previous music video Faded, serving as the follow-up, and spin-off of both the WoW, and Faded.\nThe video shows a young man dressed in scruffy clothes and covering his face, roaming with his backpack and a photograph of his home in his hand. He wanders through  devastated high rises and derelict structures in an abandoned town, wielding a flare to explore a dark building. Guided by the photo, he finally locates his home, which lies in ruins. With a final look at his home, he removes his mask, and the video fades to black.\nThe video was filmed in Estonia at such locations as the Linnahall building; a disused textile manufacturing plant and a concert hall in Tallinn; the former Rummu prison; the Rummu quarry and lake alongside the adjoining spoil tip in Vasalemma Parish; and the city of Paldiski. The last shot features the ruins of a building near the shore on Pakri Peninsula just outside Paldiski, on the outskirts of"

Amber \"Sevyn\" Streeter sang background vocals. \"Don't Judge Me\" was leaked on the Internet on June 26, 2012, three days before the official release date of Fortune. The artwork for the song debuted online on July 28, 2012; it features Brown, wearing a \"white dress shirt and skinny black tie\", striking a pose in front of a blue backdrop. \"Don't Judge Me\" was sent to urban contemporary radio stations in the United States on August 14, 2012, as the fifth single from the album. On November 2, 2012, the song was released as an extended play in Australia, Canada, France, and New Zealand, featuring the album version and three remixes. The single version of \"Don't Judge Me\" was released on iTunes Stores in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, and Sweden on November 23, 2012. A remix extended play, featuring the album version, music video and three remixes, was released in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland on November 23, 2012. In the United States, a remix extended play, featuring the single version and five remixes, was released on November 27, 2012.\n\"Don't Judge Me\" is a midtempo ballad that runs for three minutes and fifteen seconds, with instrumentation provided by drums. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush noted that \"Don't Judge Me\" features \"a slow, sensuous romp\", which she found reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Lyrically, Brown asks his lover to forgive him \"for his past indiscretions\" and \"move on with the future.\" In the song, Brown encourages his lover that there is nothing going on between him and his ex-girlfriend as he sings, \"You're hearing rumors about me / And you can't stomach the thought / Of someone touching my body / When you're so close to my heart / I won't deny what they saying / Because most of it is true / But it was all before I fell for you.\" He later declares \"that he is a changed man who can now be trusted\" as shown in the lines, \"Take me as I am / Not who I was / I'll promise I'll be / The one that you can trust.\" During the chorus, Brown sings \"So please don't judge me / and I won't judge you / because it could get ugly / before it gets beautiful.\" Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press noted that Brown \"sings in his signature semi-high pitch\", and critics speculated that the lyrics were about Brown's former relationships with aspiring American model and fashion designer Karrueche Tran and Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. Holly Frith of Entertainment Wise noted that Rihanna \"may be the inspiration\" for the lyrics. Rolling Stone's Maura Johnston described \"Don't Judge Me\" as \"a tender love song,\" while Andrew Hampp of Billboard magazine referred to it as a \"take me as I am\" type of ballad. Hazel Robinson of California Literary Review noted that \"Don't Judge Me\" is similar to Brown's 2009 song, \"Changed Man.\"\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Don't Judge Me\" was directed by Colin Tilley and Brown, and was filmed in August 2012. On August 29, 2012 Brown released an image from the shoot, showing himself"

It was released as the first promotional single from the record, on September 21, 2010 by Elektra Records. \"Liquor Store Blues\" is a reggae track with dub influences written by Mars, Phillip Lawrence, Ari Levine, Dwayne Chin-Quee, Mitchum Chin, Marley and Thomas Pentz. It was produced by the former three, under their alias, the Smeezingtons and Chin-Quee. Lyrically, the song addresses a way of avoiding problems by drinking with hope that afterwards everything will be fine.\n\"Liquor Store Blues\" received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Marley's appearance but called it a copy of Sublime's style. The song peaked at number 97 on the Canadian Hot 100, number 20 on the Latin Pop Songs and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The music video, directed by Jake Summer, features Mars and Marley singing together with a colorful background and \"acid-trip\" visual effects. It was nominated for International Video of the Year at the Danish GAFFA Awards. Mars performed \"Liquor Store Blues\" on The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour (2010\u20132012) and the Hooligans in Wondaland Tour (2011).\nIn an interview with Sound on Sound, Ari Levine said that the team, the Smeezingtons, never met Supa Dups personally and that \"Liquor Store Blues\" was finished by exchanging files of the song. The latter producer helped finishing the track by providing a dub sound, something the three of them \"could just not nail it\". During an interview granted to Vibe, Bruno Mars said that he never met Damian Marley, since the latter did \"his part\" after a show in Washington. Nevertheless, the singer explained how Marley was guested in the song:\nI just wrote the song called \"Liquor Store Blues\". It had this reggae vibe...when I wrote, I was like, \"Man, what if we could just get Damian on this?\" So we [the Smeezingtons] made the phone call, and he came in with open arms and destroyed it.\nOn September 21, 2010, the song was released as the first promotional single as an iTunes Store-exclusive prior to Doo-Wops & Hooligans album release in October 2010, under Elektra Records. In the countries outside the United States, such as Germany, it was released under Warner Entertainment Group.\n\"Liquor Store Blues\" is a reggae song with a \"melodious boom-box midtempo\". It is heavily influenced by dub music and borrowes \"heavily from roots reggae\". It has been compared to Travie McCoy and Mars's previous song \"Billionaire\" and the music of Sublime, Michael Jackson and Bedouin Soundclash. According to the digital sheet music the song was composed in common time and in the key of C# minor with a tempo of 144 beats per minute. Mars's and Marley's vocals range spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of C6.\nThe song's lyrics describe feelings of \"pain\" and \"sorrow\", using alcohol as a method to flee \"bad fortune in an odd foreshadowing of events\". In the end, hope is found by \"getting messed up today\" since on the following day everything will be fine. Tyrone S. Reid from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that the record explores addiction \"wonderfully, if humorously\" through the lyrics \"I take one shot for my pain, one drag for my sorrow/Get messed up today, I\u2019ll be okay tomorrow\". Entertainment Weekly's, Brad Wete stated that Mars is about to \"drown his sorrows in a tall glass of alcohol\". Rap-Up magazine commented that the recording's lyrics regard \"a quick escape from his bad fortune in an odd foreshadowing of events\".\n\"Liquor Store Blues\" was written by Mars, Philip Lawrence, Levine, Dwayne \"Supa Dups\" Chin-Quee, Mitchum Chin, Marley and Thomas Pentz and produced by the former three, under their alias, the Smeezingtons, and Chin-Quee. The latter was in charge of programming and arranging the drums, which he played. Chin played the guitar, bass, and keys. Levine engineered the song at Levcon Studios in California. The mixing of the track was done at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles by Manny Marroquin, with Christian Plata and Erik Madrid serving as assistants. It was mastered by Stephen Marcussen at Marcussen Mastering in"

It was released for digital download on February 10, 2012. \"Turn Up the Music\" is an uptempo song which draws from the genres of electronic dance and house. Instrumentation consists of pulsating beats,  synthesizers, a \"throbbing bass\" and percussion. According to Mason Jr., the song's inspiration came from visualizing Brown as an artist, \"how he dances and how he performs, and giving him something to match that energy.\"\n\"Turn Up the Music\" garnered positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its production and compared the song to Brown's previous singles \"Forever\" (2008) and \"Yeah 3x\" (2010), for its similar musical direction. Critics also noted its similarities to the work of LMFAO and David Guetta. \"Turn Up the Music\" achieved commercial success worldwide, becoming Brown's first number one single on the UK Singles Chart, and his eleventh top ten single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song also reached the top ten in Australia and New Zealand, and the top twenty in Canada, Hungary, Ireland and Slovakia. It was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).\nThe accompanying music video for \"Turn Up the Music\" was directed by Godfrey Taberez and Brown, and filmed in Los Angeles, California. It features Brown at a party filled with masked people, where he performs heavily choreographed dance routines. The video garnered positive reception from critics, for its series of dance sequences which were compared to Michael Jackson. It won Best Male Video and Best Choreography at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, and earned Taberez and Brown a nomination for Video Director of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards. Brown promoted the song with live performances on televised shows and at awards ceremonies, including Dancing with the Stars, Today, the 2012 NBA All-Star Game halftime show, the 54th Grammy Awards, the 2012 Billboard Music Awards and the BET Awards. He also included the song in his set list at Supafest Australia. The official remix of \"Turn Up the Music\" premiered online on February 20, 2012, and features Brown's former girlfriend Rihanna.\n\"Turn Up the Music\" was written by Alexander \"Fuego\" Palmer, Chris Brown, Damon Thomas, Harvey Mason Jr., Michael \"Mike J\" Jimenez, Terence Cole and Agent X. Production for the song was handled by Fuego and The Underdogs. The mixing engineering process was completed by John Hanes with assistance by Phil Seaford, while the audio mixing was completed by Serban Ghenea. \"Turn Up the Music\" was recorded at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California and Mason Sound in North Hollywood, California by Andrew Hey and Brian Springer with assistance by Iain Findley. In an interview with MTV News, Mason Jr. revealed that inspiration for the song came from visualizing Brown as an artist. He explained, \"The inspiration was really him as an artist, visualizing how he dances and how he performs, and giving him something to match that energy.\"\nOn January 25, 2012, Brown announced via his official Twitter account that the lead single from his fifth studio album Fortune would be called \"Turn Up the Music\", tweeting \"New FORTUNE single coming 1/26!!! TURN UP THE MUSIC!!!!\". The following day, both the single and its artwork were posted online, showing Brown wearing an unbuttoned shirt and a fedora, while words in different languages are displayed. \"Turn Up the Music\" was officially sent to contemporary hit radio playlists in the United States on February 7, 2012.

It was released in April 1989 as the lead single from his first solo album, Full Moon Fever. The song was co-written by Petty and Jeff Lynne, also his writing partner for the album. It reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Album Rock Tracks chart for five weeks, starting the album's road to multi-platinum status.\nPetty recalled the recording of this song to Mojo magazine: \"At the session George Harrison sang and played the guitar. I had a terrible cold that day, and George went to the store and bought a ginger root, boiled it and had me stick my head in the pot to get the ginger steam to open up my sinuses, and then I ran in and did the take.\"\nA message of defiance against unnamed forces of difficulty and possibly oppression, the lyric is set against a mid-tempo beat:\nWell I know what's right, I got just one life\n\nin a world that keeps on pushin' me around\n\nbut I'll stand my ground, and I won't back down\nDue to its themes, the song was played often on American radio following the September 11 attacks.  Petty and the Heartbreakers played a quiet but resolute version of the song at the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon following the 2001 attacks.\nIn the 2007 documentary Runnin' Down a Dream, Petty said that he felt some initial hesitation about releasing the song, given its clear and unabashed message.\nIn January 2015, it was revealed that an agreement had been reached whereby Petty and Jeff Lynne would be credited as co-writers of Sam Smith's song \"Stay with Me\" and receive 12.5% of its royalties. Petty's publishing company had contacted Smith's publisher after noticing a likeness between \"Stay with Me\" and \"I Won't Back Down\". Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith plagiarized him, saying \"All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times you catch it before it gets out the studio door but in this case it got by. Sam's people were very understanding of our predicament and we easily came to an agreement\". Smith claimed not to have heard \"I Won't Back Down\" before writing \"Stay with Me\", but acknowledged the similarity after listening to the song, calling it \"a complete coincidence\". Petty and Lynne were not eligible for a Grammy Award (\"Stay with Me\" was nominated for three awards at the 57th annual ceremony, winning two of them) as the Recording Academy considered \"Stay with Me\" to have been interpolated from \"I Won't Back Down\" by Smith, James Napier, and William Phillips, the writers of \"Stay with Me\"; Petty and Lynne were instead given certificates to honor their participation in the work, as is usual for writers of sampled or interpolated work.\nTom Petty \u2013 lead vocals and backing vocals, acoustic guitar\nMike Campbell \u2013 slide guitar\nGeorge Harrison \u2013 acoustic guitar, backing vocals\nJeff Lynne \u2013 bass, backing vocals\nHowie Epstein \u2013 backing vocals\nPhil Jones \u2013 Linn LM-1, drums\nRingo Starr \u2013 Linn LM-1, drums in video\n\n\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush used \"I Won't Back Down\" at campaign events during the 2000 presidential campaign but was compelled to stop using the song after receiving a cease and desist letter from Petty's publisher. Petty then went on to perform the song at Al Gore's home after Gore conceded the election to President Bush. Jim Webb used the song for his successful bid for one of Virginia's U.S. Senate seats in 2006, as did Hillary Clinton during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign.  The song was also used at campaign events for Congressman Ron Paul of Texas during the 2008 Republican presidential primary campaign, as well as for events for his Campaign for Liberty. The song was also played at an event for Republican Connecticut gubernatorial nominee, Tom Foley. The song was also played at the 2012 Democratic National Convention after a speech delivered by President Bill Clinton, in which President Barack Obama came out on stage to salute him.\nIn June 2020, Petty's family issued a cease and desist letter to President Donald Trump's campaign for its use of \"I Won't Back Down\" at Trump's rally in Tulsa on June 20, 2020. The letter stated: \"Trump was in no way authorized to use this song to further a campaign that leaves too many Americans and common sense behind. Both the late Tom Petty and his family firmly stand against racism and discrimination of any kind. Tom Petty would never want a song of his used for a campaign of hate. He liked to bring people"

It was released as the first single from their second international studio album Backstreet's Back in June 1997, and the third single from their self-titled debut US studio album in March 1998. The music video was directed by American director Joseph Kahn.\nZomba chairman Clive Calder suggested that \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" should be released as a single, which was met with resistance from Jive Records president Barry Weiss, as he believed that it would be weird to have a song called \"Backstreet's Back\" on the Backstreet Boys' first US album. The band suggested it could just mean that they were back home. After Canadian markets began playing the song, US markets near the border began picking the song up. They met with Weiss and asked that the song be added to the US album after the first million units had already been produced.\nThere are two versions of the song. The international album features the album or 7\" version, which is the standard recording. The US album features the extended version of the song which includes an extended breakdown section, but cuts the bridge. The music video for the song was cut to both versions of the song, with the extended video released to the US market, and the standard video released everywhere else.\nLarry Flick from Billboard commented that \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" contained a \"contagious dance/pop beat and catchy hook that perfectly showcases this talented group's voices\".\nWritten and produced by Max Martin and Denniz Pop, \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" is one of the Backstreet Boys' most successful singles to date, reaching number 4 in the US Billboard Hot 100, running 22 weeks, and number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. It is certified platinum in the United States with 2.1 million sales.\n\nThe music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, and filmed in Los Angeles, California from June 16\u201318, 1997. Kahn was contacted by Jive to direct a project with a \"white Jodeci\". Initially unaware who the Backstreet Boys were, he was shocked by the group's European sales figures after being given a cassette tape and publicity release about them. Initially a grunge and hip-hop director, he wanted to explore the pop genre, since he grew up listening to music from the 1980s.\nThe haunted house aesthetic was based on a treatment Kahn envisioned for rapper Ice Cube a few months prior, and was inspired by the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\". Kahn and the group wanted Antonio Fargas to portray the bus driver, as they were fans of Starsky & Hutch. The video shoot lasted for 36 hours, with Nick Carter's mummy shot being filmed last. Jive did not get behind the concept of the band in costumes or the $1 million requirements, and did not believe MTV would respect the video. The band ultimately had to put up their own money to shoot the video and had to fight with the label to get reimbursed once it was successful. The video premiered outside the United States in July 1997, although viewers with MuchMusic USA were able to see it as at the time it was still mostly a simulcast of the Canadian channel. In a 2017 interview with Billboard, Kahn stated that the video's impact broadened his view of pop culture, while creating a new scene in the US.\nThe video is bookended by scenes framing the context. When the Backstreet Boys' bus breaks down, their bus driver (Antonio Fargas) insists that they spend a night at a nearby haunted mansion while he gets help. It then shows Brian Littrell preparing to sleep in one of the bedrooms. While he is in bed, he pulls out a scary animal from under his covers, making him scream in horror. The musical portion of the video then starts, playing as a dream sequence in which each band member appears as a different movie monster: Littrell as a werewolf; Howie Dorough as Dracula; Nick Carter as a mummy; AJ McLean as Erik, the Phantom of the Opera; and Kevin Richardson as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in a half-transformed Two-Face-like state. Throughout the beginning and middle of the song, the band, as monsters, mainly appear in their own individual vignettes related to their character; during the final chorus, they collectively appear in the foyer of the mansion, performing a dance routine with a group of additional"

It was released as the first single from their second international studio album Backstreet's Back in June 1997, and the third single from their self-titled debut US studio album in March 1998. The music video was directed by American director Joseph Kahn.\nZomba chairman Clive Calder suggested that \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" should be released as a single, which was met with resistance from Jive Records president Barry Weiss, as he believed that it would be weird to have a song called \"Backstreet's Back\" on the Backstreet Boys' first US album. The band suggested it could just mean that they were back home. After Canadian markets began playing the song, US markets near the border began picking the song up. They met with Weiss and asked that the song be added to the US album after the first million units had already been produced.\nThere are two versions of the song. The international album features the album or 7\" version, which is the standard recording. The US album features the extended version of the song which includes an extended breakdown section, but cuts the bridge. The music video for the song was cut to both versions of the song, with the extended video released to the US market, and the standard video released everywhere else.\nLarry Flick from Billboard commented that \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" contained a \"contagious dance/pop beat and catchy hook that perfectly showcases this talented group's voices\".\nWritten and produced by Max Martin and Denniz Pop, \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" is one of the Backstreet Boys' most successful singles to date, reaching number 4 in the US Billboard Hot 100, running 22 weeks, and number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. It is certified platinum in the United States with 2.1 million sales.\n\nThe music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, and filmed in Los Angeles, California from June 16\u201318, 1997. Kahn was contacted by Jive to direct a project with a \"white Jodeci\". Initially unaware who the Backstreet Boys were, he was shocked by the group's European sales figures after being given a cassette tape and publicity release about them. Initially a grunge and hip-hop director, he wanted to explore the pop genre, since he grew up listening to music from the 1980s.\nThe haunted house aesthetic was based on a treatment Kahn envisioned for rapper Ice Cube a few months prior, and was inspired by the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\". Kahn and the group wanted Antonio Fargas to portray the bus driver, as they were fans of Starsky & Hutch. The video shoot lasted for 36 hours, with Nick Carter's mummy shot being filmed last. Jive did not get behind the concept of the band in costumes or the $1 million requirements, and did not believe MTV would respect the video. The band ultimately had to put up their own money to shoot the video and had to fight with the label to get reimbursed once it was successful. The video premiered outside the United States in July 1997, although viewers with MuchMusic USA were able to see it as at the time it was still mostly a simulcast of the Canadian channel. In a 2017 interview with Billboard, Kahn stated that the video's impact broadened his view of pop culture, while creating a new scene in the US.\nThe video is bookended by scenes framing the context. When the Backstreet Boys' bus breaks down, their bus driver (Antonio Fargas) insists that they spend a night at a nearby haunted mansion while he gets help. It then shows Brian Littrell preparing to sleep in one of the bedrooms. While he is in bed, he pulls out a scary animal from under his covers, making him scream in horror. The musical portion of the video then starts, playing as a dream sequence in which each band member appears as a different movie monster: Littrell as a werewolf; Howie Dorough as Dracula; Nick Carter as a mummy; AJ McLean as Erik, the Phantom of the Opera; and Kevin Richardson as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in a half-transformed Two-Face-like state. Throughout the beginning and middle of the song, the band, as monsters, mainly appear in their own individual vignettes related to their character; during the final chorus, they collectively appear in the foyer of the mansion, performing a dance routine with a group of additional"

The ballad was written and produced by Max Martin and Rami, and co-written by Lisa Miskovsky.\nThe song earned a Grammy Award nomination during the 44th Grammy Awards for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\nDue to the success of rival boy band NSYNC's album No Strings Attached selling over 2.4 million copies in its first week, there were high expectations from industry experts and fans that the Backstreet Boys' next album Black & Blue would break the first week sales of No Strings Attached. \"Shape of My Heart\" was widely anticipated as the lead single of Black & Blue, which would follow their previous singles \"Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)\", \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\", and \"I Want It That Way\".\n\"Shape of My Heart\" is stated to be \"the sound of a boy band becoming a group of men\". It consists of a bubblegum chorus, clean pop structure, along with various vocal harmonies from Max Martin's production. It also contains soft-pop guitar, low-key percussion, and a lyrical emphasis on the reflection of past mistakes.\nThe song is performed in D major with a key change to E major at the third chorus.\nCraig Seymour of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a C- in his review, stating that the \"mid-tempo ballad is more a joyless retread than a maturing makeover.\" Jason Lipshutz of Billboard considered the song to be a disappointment, stating that it was a muted mid-tempo reflection on mistakes and weaknesses, as well as being \"miscast as a flashy comeback that would return serve against *NSYNC and hijack pop radio for months\".\nThe song debuted at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, giving the group their sixth top-10 single in the US, while reaching number 8 on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart. It also topped the charts in Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland as well as the top 10 in several other countries.\n\nThe music video for \"Shape of My Heart\" was directed by Matthew Rolston  at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. The entire video is shot in monochrome with a blue tint, creating a black and blue atmosphere in reference to the album's name. Rolston was inspired by \"classic photography\", utilizing the blue tint to evoke earlier periods of photography, as well as showcasing a mature side of the band in place of their previous over-the-top videos. On MTV's Total Request Live the music video broke the Backstreet Boys' own record for longest-running number-one song, which was previously held by \"Larger Than Life\" (1999). The video spent 61 days at the top position. As of September 2021, the music video has over 222 million views on YouTube.\nThe video shows the Backstreet Boys rehearsing lines for a production titled Shape of My Heart, printed on a script around an empty theater in places such as the backstage wall, and on the stage. The actress Sara Foster and the actor Ryan McTavish rehearse on the stage while another couple watches from a desk in front of the audience. Each of the people introduced are also featured alongside the Backstreet Boys as they rehearse.\nThe song was the last single by the Backstreet Boys to peak in the top-ten of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as they outgrew their teenage years. Jason Lipshutz stated that the song's influence spread to future Backstreet Boys singles such as \"Incomplete\", \"Show 'Em (What You're Made Of)\", and \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\", concluding that although it wasn't a smash, it has become \"an important inflection point for one of the era\u2019s biggest groups\".\nIn 2008, one of the song's writers, Lisa Miskovsky, released her own version of the song, \"Another Shape of My Heart\" on her 2008 album Last Year's Songs: Greatest Hits.\nUK maxi single\n\"Shape of My Heart\" \u2013 3:50\n\"All I Have to Give\" (A Cappella) \u2013 3:48\n\"The One\" (Jack D.

It was released on April 12, 1999, as the lead single from their third studio album, Millennium. It was written by Max Martin and Andreas Carlsson, while Martin and Kristian Lundin produced it. The pop ballad talks about a relationship strained by matters of emotional or physical distance.\nCritically, the song was met with positive reception, with many critics commending its catchiness, also calling it the pop ballad of the year. The song was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Song and Record of the Year, and has been included in lists by Blender, MTV, Rolling Stone and VH1.\n\"I Want It That Way\" is the Backstreet Boys\u2019 signature song, and commercially it reached the number-one spot in more than 25 countries, including Austria, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for eight non-consecutive weeks, while it topped the Adult and Top 40 Mainstream charts.\nThe song has been widely covered and parodied by a range of artists, including other boy bands such as JLS and One Direction, while its music video, directed by Wayne Isham, received famous parodies, including Blink 182 on their music video for \"All the Small Things\", Big Time Rush on their music video for \"Like Nobody's Around\", their music video for 'Worldwide', and the Wanted on their video for \"Walks Like Rihanna\". The original music video received four VMA nominations, winning Viewer's Choice.\nAfter the success of their first two albums, Backstreet Boys (1996) and Backstreet's Back (1997), the band recorded their third studio album, during 1998 and 1999. When the members of the Backstreet Boys came to Stockholm in November 1998 for a two-week recording engagement, they were eventually presented the demo of \"I Want It That Way\", which at the time only consisted of the main chorus. Upon leaving Sweden on November 16 for a November 17 Oprah taping (Dec. 3 airing), vocals for the song had been completed in two days.\nOriginally, \"Larger Than Life\" was intended to be the lead single, following the similar formula of their first two albums, having an upbeat lead single. However, after hearing the final version of \"I Want It That Way\", the group wanted to move in a more mature direction, by utilizing a mid-tempo track as the lead single. Zomba Recording executives had to be convinced to approve of the song as the first single, due to them citing that the group could \"alienate fans\" with a mid-tempo song that had vague lyrical meaning. In the end, press information in the form of snippets was authorized for release to radio stations in March 1999, to precede the song's release to radio in April.\nOn August 19, 2011, China's Ministry of Culture released a list of 100 songs including the then twelve-year-old \"I Want it That Way\" that were required to be removed from the Internet. This purge came about because the Ministry claimed that these songs had been released without first being subjected to a mandatory screening process conducted by Ministry officials as per official government policy. Media sites were given until September 15 to delete the named songs or face unspecified penalties. The Chinese government claims that such measures are necessary for national security purposes.\n\"I Want It That Way\" was written by Andreas Carlsson and Max Martin, while Martin and Kristian Lundin produced the track. The acoustic-guitar arpeggio riff, which forms the song's intro and reiterates throughout the verses, was written at the very end of the recording sessions and was, according to Carlsson, inspired by \"Nothing Else Matters\" by Metallica.\nThe song is written in the key of A major. At approximately the 2 minute, 25 seconds point of the song, the key modulates to B major, and again to C# major. Their vocals span from E\u2084 to B\u2085. An alternate version of the song with different lyrics was written and recorded by the band in January 1999. The version was included in some early demo presses of the album. In the alternate version, the song has the opposite message (\"I love it when I hear you say, I want it that way\"). \n The alternative lyrics were written by Martin and Carlsson in collaboration with Mutt Lange.\nThe alternate version was leaked on the internet via Napster and other methods in the early 2000s,"

It was released in Europe on December 13, 1995 as the second single from their self-titled debut album.\nThe song was written by singer-songwriters Eugene Wilde and Albert Manno and produced by Veit Renn and Timmy Allen. It was later included on their US debut album as well as their fourth single in the US right after \"Backstreet's Back\" reissue on March 31, 1998.\nThe song replaced \"I'll Never Find Someone Like You\" on the album, which was to be the band's first single. The band's label, Jive Records, had not committed to using the song for the band, and as a result, it was offered to singer Keith Martin, who accepted it and released it as a single on the Bad Boys soundtrack, and his own albums It's Long Overdue and All the Hits. Brian Littrell discovered this when he heard Martin's song play on the radio one day.\n\"I'll Never Break Your Heart\" was supposedly recorded over two weeks, because Littrell and AJ McLean, the two lead vocalists on the song, had colds. In an interview with Billboard, AJ McLean stated that the song \"was the longest recording for any single BSB record in Backstreet history\", as they had to manually rewind the tape in order to add brand new vocals in the track while they were sick.\nIn October 2014, the group took ownership of the master recording of the song as part of a settlement agreement with their ex-manager, Lou Pearlman's bankruptcy estate.\nPan-European magazine Music & Media wrote that \"with the up-tempo, infectious We've Got It Goin' On still in the Benelux, German and Swiss top 10, the Backstreet Boys slowed their crystal clear vocals down to make one of those smooth R&B ballads which are typically aimed for the US market.\" A reviewer from Music Week rated it four out of five, adding, \"The soppiness factor is in to full effect on this romantic ballad, which displays the boys' vocal excellence. A November tour will help this become another top five hit.\" Chuck Arnold from People Magazine said that Backstreet Boys gave their \"smoothest Boyz II Men impression\" on this R&B ballad, adding that \"they make you believe every word of their vow to do no harm.\"\nThe song was first released in Europe in December 1995, then in 1996 for a few other markets, and subsequently was re-released June 1998 of the US debut. The song peaked at number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US, but fared better on the Adult Contemporary chart, where it became the group's first number one song on this chart. Outside the US, the song peaked at #8 on the UK Singles Chart and also went to the Top 10 in Australia, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.\nTwo music videos were released for \"I'll Never Break Your Heart\".\nThe video released in conjunction with the original single release follows a group of girls, one of whom has just broken up with her boyfriend as explained in the video's preface. The band members are on a ski vacation, and each partners up with one of the girls. Brian Littrell gets together with the girl who had just broken up with her boyfriend. The girl Kevin Richardson is matched with was his then-girlfriend and now-wife Kristin Willits, as she was asked by the director to be featured in the video as an extra. The group had not skied before or seen snow, and would constantly fall off after the cameras stopped rolling. This original video was filmed on November 1995 in Snowbird, Utah. It first aired in December 1995 in Germany, France, and other nations in Western Europe.\nThe second video, directed by Bille Woodruff, was released to MTV in June 1998 for the US market. It later appeared as the first video on Total Request Live. The video features each band member singing in their own uniquely styled apartment which are stacked atop one another in a tall building. Late in the video, each of the members is shown to have a girl in their apartment. The group is also shown singing together in a cylindrical tunnel which has a rotating round porthole at the near end, though which the camera observes. A version of the video was also released for the Spanish version of the song. \nThe dog in Littrell's apartment was actually his dog, and the lady in his apartment was his then-girlfriend, now-wife Leighanne Wallace."

It was released as the first single from their second international studio album Backstreet's Back in June 1997, and the third single from their self-titled debut US studio album in March 1998. The music video was directed by American director Joseph Kahn.\nZomba chairman Clive Calder suggested that \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" should be released as a single, which was met with resistance from Jive Records president Barry Weiss, as he believed that it would be weird to have a song called \"Backstreet's Back\" on the Backstreet Boys' first US album. The band suggested it could just mean that they were back home. After Canadian markets began playing the song, US markets near the border began picking the song up. They met with Weiss and asked that the song be added to the US album after the first million units had already been produced.\nThere are two versions of the song. The international album features the album or 7\" version, which is the standard recording. The US album features the extended version of the song which includes an extended breakdown section, but cuts the bridge. The music video for the song was cut to both versions of the song, with the extended video released to the US market, and the standard video released everywhere else.\nLarry Flick from Billboard commented that \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" contained a \"contagious dance/pop beat and catchy hook that perfectly showcases this talented group's voices\".\nWritten and produced by Max Martin and Denniz Pop, \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" is one of the Backstreet Boys' most successful singles to date, reaching number 4 in the US Billboard Hot 100, running 22 weeks, and number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. It is certified platinum in the United States with 2.1 million sales.\n\nThe music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, and filmed in Los Angeles, California from June 16\u201318, 1997. Kahn was contacted by Jive to direct a project with a \"white Jodeci\". Initially unaware who the Backstreet Boys were, he was shocked by the group's European sales figures after being given a cassette tape and publicity release about them. Initially a grunge and hip-hop director, he wanted to explore the pop genre, since he grew up listening to music from the 1980s.\nThe haunted house aesthetic was based on a treatment Kahn envisioned for rapper Ice Cube a few months prior, and was inspired by the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\". Kahn and the group wanted Antonio Fargas to portray the bus driver, as they were fans of Starsky & Hutch. The video shoot lasted for 36 hours, with Nick Carter's mummy shot being filmed last. Jive did not get behind the concept of the band in costumes or the $1 million requirements, and did not believe MTV would respect the video. The band ultimately had to put up their own money to shoot the video and had to fight with the label to get reimbursed once it was successful. The video premiered outside the United States in July 1997, although viewers with MuchMusic USA were able to see it as at the time it was still mostly a simulcast of the Canadian channel. In a 2017 interview with Billboard, Kahn stated that the video's impact broadened his view of pop culture, while creating a new scene in the US.\nThe video is bookended by scenes framing the context. When the Backstreet Boys' bus breaks down, their bus driver (Antonio Fargas) insists that they spend a night at a nearby haunted mansion while he gets help. It then shows Brian Littrell preparing to sleep in one of the bedrooms. While he is in bed, he pulls out a scary animal from under his covers, making him scream in horror. The musical portion of the video then starts, playing as a dream sequence in which each band member appears as a different movie monster: Littrell as a werewolf; Howie Dorough as Dracula; Nick Carter as a mummy; AJ McLean as Erik, the Phantom of the Opera; and Kevin Richardson as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in a half-transformed Two-Face-like state. Throughout the beginning and middle of the song, the band, as monsters, mainly appear in their own individual vignettes related to their character; during the final chorus, they collectively appear in the foyer of the mansion, performing a dance routine with a group of additional"

The first album it appears on is his 1984 album You've Got a Good Love Comin'. It reached No. 7 on the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles chart when originally released in the spring of 1984, and was played at the 1984 Republican National Convention with President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan in attendance, but the song gained greater prominence during the Gulf War in 1990 and 1991 as a way of boosting morale. As a result of its newfound popularity, Greenwood re-recorded the track for his 1992 album American Patriot.\nThe popularity of the song rose again sharply after the September 11 attacks and during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the song was re-released as a single, re-entering the country music charts at No. 16 and peaking at No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart in 2001. A new version of the song was recorded in 2003 and released as \"God Bless the U.S.A. 2003.\" \nThe song has sold over a million copies in the United States by July 2015.\nGreenwood wrote God Bless the U.S.A. in response to his feelings about the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. He said that he \"wanted to write it my whole life. When I got to that point, we were doing 300 days a year on the road, and we were on our fourth or fifth album on MCA. I called my producer, and I said I have a need to do this. I've always wanted to write a song about America, and I said we just need to be more united.\" As for writing the song itself, Greenwood wrote that it more or less \"wrote itself\", and that the lyrics flowed naturally from the music as a reflection of his pride to be American.\nThe reason behind the cities chosen in the song Greenwood says, \"I'm from California, and I don't know anybody from Virginia or New York, so when I wrote it\u2014and my producer and I had talked about it\u2014[we] talked about the four cities I wanted to mention, the four corners of the United States. It could have been Seattle or Miami but we chose New York City and Los Angeles, and he suggested Detroit and Houston because they both were economically part of the basis of our economy\u2014Motortown and the oil industry, so I just poetically wrote that in the bridge.\" During and post his presidency, Donald Trump used the song as his entrance tune at the beginning of all of his rallies. Additionally Greenwood, a fervent Trump supporter, himself performed the song at such rallies on multiple occasions.\nIn the song, the singer sings about how, if he were to lose everything he had and had to start again from scratch, he would do it in the United States because he believes his freedom is guaranteed in America. He remembers how other Americans in history had died to secure this freedom, and declares that if he is ever called upon to defend the US today, he will gladly stand up and fight because he loves the country.\nA music video was released for this song in 1984, depicting Greenwood as a farmer who loses the family farm. The video was produced and edited by L.\u00a0A. Johnson and directed by Gary Burden. A second video was released in 1991, also on VHS, and was directed by Edd Griles. A third music video was also released after the September 11, 2001, attacks. A fourth music video in collaboration with U.S. Air Force Singing Sergeants and a cappella group Home Free was released on June 30, 2020.\n\"God Bless the U.S.A.\" debuted on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart for the week of May 26, 1984.\n\n\nIn 1989, Greenwood released a Canadian version of this song called \"God Bless You Canada\".\nPop group Jump5 covered the song for the September 11 attacks in October 2001, altering some of the lyrics: \"And I had to start again with just my children and my wife\" became \"And I had to start again with just my family by my side\", and \"I thank my lucky stars\" became \"I thank my God above\" to reflect the group's Christian values.\nDolly Parton recorded the song for her 2003 patriotic album, For God and Country.\nIn 2003, the song was performed by the American Idol season two finalists and released as a single, with part of the proceeds going to the American Red Cross. It raised $155,000 for the charity. It reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it was certified gold by the RIAA the same year.\nAgain, following the death"

It is the title track from her seventh studio album Ray of Light (1998), and was released as the album's second single on May 6, 1998, by Maverick Records. The song was also included on the compilation albums GHV2 (2001) and Celebration (2009). Written by Madonna, William Orbit, Clive Maldoon, Dave Curtiss, Christine Leach, and produced by Madonna and Orbit, \"Ray of Light\" is based on Curtiss Maldoon's \"Sepheryn\" and is an electronic dance song with techno, trance, Eurodance, and disco influences. \"Ray of Light\" consists of a main synth sound oscillating on the primary musical note, and an electric guitar riff. Lyrically, the song has a theme of freedom.\nThe song has received critical acclaim by music critics, for its club-friendly, electronic sound, lyrics, and \"emotional warmth\". The song was also nominated for three Grammy Awards; for Record of the Year, Best Dance Recording, and Best Short Form Music Video, winning the last two. \"Ray of Light\" debuted and peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Madonna's highest debut on the chart to date. It also reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Internationally, the song reached the top five in Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Greece, Scotland, and Spain.\nAn accompanying music video for \"Ray of Light\" was directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund and shows scenes from different cities around the world, with Madonna singing the song in front of them. The video was critically acclaimed, receiving the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, as well as winning five awards at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. Later, Stefano Salvati accused her of plagiarizing the concept of a music video he directed for Biagio Antonacci in 1994. The song has been performed in three of Madonna's concert tours, the last being the Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008\u201309). It has been covered by a number of artists, and has been featured in several elements of popular culture, such as on the FOX show Glee, as well as different advertising campaigns.\nSince 1996, Madonna went through a number of \"life-changing experiences\" which included giving birth to her daughter Lourdes, gaining interest in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, as well as earning the title role on the film adaptation of the musical Evita (1996). A year later she started working on Ray of Light, her seventh studio album. Madonna wrote songs with William Orbit, Patrick Leonard, Rick Nowels and Babyface. The album would reflect the singer's changed perspectives about life. Author Carol Benson noted that it was a \"deeply spiritual dance record\", with the crux of it based on Madonna's career, her journey and the many identities she had assumed over the years. Motherhood had softened the singer emotionally, which was reflected in the songs. She started talking about ideas and used words which implied deep and personal thoughts, rather than the regular dance-floor anthemic tunes she had composed.\nMadonna worked primarily with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit and suggested that he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and \"Ray of Light\" was among these tracks. It is based on the track \"Sepheryn\" (1971), by English folk music duo Curtiss Maldoon (consisting of Dave Curtiss and Clive Maldoon). In 1996, English singer and songwriter Christine Leach, Maldoon's niece, had recorded her version of the track. Leach said she had always loved the duo's work and \"Sepheryn\" was her favorite. She worked for a time with Orbit and recorded a demo of \"Sepheryn\" over a melody on which he was working. Leach rewrote the chorus and also removed a few bits from the original composition. Orbit included it in the DAT thinking that Leach had written the song. After Madonna heard the demo she liked it, and reworked the lyrics to create \"Ray of Light\".\nThe track was released as the second single from the parent album on May 6, 1998 in the United States. Curtiss was not aware of the fact that Madonna had recorded \"Sepheryn\" as \"Ray of Light\" and heard it for the first time being played on the radio. He \"couldn't believe it\" and was initially a bit annoyed, but became pleased with what Madonna had done with his original composition. He was also satisfied with the 15% royalties he received as songwriter credit. Madonna took 30% royalties, another 15%"

It was released as the lead single from Nirvana's third and final studio album, In Utero, in August 1993, and appears as the third track. It was one of two songs from the album mixed by Scott Litt to augment the original production by producer Steve Albini.\nThough Nirvana's record company DGC Records did not release a physical single in the United States, fearing it might damage album sales, \"Heart-Shaped Box\" received much American radio airplay, reaching number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single made the top 10 in several countries, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Finland and New Zealand, and the top 40 in numerous other countries. The music video, directed by Anton Corbijn, garnered critical plaudits, and won two awards, including Best Alternative Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1994. \"Heart-Shaped Box\" was the last song Cobain performed live with Nirvana, on March 1, 1994, in Munich, Germany.\nKurt Cobain wrote \"Heart-Shaped Box\" in early 1992. Cobain forgot about the song for a while, but began working on it again when he and his wife, Courtney Love, moved to a house in the Hollywood Hills. In a 1994 Rolling Stone interview, Love said she overheard him working on the song's riff in a closet. She said she asked him if she could use the riff for one of her songs, to which he replied \"Fuck you!\" and closed the closet door. The couple shared a journal in which they would write lyrics; Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross noted that Love's songwriting sensibility informed Cobain's on the song. The song's name came from a heart-shaped box Love had given Cobain. However, Cobain had originally titled the song \"Heart-Shaped Coffin\".\nNirvana had difficulty completing the song. Cobain attempted to have the rest of the band complete the song during jam sessions. He said, \"I was trying to wait for [bassist Krist Novoselic] and [drummer Dave Grohl] to come up with something but it just turned into noise all the time.\" Cobain made one last attempt at completing the song; he was able to come up with a vocal melody and the band finally finished writing the song. Cobain said that when they completed \"Heart-Shaped Box\", \"We finally realized that it was a good song.\"\nIn January 1993, the band recorded a demo of \"Heart-Shaped Box\" during sessions with Craig Montgomery in the BMG Ariola studios in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; it was the first song recorded. The In Utero version was recorded in February 1993 by Steve Albini in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. Prior to the album's release, the track was remixed by Scott Litt. Cobain was unapologetic about the band's decision to remix it, and maintained that the vocals and bass were not prominent enough in the original mixes. Novoselic was also unhappy with the original mix of \"Heart-Shaped Box\". In a 1993 Chicago Sun-Times interview, he said the original effect used on the song's guitar solo sounded \"like a fucking abortion hitting the floor.\" When the song was remixed by Litt, Cobain took the opportunity to add acoustic guitar and vocal harmonies.\n\"Heart-Shaped Box\" is an alternative rock song that lasts for a duration of four minutes and thirty-nine seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in a 4/4 time signature, with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is in the key of G# minor, modulating to G# dorian on the verses, while Kurt Cobain's vocal range spans one octave, from the low note of G#\u2083 to the high note of G#\u2084.\nThe song has a basic sequence of G#\u2085\u2013E\u2085\u2013C#\u2085\u2013G#\u2013E\u2085\u2013C#\u2087 in the verses and G#\u2085\u2013E\u2085\u2013C#\u2087 during the chorus as its chord progression. Journalist Gillian Gaar described \"Heart-Shaped Box\" as \"the Nirvana formula personified, with a restrained, descending riff played through the verse, building in intensity to the cascading passion of the chorus\".\nCobain said that the chorus of \"Hey / Wait/  I've got a new complaint\" was an example of how he was perceived by the media. He said the song was inspired by documentaries about children"

It was written by Kirby Lauryen, Stint and John Hill, with production handled by the latter two. It was initially released through Hollywood, Island and Safehouse Records on August 24, 2017, as the first promotional single from Lovato's sixth studio album of the same name (2017).

It was finally mastered by Chris Gehringer and Will Quinnell.\nDuring the album pop-up exhibition in New York City, Lovato revealed that the song was \"really stuck\" with them when they heard it for the first time. They explained, \"At the time I was going through a breakup. It's about the vulnerability of coming out of a very serious relationship and having a tough time with it. It also at the same time calls out a big misconception with the line, 'You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody,' which again comes from that vulnerability with mixed emotions.\" In an interview with the BBC, Lovato named \"Tell Me You Love Me\" as their favorite track on the album, later explaining that \"It said exactly what I was wanting to tell that person. I wanted to hear them tell me that they loved me.\"\nLovato published a black-and-white teaser on August 23, 2017, on social media, announcing the new album, with \"Tell Me You Love Me\" playing in the background.

On March 23, 2018, the EP was re-released, and one remix of the song by Matrix & Futurebound was released.\n\"Tell Me You Love Me\" is written in the key of E\u266d minor with a tempo of 72 beats per minute in common time. The song follows a chord progression of E\u266dm\u2013D\u266d\u2013C\u266d, and Lovato's vocal range spans from the low note of A\u266d\u2083 to the high note of G\u266f\u2085.\n\"Tell Me You Love Me\" received acclaim from music critics, who mostly complimented its production and Lovato's vocals.

Jeff Benjamin of Fuse called the song a \"booming ballad\". Deepa Lakshmin of MTV News described Lovato's vocals as \"sweeping\".

The song is the album's sixth track, and was released as its first single. The song became one of Idol's biggest hits in the United States, where it reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, behind \"Vision of Love\" by Mariah Carey. It was also Idol's first, and only No. 1 hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. to date. In the UK, it stalled at No. 34.\n\"Cradle of Love\" is a rock song composed in common time and in the key of Bb major.\nThe song title is based on the saying \"robbing the cradle.\"\nThe video, directed by David Fincher, features footage of Idol singing in large painting frames throughout an apartment. The director made the decision to film Idol from the waist up as he was unable to walk due to injuries from a February 1990 motorcycle crash. The video also features Betsy Lynn George as a teenager who tries to seduce a modest and mild-mannered businessman played by Joshua Townshend-Zellner. The film makes use of clips from The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, but as Andrew Dice Clay (who played Fairlane) had been banned from MTV, he is not shown in any of the clips. The video was a huge hit and was placed in heavy rotation on MTV. Idol and George recreated the opening of the video for the 1991 Grammys. An alternative version of the video does not feature the movie's footage, instead depicting a man playing the guitar as heard in the track.\nAt the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for Best Male Video and Best Special Effects and won the award for Best Video from a Film.\nThis video was voted #33 on VH1's 50 Sexiest Video Moments.\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered this song as the opening track to their 1991 album The Chipmunks Rock the House.  In 1992, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic included the chorus as the first song in his polka medley \"Polka Your Eyes Out\" from his album Off the Deep End.\n\n\"Cradle of Love\" (4:39)\n\"311 Man\" (3:51)\n\"Cradle Of Love (DJ Edit)\" (4:05)\n\"311 Man\" (3:51)\n7\" promo includes DJ Edit mix.\n\"Cradle of Dub (extended remix)\"  (6:27)\n\"Cradle of Love (LP version)\" (4:39)\n\"Rob The Cradle Of Dub (Extended Mix)\" (5:07)\n\"311 Man\" (3:51)\nAlso released as 12\" picture disc (IDOLXP 14)\n\"Cradle Of Love (Edit)\" (4:09)\n\"Cradle of Dub (extended remix)\"  (6:27)\n\"Rob The Cradle Of Dub (Extended Mix)\" (5:07)\n\"311 Man\" (3:51)\nHis live performance of the song at the 1991 Grammy Awards was released on the 1994 album Grammy's Greatest Moments Volume I.\n\n\n\n\n\"Billy Idol | Awards\".

The song was released in August 1993 as the first single from the album Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell. The last six verses feature Crosby, who was credited only as \"Mrs. Loud\" in the album notes. She does not appear in the video, in which her vocals are lip-synched by Dana Patrick. Meat Loaf promoted the single with American singer Patti Russo.\nThe power ballad was a commercial success, reaching number one in 28 countries. The single was certified platinum in the United States and became Meat Loaf's first and only number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart, and was the best-selling single of 1993 in the United Kingdom. The song earned Meat Loaf a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo.\nThe timings in this article refer to the original album version. There are many shorter single and radio edits.\nThe song opens with a guitar played to sound like a revving motorcycle. Roy Bittan's piano begins to play along with the guitars and drums. The vocals begin at the 1:50 point. The opening vocals are accompanied by piano and backing vocals. The song then becomes much louder as the band, predominantly piano, plays the main melody for twenty seconds. An instrumental section follows the first verse and chorus, lasting over 45 seconds, with piano playing the title melody, accompanied by guitar and wordless background vocals by Todd Rundgren, Rory Dodd and Kasim Sulton. The lead vocals recommence with another verse. The phrase \"sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll\" was changed to \"Some days I just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock and roll\" on the recording, although Meat Loaf occasionally sings the original phrase in concert.\nEarlier, the lyrics \"I'd do anything for love, but I won't do that\" had been used in the song \"Getting So Excited\" (written by Alan Gruner), recorded by Bonnie Tyler in the album Faster Than the Speed of Night, which was produced by Steinman.\nAt the 9:28 point, the song transforms into a duet coda. The structure of the verses remains, but the woman now asks what the man would do. He answers in the affirmative for the first four sections.\nWoman:\n\nWill you make me some magic with your own two hands?\n\nCan you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?\n\nCan you give me something I can take home?\n\nMan:\n\nI can do that!\nThe song's tone changes for the final two sections, in which the woman, Lorraine Crosby on the original recorded version, predicts that the man would eventually do things to upset her and their relationship. Both times, he denies it.\nMeat Loaf says that the question, \"What is 'that'?\" is one of the most popular questions he is asked.\nEach verse mentions two things that the man would do for love, followed by one thing that he will not do. The title phrase repetition reasserts that he \"won't do that.\" Each mention of \"that\" is a reference to the particular promise that he made earlier in the same verse. The four things he says he will never do are:\n\"forget the way you feel right now\"\n\"forgive myself if we don't go all the way tonight\"\n\"do it better than I do it with you\"\n\"stop dreaming of you every night of my life\"\nAt the song's conclusion, the woman predicts two things that he will do: \"You'll see that it's time to move on\", and \"You'll be screwing around.\" To both of these, the male emphatically responds, \"I won't do that!\"\nIn his 1998 VH1 Storytellers special, Meat Loaf even explained it on stage using a blackboard and a pointer. In a 1993 promotional interview, Steinman states that the definition of \"that\" is fully revealed in the song in each of the several verses in which it is mentioned. This sense might have been more clear if the lyric had been \"and I won't do that\" instead of \"but I won't do that.\" It is possibly the use of \"but\" instead of \"and\" that leads to the ambiguity.\nIt sort of is a little puzzle and I guess it goes by - but they're all great things. 'I won't stop doing beautiful things and I won't do bad things.' It's very noble."

It was a number-one Billboard Hot 100 hit for two weeks in the summer of 1989. An edited version of the song is included in the imported version of the album Toy Soldiers: The Best of Martika.\nMartika wrote the song about a friend who was battling a cocaine addiction. \"I was a little hesitant because I had only written two songs before and they were light songs. I came up to Michael and said I wanted to write about drugs. It was the first time I got the nerve to write about something that was scary for me to talk about, so I did.\" According to an episode of VH-1's Pop-Up Video, in which \"Toy Soldiers\" was featured, the friend-in-question eventually conquered the addiction.\nThe song is performed in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 65 beats per minute in  time.  The song follows a chord progression of A\u2013B\u2013A\u2013B\u2013C\u266fm\u2013B\u2013C\u266fm\u2013G\u266fm\u2013C\u266fm\u2013B.\nBryan Buss of AllMusic retrospectively reviewed the Martika album, stating \"the big hit single, 'Toy Soldiers', works with its childlike vocals and lyrics, creating a haunting, effective dichotomy with its subject of drug addiction.\" Buss also highlighted the song as an album standout by labeling it an AMG Pick Track. Rob Theakston of Allmusic labeled the song as an AMG Pick Track on the 2005 compilation Toy Soldiers: The Best of Martika.\nThe song spent two weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. and New Zealand while reaching number five in both the United Kingdom and Australia. On Billboard's year-end chart for 1989, \"Toy Soldiers\" placed number 29. It was Martika's only number-one single in the U.S., and her highest-ranking single in the United Kingdom. The single was certified Gold in the United States by the RIAA.\nIn March and April 2009, VH1 ran a countdown of the 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s. \"Toy Soldiers\" placed at number 67 on the countdown, although Martika had three other top 40 hits: \"More Than You Know\" (number 18); \"I Feel the Earth Move\" (number 25); and \"Love... Thy Will Be Done\" (number 10).\nThe video for the song was directed by Jim Shea, who later became a regular in directing country music videos. Martika is seen singing with a waterfall in front of her (this was done by filming her in an empty pool with a water current flowing between her and the camera).\nMartika is the lead singer throughout the song and is joined on the chorus by some of her former castmates from Kids Incorporated: Stacy Ferguson (Fergie), Rahsaan Patterson, and Renee Sands, as well as later cast members Kimberly McCullough and Devyn Puett as backup vocalists (\"The Toy Soldiers\").\n7-inch single\n\"Toy Soldiers\" \u2013 4:52\n\"Exchange of Hearts\" \u2013 4:15\n3-inch single\n\"Toy Soldiers\" \u2013 4:52\n\"Exchange of Hearts\" \u2013 4:15\n\"It's Not What You're Doing\" \u2013 4:11\n12-inch single\n\"Toy Soldiers\" \u2013 4:52\n\"It's Not What You're Doing\" \u2013 4:11\n\"Exchange of Hearts\" \u2013 4:15\n\n\n\n\nMartika recorded and produced a Spanish version of \"Toy Soldiers\" renaming it \"Como Un Juguete\", though it was not as successful as the original English version. She also recorded the song in Japanese.\nEminem's 2005 single \"Like Toy Soldiers\" features samples from \"Toy Soldiers\". A sample of Martika's singing the chorus is used as the chorus of the Eminem version. The subject of the Eminem song is markedly different from the Martika song, concerning violence and murder linked to rap music rather than drug addiction. The sample is played faster than the original version with an added drum beat. The final chorus of Martika's song is used as the chorus of Eminem's version.\nMy Vitriol covered the song for their 2007 EP A Pyrrhic Victory.\nSilversun Pickups covered the song for a 2020 7\" single titled Toy Soldiers.\nAmber Van Day's 2020 single Kids in the Corner features melodic hints from \"Toy Soldiers\".\nList of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1989\n\"American single   certifications \u2013 Martika \u2013 Toy Soldiers\".

The original version was released as the album's fourth single; Ja Rule of Murder Inc. Records wrote and was featured on a newly-written version of the song titled \"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\", which was featured on a re-issue of J.Lo in July 2001, on Lopez's remix album J to tha L\u2013O! The Remixes (2002), and on Ja Rule's third studio album Pain Is Love (2001).\nThe original album version was well received by music critics, who complimented the 1980s-esque style and composition, while the remix received mixed reviews for its lyrics. However, both songs have been appreciated for the use of the samples.\nThe \"Murder Remix\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, beginning September 8, 2001, and also topped the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The two songs are essentially different songs with the same title. Much controversy followed the song after its release. Two music videos were made for the track, with the first depicting Lopez driving a motorcycle throughout the highway and featuring a dance break, while the second video features Ja Rule and Irv Gotti.\nThe original version of \"I'm Real\" was recorded by Lopez for her second studio album, J.Lo (2001) which had 14 other tracks. Released on January 23, 2001, J.Lo became a commercial success, debuting at the summit of the Billboard 200. Describing J.Lo as a \"reflection of who I am, my own experiences\", Lopez said: \"My fans call me J.Lo. Giving the album this title is my way of telling them that this is for them in appreciation of their support.\" Prior to its release, she knew how important it was to \"stay fresh\", and decided to tweak her public image by dying her hair and changing her stage name to J.Lo. Lopez felt that she had more \"creative control\" on J.Lo than her debut album On the 6 (1999). The album was reissued on July 24, 2001 (Lopez's thirty-second birthday), now containing the remix version of \"I'm Real\" featuring Ja Rule.\nThe original version of \"I'm Real\" was written by Jennifer Lopez, Troy Oliver, Cory Rooney and Leshan David Lewis, with production being handled by Oliver and Rooney. Lyrically, the singer offers voluptuous good times as long as her lover \"don't ask me where I've been.\" While she brags that she's made him fall in love, a male voice chants, \"She's a bad, bad bitch.\" Oliver developed the song's concept while Lewis suggested the use of a loop from the song \"Firecracker\" (1978) by Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra from their self-titled album. After hearing the instrumental track, Lopez and Rooney wrote \"I'm Real\", which she said \"was the first time I ever wrote a melody. I just love the hook of the song. I wrote it, so it\u2019s kind of personal.\" Lopez recorded the song that day, and called in her boyfriend at the time Sean Combs to record the lyric, \"She's a bad, bad bitch.\" Rooney revealed: \"She wrote that and she had him stop what he was doing, leave his studio, come across town and just go in the vocal booth and say that one part. Then she said, 'OK, now you can leave.'\"\nUrban radio stations were disappointed that J.Lo had not produced a single that catered to their audiences, and Epic Records knew that they needed the support of both urban and pop radio. After the album began to decline on the charts, Rooney suggested to Tommy Mottola that the song be remixed, which prompted Mottola to enlist Ja Rule of Murder Inc Records. Ja Rule admitted that he was \"thrown\" when he heard the song, saying: \"I don't do dance music, so what do you want me to do to this?\" Along with Irv Gotti, Ja Rule wrote the Murder remix for \"I'm Real\", which utilizes samples from \"All Night Long\" (1983) by Mary Jane Girls and \"Mary Jane\" by Rick James. \"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\" was produced by Gotti and 7 Aurelius, and was recorded at Record Plant in Hollywood, California and Crackhouse Studios in New York City. Singer Ashanti recorded the demo version of the remix, and provided background vocals for the final version. Ja Rule opens the remix by screaming \"What's my motherfucking name?\", to which Lopez responds \"R-U-L-E\". However, these lyrics resulted in common confusion among listeners, with many having heard \"Are you Ellie?\" instead.\nFollowing the release of \"I'm Real (Murder"

Written and produced by Rico Love, Earl Hood, and Eric Goudy II, the track originally belonged to R. Kelly. He then gave the song to Monica and the label presented the song to Brandy, who expressed her wish to record a duet. After Clive Davis authorized it, they went to a recording studio located in Miami, Florida to record the track. Three different versions were made, with one being released as the official first single from Monica's seventh studio album New Life on February 10, 2012, through RCA Records. It is the first time Monica and Brandy worked together since they collaborated on \"The Boy Is Mine\" (1998).\nMusically, \"It All Belongs to Me\" is a midtempo R&B ballad. Lyrically, the song is a female empowerment anthem in which both singers claims their belongings as they leave their abusive boyfriends behind. The chorus has references to MacBook and Facebook. \"It All Belongs to Me\" also received several comparisons to Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles' single \"Irreplaceable\" (2006). Following the release of the single, Brandy revealed that she expected female listeners to love the song. \"It All Belongs to Me\" was well received by the public. However, it received mixed reviews from contemporary critics. Most critics praised both singers' vocal performance, but were disappointed with the track, commenting that the hype behind it was big, but also noting that the track wouldn't be as successful as \"The Boy Is Mine\". \"It All Belongs to Me\" has reached number 23 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Chris Robinson. It premiered on VH1 on March 5, 2012. The video was inspired by the films Thelma & Louise (1991) and Waiting to Exhale (1995), and portrays the singers in dysfunctional relationships and helping each other in both situations. Monica and Brandy promoted the song doing several performances, radio and television interviews. The singers were also going to perform the track on the Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Party in 2012; however, the performance was cancelled following Whitney Houston's death.\nBrandy and Monica first worked together in 1997, on a song titled \"The Boy is Mine\". Created as a solo track, Brandy originally recorded the song alone. After listening to the result, however, she and Rodney Jerkins thought it would work better as a duet, an idea which was further inspired by Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson's 1982 hit duet \"The Girl Is Mine\". Jerkins, who produced the track, later claimed that both singers \"didn't get along\" during production and that he and Dexter Simmons remixed the track seven times to keep everything even. Monica later spoke about her relationship with Brandy in an interview with WZMX, stating, \"we were young. We could barely stay in the room with each other. By no means was it jealousy or envy. She and I are polar opposites and instead of embracing that, we used our differences as reasons not to be amongst each other.\"\nLater in 2011, it was reported that producer Rico Love was working with Monica on her seventh studio album, New Life. Love then conceived a track titled \"It All Belongs to Me\", which was written as a loose sequel to \"The Boy is Mine\". He stated that \"It All Belongs to Me\" is essentially picking up where \"The Boy is Mine\" left off. \"It's a very soulful R&B song with pop sensibilities. I wanted to make sure I made it a classic R&B record, but I definitely wanted to make sure that it had enough appeal to cross over and become a Top 40 record\". \"It All Belongs to Me\" was released as an official single on February 10, 2012, through RCA Records. The song is also slated to appear on both singers' albums.\nIn April 2012, Monica revealed to Rap-Up that the song was initially produced for and belonged to R&B singer and producer R. Kelly and was intended to be part of his eleventh studio album, Write Me Back. She further explained that she actually \"had to really go to him and ask him: 'Can I take this song, I really wanna take this song and put it on my new album'\". Kelly ended up giving the song to her, which resulted in Monica thanking him \"from the bottom of [her] heart\". The label then brought up the idea to her to put Brandy on the song, which was initially intended as a solo song.\nAfter \"It All Belongs to Me\" was presented to Monica, the singer revealed that she wanted to record a duet with Brandy, following their first released in 1998. Brandy also had plans to record a new duet with Monica. After talking to RCA and Chameleon Records executives Peter Edge and Breyon Prescott, both singers"

The lyrics were written by Barry Mason, and the music by Les Reed, who also contributed the title and theme of the song. It earned Reed and Mason the 1968 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.\nAlthough the song is a soulful number set in triple metre, the underlying genre may be considered to be a power ballad in the British ballad tradition.   Produced by Peter Sullivan, Jones's version features a big-band accompaniment set to a flamenco rhythm. The pitch of the final note is A4. Flamenco was a surprising choice, since there is no reference to Spain anywhere in the song. Possibly, it was because of similarities to the plot of \"Carmen\", in which Don Jos\u00e9 stabs Carmen to death when she tells him she is leaving him for another man.\nThe song tells the story of a man who passes his girlfriend's window and sees her inside making love to another man.  He waits outside all night, and then confronts her in the morning, only to have her laugh in his face. He stabs her to death, and then waits for the police to come break down the door and arrest him. The lyrics unfold from the killer's point of view, and are filled with his, often contradictory, emotions. He speaks of Delilah in possessive terms, but also refers to himself as her \"slave.\" He asks his dead girlfriend to \"forgive\" him, but still clearly sees himself as having been wronged by her.\nWhen Jones performed the song on The Ed Sullivan Show, the censors insisted that the line \"At break of day when the man drove away\" be changed to \"At break of day I was still 'cross the way\", as the original version implied he had spent the night with Delilah. Jones later described the change as \"such bullshit\".\nIn a two-year court case in The High Court of Justice, 1983 -M- No.1566 , Barry Mason's ex-wife Sylvan Whittingham, the daughter of Bond film Thunderball screenwriter, Jack Whittingham, claimed she had written half the lyrics of \"Delilah\" and several other songs. The legal battle that was settled out of court in 1986.\nTom Jones' recording reached No. 1 in the charts of several countries, including Germany and Switzerland. It reached No 2 in the British charts in March 1968 and was the sixth-best selling single of that year. The US Billboard chart records its highest position as 15.\n\n\n\n\n\nWelsh rugby fans have sung \"Delilah\" as an unofficial anthem since at least as early as the 1970s; it was referred to in the lyrics of one of the verses of Max Boyce's \"Hymns and Arias\": \"We sang 'Cwm Rhondda' and 'Delilah', damn they sounded both the same\". Tom Jones performed it before Wales's rugby victory over England at Wembley Stadium in 1999. As of 2003, the Welsh Rugby Union played the song in Millennium Stadium before matches; the words to the song were shown on the big screens and the crowd sang along.\nIn 2014, Dafydd Iwan, former president of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, called for Welsh rugby supporters to stop singing \"Delilah\" at matches, asserting that the song  \"trivialise[s] the idea of murdering a woman\".  Jones dismissed Iwan's claims, stating: \"I don\u2019t think [singers] are really thinking about it \u2026 If it\u2019s going to be taken literally, I think it takes the fun out of it.\" Prior to the 2016 Six Nations Championship rugby tournament, Welsh MP Chris Bryant claimed that the song was about the murder of a prostitute, and requested that the song not be sung by Welsh rugby fans as the lyrics glorify violence towards women.\nSupporters of Stoke City adopted \"Delilah\" as their club anthem in the 1990s. It was adopted by the fans after a supporter was heard singing it in a local pub. Some of the song's original lyrics were adapted for the football terraces, but the essence of the song remained the same.\nThe song featured in the 1990 film Edward Scissorhands. In the 2005 film Romance and Cigarettes, the original recording plays on a jukebox while Christopher Walken sings along and mimes the action. In the 2013 film American Hustle, the song plays at a bar while Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner sing along. The chorus of the song was referenced in the movie Hercules Returns. The song is featured prominently in the film Dream Horse.\nIn the \"Stage Fright\" episode of Only Fools and Horses, Tony Angelino, the \nSinging Dustman, is seen performing the song during his performance at the Down by the Riverside Club. As Tony suffers from rhotacism, he makes minor adaptations to the lyrics to eliminate R sounds.\nIn the"

The song was written by Benny Andersson, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson, with Anni-Frid Lyngstad singing the lead vocals. During recording sessions, it had the working titles of \"Ring It In\" and \"Number 1, Number 1\". The song was released in February 1977 as the album's fourth and final single from the group's album Arrival.\n\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" was recorded in 1976 at the Metronome studio in Stockholm and was released as a single in February 1977, becoming one of the group's more successful hits. The B-side was \"Happy Hawaii\", an arrangement of another ABBA song, \"Why Did It Have to Be Me?\", but with a different lead vocalist and lyrics. \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" was one of the early ABBA songs to deal with the break-up of a relationship. It predates the divorces of the ABBA members as well as further break-up songs to come: \"The Winner Takes It All\", \"One of Us\" and \"When All Is Said and Done\". Group member Benny Andersson named \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" as one of ABBA's best recordings in a 2004 interview, along with \"Dancing Queen\", \"The Winner Takes It All\" and \"When I Kissed the Teacher\". \"Conoci\u00e9ndome, Conoci\u00e9ndote\" is the Spanish-language version of the song. It was included in the compilation Oro: Grandes \u00c9xitos released in 1993 and Gracias Por La M\u00fasica released in 1980.\nThe music video depicts the band against various colored backdrops singing while facing each other, turning away as a new line is sung. At the end of the video, the band's female members are seen walking away through thick snow. The video was directed by future Academy Award nominee Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and is a landmark in his career alongside most other videos of the band which were directed by him.\n\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" proved to be one of ABBA's more successful singles, hitting #1 in West Germany (ABBA's sixth consecutive chart-topper there) and the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico and South Africa, and reaching the top 3 in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. It was a top 10 hit in Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand and Norway. In the United States, it became ABBA's sixth top 20 single, peaking at #14 on the Hot 100 and reaching #7 on Billboard's AC chart.\nIn the UK, \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" was one of the biggest singles of 1977. It also began a second run of three consecutive #1 singles for ABBA (followed by \"The Name of the Game\" and \"Take a Chance on Me\"), the group having had three consecutive #1 hit singles in 1976. As of September 2021, it is the group's third-biggest song in the country with 1.02 million chart sales, made up of pure sales and streams.\nBy September 1979 in West Germany \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" had sold over 300,000 copies.\nBillboard reviewed the song and described it as a \"melodically energetic but sad worded ditty about a romantic breakup.\"\n\nAnni-Frid Lyngstad \u2013 lead vocals\nAgnetha F\u00e4ltskog - backing vocals\nBj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nBenny Andersson \u2013 keyboards, synthesizer\nRutger Gunnarsson - bass, string arrangements\n\n\n\n\nA cover recorded in 1977 by the Top of the Poppers appears on the 2002 compilation album Knowing Me, Knowing You.\nThe Paraguayan singer Perla recorded a Spanish version, Conociendonos Mas for the 1977 album Relaciones Internacionales.\nCzech singer V\u011bra \u0160pinarov\u00e1 recorded a Czech version, Slune\u010dn\u00e9 pob\u0159e\u017e\u00ed (meaning Sunny Beach in Bulgaria), in 1977.\nThe French conductor Franck Pourcel recorded an instrumental version for his 1978 album Pourcel meets Abba.\nBritish singer Cilla Black recorded a cover for her 1980 album Especially for You.\nSwedish pop group A-Teens included the song as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of their debut album The ABBA Generation.\nDanny Wilson recorded a live version of the song, which was released on their bonus album Three-In-A-Bed Romp in 1991.

It was the lead single for their 2012 album Coexist. The song was written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft, bassist Oliver Sim, and percussionist Jamie xx, who also produced it.\nThe xx premiered the song on 14 May 2012 at their first live show since touring in 2010. Upon its release, \"Angels\" received positive reviews from music critics, who commended Croft's performance and the song's minimalist musical style. The song was remixed by electronic musician Four Tet, whose version was aired on BBC Radio on 19 September.\n\"Angels\" was recorded during the sessions for Coexist at The xx's recording studio in London. Its demo was originally recorded solely by Romy Madley Croft, who wrote the song's lyrics. Jamie xx said of the song's recording in an interview for Spin, \"It took a while to work out how to arrange it for the band. The demo was quite perfect, but it was just Romy. It took the entire length of the recording process to get it right.\"\n\"Angels\" is a sparsely-produced, gentle ballad about the idea of being in love. It has a measured pace and features slight vocals and whispered cadences by Croft, background baritone bass, subtle drum thuds, and coiling guitar lines. Pitchfork Media's Larry Fitzmaurice observes on the song \"lots of hollow space surrounding [that] add[s] intimacy.\" \"Angels\" opens with echoey guitar and Romy's vocals, which are at the front of the mix. Eerie snare rolls appear within a minute of the song, but quickly fade away. Arnold Pan of PopMatters writes that, in the context of Coexist, the song has its \"own sense of development\" and \"resolution\". Oliver Sim said of this moment of tension in the song, \"Early on, Jamie said something about the album being inspired by dance music, so everyone's expecting a house beat to drop halfway through\u2014which is hilarious because this is not a dance record.\"\nCroft's transparent lyrics express lovesick emotion, adoration, and private knowledge acquired from intimacy: \"You move through the room / Like breathing was easy / If someone believed me / They would be as in love with you as I am\". They also compare a relationship that ended prematurely to \"dreaming of angels, and leaving without them\". Her repetition of \"love\" in the song's chorus expresses the depth and intensity of the narrator's feeling. Priya Elan of NME opines that she repeats the word \"like she's been sucker-punched by the sheer intensity of her heart-shaped feeling. She's revelling in the joy of it, but also realising the utter failure of the simple four-letter word to express the depth of what she's experiencing.\" Croft said that the song is \"very positive lyrically\" and that its album \"goes through a few different stages, and this would be the lightest.\" Puja Patel of Spin characterizes its subject matter as \"loverlorn\" and observes a balance \"between honest[y], gut-wrenching desire and stalker-like idolization\".\nThe xx premiered the song at Electrowerkz in Islington, London on 14 May 2012, their first live show since 2010. They subsequently performed \"Angels\" on Conan on 24 July.\nPitchfork Media's Larry Fitzmaurice noted the song's \"percussive touch\" as an indication that \"the xx are changing ... slowly and subtly, two characteristics that's always been part of their central appeal.\" Si\u00e2n Rowe of NME called it \"a heart-meltingly perfect follow-on from their debut\", and the magazine's Priya Elan dubbed it \"the boldest Valentine the band have ever recorded.\" Michael Cragg of The Guardian commented that \"their ability to make minimalism seem warm and comforting [is] still intact.\" Allmusic's Heather Phares called the song a \"lovely album opener\" and wrote that the band's \"elegantly serpentine guitars \u2014 which recalled the Cure and Durutti Column on xx ... are now entirely their own\". The Quietus critiqued that \"it feels a bit more confident; where Oliver Sim and Madley-Croft's wordplay on their debut was tentative, there's a newfound directness\". Brendan Frank of Beats Per Minute commended Croft for \"delivering a simple love note to an anonymous recipient,\" adding that \"she does a magnificent job of carrying the piece on her own.\" Stephen Thompson of NPR called \"Angels\" a \"gentle love song made all the more disarming for its simplicity,\" writing that it \"ratchets up the tension using the fewest possible ingredients.\" In Australia, the song was voted by members of the public to number 19 on Triple J Hottest 100 of 2012.\nIn 2012, British band Bastille covered \"Angels\" alongside TLC's \"No Scrubs\" in a mash-up entitled \"No Angels\".

The song was written by Benny Andersson, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson, with Anni-Frid Lyngstad singing the lead vocals. During recording sessions, it had the working titles of \"Ring It In\" and \"Number 1, Number 1\". The song was released in February 1977 as the album's fourth and final single from the group's album Arrival.\n\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" was recorded in 1976 at the Metronome studio in Stockholm and was released as a single in February 1977, becoming one of the group's more successful hits. The B-side was \"Happy Hawaii\", an arrangement of another ABBA song, \"Why Did It Have to Be Me?\", but with a different lead vocalist and lyrics. \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" was one of the early ABBA songs to deal with the break-up of a relationship. It predates the divorces of the ABBA members as well as further break-up songs to come: \"The Winner Takes It All\", \"One of Us\" and \"When All Is Said and Done\". Group member Benny Andersson named \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" as one of ABBA's best recordings in a 2004 interview, along with \"Dancing Queen\", \"The Winner Takes It All\" and \"When I Kissed the Teacher\". \"Conoci\u00e9ndome, Conoci\u00e9ndote\" is the Spanish-language version of the song. It was included in the compilation Oro: Grandes \u00c9xitos released in 1993 and Gracias Por La M\u00fasica released in 1980.\nThe music video depicts the band against various colored backdrops singing while facing each other, turning away as a new line is sung. At the end of the video, the band's female members are seen walking away through thick snow. The video was directed by future Academy Award nominee Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and is a landmark in his career alongside most other videos of the band which were directed by him.\n\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" proved to be one of ABBA's more successful singles, hitting #1 in West Germany (ABBA's sixth consecutive chart-topper there) and the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico and South Africa, and reaching the top 3 in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. It was a top 10 hit in Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand and Norway. In the United States, it became ABBA's sixth top 20 single, peaking at #14 on the Hot 100 and reaching #7 on Billboard's AC chart.\nIn the UK, \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" was one of the biggest singles of 1977. It also began a second run of three consecutive #1 singles for ABBA (followed by \"The Name of the Game\" and \"Take a Chance on Me\"), the group having had three consecutive #1 hit singles in 1976. As of September 2021, it is the group's third-biggest song in the country with 1.02 million chart sales, made up of pure sales and streams.\nBy September 1979 in West Germany \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" had sold over 300,000 copies.\nBillboard reviewed the song and described it as a \"melodically energetic but sad worded ditty about a romantic breakup.\"\n\nAnni-Frid Lyngstad \u2013 lead vocals\nAgnetha F\u00e4ltskog - backing vocals\nBj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nBenny Andersson \u2013 keyboards, synthesizer\nRutger Gunnarsson - bass, string arrangements\n\n\n\n\nA cover recorded in 1977 by the Top of the Poppers appears on the 2002 compilation album Knowing Me, Knowing You.\nThe Paraguayan singer Perla recorded a Spanish version, Conociendonos Mas for the 1977 album Relaciones Internacionales.\nCzech singer V\u011bra \u0160pinarov\u00e1 recorded a Czech version, Slune\u010dn\u00e9 pob\u0159e\u017e\u00ed (meaning Sunny Beach in Bulgaria), in 1977.\nThe French conductor Franck Pourcel recorded an instrumental version for his 1978 album Pourcel meets Abba.\nBritish singer Cilla Black recorded a cover for her 1980 album Especially for You.\nSwedish pop group A-Teens included the song as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of their debut album The ABBA Generation.\nDanny Wilson recorded a live version of the song, which was released on their bonus album Three-In-A-Bed Romp in 1991.

The song was written by members will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo and Fergie, along with Joshua Alvarez, Stephen Shadowen, Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, and Julie Frost, for the group's sixth studio album, The Beginning (2010). It was announced on January 21, 2011, as the album's second single.\nThe song has been a success on the charts, reaching the top-five in many countries, such as New Zealand (their twelfth top 5),  Australia, Greece, France, United Kingdom and the United States, among others. The video for this song was filmed in Japan a week before the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami happened.\nAs of June 2011, the single has sold more than 2,462,000 digital units in the US.\nThe Beginning's second single was announced on The Black Eyed Peas' official website on January 21, 2011.\nRodney Jerkins and Julie Frost composed the basic song together, with Jerkins on piano and Frost contributing the lyrics and topline melody. The Darkchild production team of Tommy Brown and Bah then worked on the producing the track and contributing to the music composition before will.i.am and the Black Eyed Peas, in the words of Frost, \"cut it up and gave it their own twist\".\nMember Apl.de.ap told Beatweek Magazine that he wanted the song to be the follow-up to \"The Time (Dirty Bit)\", because \"It's a different tempo and it's also paying homage to the ladies.\"\nGroup member Taboo explained the meaning of the song to MTV News as: \"The message is knowing that when you're gone from somebody, especially when you're on tour, you can't get enough of them or you're just thinking about them and you just want to let them know that you're always there for them.\"\nAndy Gill from The Independent said, positively, that: \"other highlights include \"Just Can't Get Enough\" \u2013 not the Depeche Mode song \u2013 which vaults suddenly from the rare dignity of string-synth textures to a sweatily pumping techno finale\". Lewis Corner from Digital Spy rated it three stars (out of five) and commented that: \"The back-and-forth production \u2013 reminiscent of vintage arcade game Pong \u2013 comprises electronic synths and soft strings teamed with heavy beats and, of course, the obligatory vocoded \"mega switch up\" \u2013 prompting its transformation into a thumping techno endgame. Throw in some \"LOL\" text lingo and computerised vocals, and we can't help but think he's perhaps spent a little too much time in front of the PC for this one. You want to be careful Will, we hear they make your eyes go square\".\nThe music video for \"Just Can't Get Enough\" was directed by Ben Mor. It was shot over a three-day period in Tokyo, Japan primarily in the Ginza and Shibuya districts while the group was on a press tour. The opening clips show shots of the Ginza district. The video was shot between 3\u20135 March 2011, just one week before the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Fergie spoke of the clip and the natural disaster in Japan, saying, \"It was the easiest video I ever shot because it was us living our lives. I love that it's showing a true perspective of how it can sometimes be lonely on the road away from our loved ones. It also demonstrates the love and connection we have with Japan. Our heart goes out to all of the Japanese people who have been affected by this natural disaster.\" Taboo was also quoted saying \"It was an amazing moment in time because Japan has always been my favorite place on the planet. It was great to do our video there. God bless the Japanese. Our love goes out to them.\"\nThe video premiered on March 16, 2011, on music video website Vevo. It opens with the translator voice tells the caption \"This video was filmed in Japan one week before the earthquake and tsunami. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the people of Japan. We love you.\" It was shot in a guerrilla-style. Fergie is seen in a hotel room, will.i.am is in the back of a car.

The song was released on May 21, 2009, and debuted at number two on the Canadian and Billboard Hot 100, behind the group's previous single \"Boom Boom Pow\", making the group one of 11 artists who have occupied the top two positions of the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. It reached number one on the US charts and 20 charts worldwide.\nThe song was nominated for Record of the Year at the 52nd Grammy Awards and won the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. \"I Gotta Feeling\" ranked fifth on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. The song was also nominated as Song of the Year at the 2009 World Music Awards. In March 2011, it became the first song in digital history to sell over 7 million digital copies in the United States. As of June 2019, \"I Gotta Feeling\" had over 9 million downloads in the country, and held the record as the most downloaded song on iTunes of all time. This also makes it the highest selling digital as well as non-charity single in the US ever.\n\"I Gotta Feeling\" spent 14 consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, making it the longest-running number-one single of 2009. The song was the third most successful song of the decade in Australia, as announced on January 7, 2010.\n\"I Gotta Feeling\" was written and composed by all the members of The Black Eyed Peas (credited as William Adams, Allan Pineda, Jaime Gomez, and Stacy Ferguson) together with French producers David Guetta, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer (a.k.a. Fred Rister ), both of whom produced the song. Adams provided additional synthesizer work to the song. The song was recorded at Square Prod in Paris, France and Metropolis Studios in London, England, United Kingdom. \"I Gotta Feeling\" is the second single released from The E.N.D (2009). Interscope Records serviced the song to contemporary hit and rhythmic crossover radios on June 23, 2009, in the United States. In an interview with Annie Reuter of Marie Claire, will.i.am stated that \"It's dedicated to all the party people out there in the world that want to go out and party. Mostly every song on the Black Eyed Peas record is painting a picture of our party life. It was a conscious decision to make this type of record. Times are really hard for a lot of people and you want to give them escape and you want to make them feel good about life, especially at these low points.\"\nThe song is an uptempo dance-pop song that runs a length of four minutes and 49 seconds. It follows in the inspirational dance-pop theme of The E.N.D, being built upon the heavy use of Auto-Tune and futuristic synthesizers while running through a tick-tock rhythm. It is composed in the key of G major. The song begins in a restrained fashion then moves into a throbbing dance beat that changes patterns so that at least one reviewer thought it shifted tempos, although in fact the tempo does not change at all, suggesting the use of a click track in recording. It contains electronic influences. The song samples a beat from the song \"Take a Dive\" by Bryan Pringle. The \"woo-hoo\" line is sampled from The Police's song \"Every Breath You Take\". Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times noted the song's similarities to Five Stairsteps' song \"Ooh Child\", writing that it emulates the song's \"use of a repetitive, warm vocal line to signify a good mood coming on.\" According to Jimmy Iovine of the Interscope Geffen A&M label group, the melody was inspired by the U2 song \"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\": \"I sent will.i.am over to the studio to do some remixes on I'll Go Crazy. He works on them for two weeks, comes back and writes I Gotta Feeling. The chords are U2 chords, 100 per cent. Will even told them.\"\n\"I Gotta Feeling\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. David Balls, a writer for Digital Spy, gave the song a four-star rating, writing that the song is \"every bit as quirky as its predecessor (\"Boom Boom Pow\")\". However, he compared it to Girls Aloud's \"Biology\", writing that they sound like a collection of musical ideas \"that only makes sense after a few listens.\" Another writer for Digital Spy, Nick Levine, praised \"I Gotta Feeling\" and \"Rock That Body\" as ace collaborations with French disc jockey David Guetta.

The song was written by members will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo and Fergie, along with Joshua Alvarez, Stephen Shadowen, Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, and Julie Frost, for the group's sixth studio album, The Beginning (2010). It was announced on January 21, 2011, as the album's second single.\nThe song has been a success on the charts, reaching the top-five in many countries, such as New Zealand (their twelfth top 5),  Australia, Greece, France, United Kingdom and the United States, among others. The video for this song was filmed in Japan a week before the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami happened.\nAs of June 2011, the single has sold more than 2,462,000 digital units in the US.\nThe Beginning's second single was announced on The Black Eyed Peas' official website on January 21, 2011.\nRodney Jerkins and Julie Frost composed the basic song together, with Jerkins on piano and Frost contributing the lyrics and topline melody.

It was shot over a three-day period in Tokyo, Japan primarily in the Ginza and Shibuya districts while the group was on a press tour. The opening clips show shots of the Ginza district. The video was shot between 3\u20135 March 2011, just one week before the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Fergie spoke of the clip and the natural disaster in Japan, saying, \"It was the easiest video I ever shot because it was us living our lives. I love that it's showing a true perspective of how it can sometimes be lonely on the road away from our loved ones. It also demonstrates the love and connection we have with Japan. Our heart goes out to all of the Japanese people who have been affected by this natural disaster.\" Taboo was also quoted saying \"It was an amazing moment in time because Japan has always been my favorite place on the planet. It was great to do our video there. God bless the Japanese. Our love goes out to them.\"\nThe video premiered on March 16, 2011, on music video website Vevo. It opens with the translator voice tells the caption \"This video was filmed in Japan one week before the earthquake and tsunami. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the people of Japan. We love you.\" It was shot in a guerrilla-style. Fergie is seen in a hotel room, will.i.am is in the back of a car.

She co-wrote the song with Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and  Ali Payami. Capitol Records first released it on July 14, 2016, as a standalone single, and Katy Perry\u2019s first single in almost two years. \"Rise\" is a mid-tempo electronic song with lyrical themes of victory and rising above one's opponents. After an Olympics-themed promotional video was released the following day, an official music video debuted on August 4, 2016.\nCommercially, the song reached number one in Australia, the top ten in the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Scotland, and Spain, the top twenty in Argentina, Canada, Lebanon, Switzerland, and the United States, and the top thirty in Austria, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\nNBC Sports announced upon the release of \"Rise\" that it would be prominently featured during its US television coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics. Perry stated that the track is \"a song that's brewing inside me for years, that has finally come to the surface\", and wanted to release it as a standalone track instead of including it on an album \"because now more than ever, there is a need for our world to unite\". Half of the song had previously been written prior to the Olympics, but was not completed because she felt \"it didn't come out right\". Perry further added:\nI can't think of a better example than the Olympic athletes, as they gather in Rio with their strength and fearlessness, to remind us how we ALL can come together, with the resolve to be the best we can be. I hope this song can inspire us to heal, unite, and rise together. I am honored that NBC Olympics has chosen to use ['Rise'] as an anthem before and during the Rio Games.\nNBC felt its message spoke \"directly to the spirit of the Olympics and its athletes\" for its inspirational themes. It was released as a single on July 14, 2016, for streaming on Apple Music and for download on iTunes.\nPerry co-wrote \"Rise\" with Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and  Ali Payami. It is a mid-tempo electronic song about victory and rising above opponents. Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic wrote the song is \"a languid anthem of determination that uses an echo machine and aggressive use of metaphor to evoke icons as diverse as Katniss Everdeen, Maya Angelou, and Jesus.\" BenI Ratliff of The New York Times called it a \"slow-footed\" song. In a review for Entertainment Weekly, Kevin O'Donell noted that the song \"starts with brooding atmospherics and minor-key synths before exploding into a huge chorus\".\nThe song is three minutes and twenty-three seconds long. It is written in the key of E\u266d minor with a common time tempo of 101.5 beats per minute. Perry's vocals span from C\u266f\u2084 to E\u266d\u2085 in the song.\nDaniel Kreps of Rolling Stone described the song as \"a galvanic sequel\" to \"Roar\". Marissa Payne from The Washington Post wrote: \"Sure, it's a bit of a slow jam, but the uplifting lyrics to 'Rise' are pretty solid.\" The song received a mixed response from The New York Times's journalists Jon Pareles, Ben Ratliff and Jon Caramanica who deemed the song \"limp\", writing they feel \"psyched\" and \"uneasy\". It received an average score of 5.7/10 from Idolator's critics. Kevin O'Donell of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a B+.\nChris Ingalls from Pop Matters described the song's nature as an \"emotional delivery\", and felt it worked nicely for the Olympics. Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent deemed it as \"power anthem mode\".\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Rise\" became Perry's 20th entry in the UK Singles Chart top 75, when it debuted and peaked at number 25 on the chart dated 22 July 2016, with first week sales of 22,497 copies. It became the 1055th number-one song in Australia, and the second song to debut atop the ARIA Singles Chart in 2016 following \"Pillowtalk\" by Zayn Malik. Perry's accumulated weeks at number-one atop the chart equaled to fourteen, placing her at fifth position on the list of artist with most number-ones in the 2010s. It also became her fourth number-one in the nation after \"I Kissed a Girl\", \"California Gurls\", and \"Roar\", and was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association for shipments of 35,000 units.\nIn the United States, \"Rise\" debuted and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, for the chart of August 6, 2016. It became Perry's 24th Hot 100 entry and her third-highest debut at the time behind \"Part of Me\" (number one) and \"California Gurls\" featuring Snoop Dogg (number two). It is also her first entry on the Hot 100 since 2014's \"This Is How We Do\"."

The song serves as the fifth international single from the album, and was released in Australia on January 29, 2010, in the United Kingdom on March 15 and in the United States on May 11. The song peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming the fifth top ten hit from the album.\nCo-produced by French DJ/producer David Guetta, the song heavily samples from Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's \"It Takes Two\", making use of the line \"I wanna rock right now\" multiple times, as well as the drum break, and part of the \"Yeah! Woo!\" line. The Black Eyed Peas use Auto-Tune throughout the song, and Fergie's voice has been notably high-pitched. Spin described \"Rock That Body\" as \"trance-y\". The song is most known to critics as a robotic party track on the album. The song has been compared to be stylistically similar to Flo Rida, whose song \"Club Can't Handle Me\" (from the motion picture Step Up 3D) Guetta would later go on to produce.\nFraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog gave \"Rock That Body\" three out of five stars and called it \"a party banger\". \"Rock That Body\" was well-reviewed by Mike Schiller of PopMatters. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating: \"It's got plenty of pounding beats, synths that sound like they've been filled with Red Bull and more twisted vocal effects than an mp3 of Akon cutting loose in a vocoder factory. It's pretty simple stuff and it will no doubt grate something rotten on the 36th listen...\"\nThe song was a success, reaching the top ten in many countries and top twenty in a number of others, too. \nOn the US Billboard Hot 100, the song peaked at number nine, making it their fifth consecutive top ten hit. For airplay, it proved to be their lowest-charting song since non-single \"Gone Going\" from their fourth studio album Monkey Business (2005), released to radio stations in early 2006.\nThe video was filmed on January 13, 2010, at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California. Directed by Rich Lee, it was shot back to back with the video for \"Imma Be\", the fourth song on The E.N.D. The two songs were mashed up into a medley, which is titled \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\". The medley length is 8:15 and the music video in total is 10:21. It premiered on Vevo and Dipdive on Tuesday, February 16, 2010. The videos were separated for music channels with the introduction and conclusion removed. The video is described as a futuristic Wizard of Oz. It is the sequel for the \"Imma Be\" video and the second half of the \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\" video. It begins with the Black Eyed Peas and their good robot arriving at a city, the people in the city are stuck in a glitch. The 4 members of the group shoot them with their stereo-guns to end their loop so they could continue dancing. As things are going well, the bad robot appears and kidnaps Fergie, will.i.am chases after it with his own robot while Fergie fights the bad robot and the other two members free the remaining people. After many failed attempts, will.i.am manages to shoot the bad robot, which starts dancing with the good robot. The video ends as the bad robot runs out of energy and faints. The \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\" video closes with a scene which reveals the entire story to be Fergie's dream as the other members find her barely conscious following her motorcycle accident in the introduction. As they check to see if she is okay, Fergie excitedly begins to tell them of her idea for their next music video.\nUK CD Single\nDigital Download E.P.\nSongwriting - will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, Fergie, David Guetta, Mark Knight, Adam Walder, Jean Baptiste, Jamie Munson, Robert Ginyard\nVocals - will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, Fergie\nProduction - David Guetta, will.i.am, Mark Knight, Funkagenda\nKeyboards - Mark Night, Adam Walder, will.i.am\nGuitar, additional keyboards, additional vocals - Hal Ritson\nArrangement - will.i.am\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n\nList of number-one dance hits of 2010 (UK)\nFMQB: Radio Industry News, Music Industry Updates, Arbitron Ratings, Music News and more!\n[14339,93949]\nGill, Andy (June 12, 2009). \"Album: The Black Eyed Peas, The E.N.D.

It reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming a defining track of the Britpop movement as well as Pulp's signature song in the process. In 2014, BBC Radio 6 Music listeners voted it their favourite Britpop song in an online poll. In a 2015 Rolling Stone readers' poll it was voted the greatest Britpop song.\nThe song is a critique on those who were perceived as wanting to be \"like common people\" and who ascribe glamour to poverty. This phenomenon is referred to as slumming or \"class tourism\". The song was written by the band members Jarvis Cocker, Nick Banks, Candida Doyle, Steve Mackey and Russell Senior. Cocker had conceived the song after meeting a Greek art student while studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London (the college and the student feature in the lyrics). He came up with the tune on a Casiotone keyboard he had bought in a music store in Notting Hill, west London.\nJustin Myers of the Official Charts Company wrote, '\"Common People\" was typical Pulp \u2013 a biting satire of posh people \u2018roughing it\u2019 and acting like tourists by hanging with the \"common people\". Jarvis delivered his scathing putdown with glee, in an iconic music video featuring actress Sadie Frost as the posho on the receiving end of Jarvis' acid tongue.' Pulp first performed the song in public during the band's set at the Reading Festival in August 1994. A year later they performed it at Glastonbury Festival as the headline act. The song has since been covered by various artists. In 2004, a Ben Folds-produced cover version by William Shatner brought \"Common People\" to new audiences outside Europe.\nThe idea for the song's lyrics came from a Greek art student whom Pulp singer-songwriter Jarvis Cocker met while he was studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Cocker had enrolled in a film studies course at the college in September 1988 while taking a break from Pulp. He spoke about the song's inspiration in NME in 2013:\nI'd met the girl from the song many years before, when I was at St Martin's College. I'd met her on a sculpture course, but at St Martin's you had a thing called Crossover Fortnight, where you had to do another discipline for a couple of weeks. I was studying film, and she might've been doing painting, but we both decided to do sculpture for two weeks. I don't know her name. It would've been around 1988, so it was already ancient history when I wrote about her.\nIn a 2012 question-and-answer session on BBC Radio 5 Live Cocker said that he was having a conversation with the girl at the bar at college because he was attracted to her, although he found some aspects of her personality unpleasant. He remembered that at one point she had told him she \"wanted to move to Hackney and live like 'the common people'\u2009\". Cocker used this phrase as the starting point for the song and embellished the situation for dramatic effect, for example reversing the situation in the song when the female character declares that \"I want to sleep with common people like you\" (Cocker said that in real life he had been the one wanting to sleep with the girl, while she had not been interested in him). Taking this inspiration, the narrator explains that his female acquaintance can \"never be like common people\", because even if she gets a flat where \"roaches climb the wall\" ultimately, \"if [she] called [her] dad he could stop it all\", in contrast to the true common people who can only \"watch [their] lives slide out of view\".\nA BBC Three documentary failed to locate the woman, who, Cocker stated, could have been in any fine art course but that \"sculpture\" sounded better. The lyrics were in part a response by Cocker, who usually focused on the introspective and emotional aspects of pop, to more politically minded members of the band like Russell Senior. Furthermore, Cocker felt that 'slumming' was becoming a dominant theme in popular culture and this contributed to the single's rushed release. Cocker said \"it seemed to be in the air, that kind of patronising social voyeurism... I felt that of Parklife, for example, or Natural Born Killers \u2013 there is that noble savage notion. But if you walk round a council estate, there's plenty of savagery and not much nobility going on.\"\nIn May 2015, Greek newspaper Athens Voice"

Keys co-wrote and co-produced the R&B ballad with Jeff Bhasker and Salaam Remi. The song contains an interpolation of the drums from the 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" by American rock guitarist Billy Squier, who received a writing credit on \"Girl on Fire\". Released on September 4, 2012, as the lead single from the album of the same name, \"Girl on Fire\" is Keys' first release under RCA Records following the closure of J Records, after a reorganization at Sony Music Entertainment.\n\"Girl on Fire\" was inspired by Keys' giving birth to her son Egypt and marriage to husband Swizz Beatz. Keys recorded a three-track suite for the song, consisting of the main version in addition to two remixes. The first remix, titled \"Inferno\", adds two new verses from American hip hop artist Nicki Minaj, whilst the second mix titled \"Bluelight\" strips back the drums and piano leaving a sparse bass-led production and re-recorded \"smokey\" vocals. \"Girl on Fire\" opened to extremely positive reviews from critics, with many praising Keys' vocals and the song's production. Keys performed \"Girl on Fire\" for the first time at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards on September 6, 2012, where she was joined by Minaj and American gymnastics gold-medalist Gabby Douglas. The song has been certified 5x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\"Girl on Fire\" is the lead single and title track from Alicia Keys' fifth studio album, Girl on Fire (2012). Alongside the main single, Keys recorded two other versions: the Inferno Remix which features new verses from Nicki Minaj and a Bluelight Remix which strips back the vocals and production from the main single. Gerrick Kennedy from the LA Times spoke of the multiple versions of the song commenting that the main single was most likely made for pop radio, but noted that Minaj's verses on the Inferno Remix would probably get noticed more. On being able to premiere her new song at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, Keys said, \nDebuting a new song at the VMAs is definitely special. I debuted 'No One' at the VMAs\u00a0\u2014 it was the first time anyone in the world heard 'No One,' Keys said. \"It's the perfect setting. It's the right energy. It's the right vibe. People are so excited about the night of music and hearing different styles that it just goes over really well. I can't wait!\n\n\"Girl on Fire\" is a midtempo song written by Keys, Jeff Bhasker, Salaam Remi and American rock guitarist Billy Squier. Squier earns a writing credit for the inclusion of an interpolation of the drums from his 1980 song \"The Big Beat\". Composed on the key of A major, \"Girl on Fire\" uses common time and is set to a \"heavy beat\" at a tempo of 93 beats per minute. Keys' vocals range in the song over an octave from a low note of C\u266f\u2084 up to a high note of E\u2085. On the main single, Keys opens the songs with the lyrics \"She got both feet on the ground and she's burning it down. She got her head in the clouds and she's not backing down. This girl is on fire!\" Keys' lyrics centre around toasting the \"achievements of women everywhere\", particularly with the hook \"She's just a girl and she's on fire\", which according to MTV's Rob Markman is delivered with a \"calming-yet-commanding wail\". Markman also spoke of the pace of the song, describing it as \"pulsating\". LA Time's Gerrick Kennedy expanded further describing the songs components as \"a fierce battlecry over a fast-building simplistic hook\". Critics likened \"Girl on Fire\" to Keys' previous singles \"No One\" (2007) and \"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\" (2009). Throwing \"If I Ain't Got You\" (2004) into the list of comparisons, Erin Thompson from Seattle Weekly said \"Girl on Fire\" compares to previous Keys' ballads with its \"quiet, unassuming verses leading into big, empathic choruses.\"\nThe Inferno version features Nicki Minaj, who wrote and rapped two new verses on the song. Minaj's vocals were recorded at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. The inferno remix uses the same production and sample as the main single however, the first two verses of the song were described as \"understated\" by Carl Williot from Idolator, with Minaj leading the remix with a new rap verse. She raps \"Took me on the balcony, telling me to jump with her/ Yeah I'm in the ghost but I ain't doing stunts with her/ I ain't trying to be that, haters want to see"

It was written by Twain along with her then husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, and produced by Lange. It was released on September 23, 1997 by Mercury Records Nashville as the lead single from Twain's third studio album Come On Over (1997). It was chosen as such following weeks of careful deliberation and constant reconsidering. Originally titled \"'Gol Darn Gone and Done It\", the song's title was altered because of its difficulty to pronounce.  The song regards falling in love despite numerous attempts to evade it. It is an uptempo number that prominently features fiddle. The single was later included on Twain's album Greatest Hits (2004).\nCritics favored \"Love Gets Me Every Time\"'s immaculate production. The song became a success in country radio. It topped Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart for five consecutive weeks, Twain's fifth and longest reign on the chart. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over 500,000 copies in the United States. \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" was also her seventh number-one country hit in Canada. Its music video was directed by photographer Timothy White during the photo shoot for Come On Over's album art. It features Twain in various performance scenes, along with behind-the-scenes shots. Furthermore, the song has become a staple on Twain's set lists, as it was performed live on the Come On Over, Up! and Rock This Country tours, as well as the Let's Go! residency in Las Vegas. In addition, the song was performed in an acoustic version on the Still the One residency.\n\"Love Gets Me Every Time\" was written by Twain and her then husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, and produced solely by Lange. Twain developed the song at first and brought it to Lange under the title \"'Gol Darn Gone and Done It\", which derived from a country expression Twain had heard of. The name made Lange burst in laughter when he first heard it, and the couple completed the song together. However, executives at Mercury Records Nashville were concerned that radio DJs would mispronounce the title's tongue twisting words when announcing the single. Twain concurred, and renamed it \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" instead. The track was chosen as the lead single for Come On Over after a few weeks of careful deliberation. Twain told CMT Totally in 1997, \"We had such a hard time choosing this first single. I don't know. We just ended up there. We went around in circles for weeks until we finally decided on that single. It really just felt right, and I really can't describe it any better than that. I think it's just one of those things where we had the chance to live with the options for a few weeks and everyone just ended up there. So, it just felt right. I guess we went with our gut on that one.\" A CD single, 7\" vinyl single and a cassette single were released simultaneously on September 23, 1997 in the US and Canada, featuring three versions of \"Love Gets Me Every Time\". A second CD single and vinyl single with a dance mix of the song was released on the same day. The song was later included on Twain's Greatest Hits (2004) compilation.\nReviews from critics were generally favorable. Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly believed \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" followed the successful formula of her past hits, including rich and smooth vocals and infectious superstructure. Deborah Evans Price of Billboard picked the single as having the most potential, predicting it would \"rocket up the charts\" given that Lange and Twain followed formula they created for Twain's previous album The Woman in Me (1995). Furthermore, she stated, \"The lyric is lightweight, the performance is pretty much a matter of individual taste, and, as usual, the production is the real star here.\" Matt Bjorke of About.com listed the song amongst the pros of Come On Over. While reviewing Greatest Hits, Nick Reynolds of BBC called the track \"infectiously cheerful\", and spoke of it when explaining how Twain and Lange \"raise[d] their game\" on Come On Over. \"Love Gets Me Everytime\" was awarded a BMI Country Award at the 1998 ceremony.\n\"Love Gets Me Every Time\" peaked at number four the Canadian Singles Chart, a now-defunct chart which only tracked physical single sales, and was compiled by Nielsen SoundScan and published by Jam!. \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" debuted at number 67 on RPM's airplay-measuring Canadian Country Singles chart on the week of September 22, 1997.

It was released as the third single from her third studio album Come On Over (1997). The song was written by Twain and Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange and produced by Lange. It was released in the US on January 27, 1998, and was Twain's first single to be released to pop radio.\n\"You're Still the One\" peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks, becoming Twain's first top-ten hit in the US. Although it never topped the chart, the song is recognized as Twain's most successful crossover single and is one of her most successful singles at country radio. In Canada, the song peaked at number seven, and internationally, it reached number one in Australia for four weeks, number three in Ireland, and the top 10 in the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\"You're Still the One\" was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 1999, winning two. It won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance and lost Record of the Year and Song of the Year to fellow Canadian, Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\". It was ranked number 46 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s.\nWhen Shania Twain and Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange became romantically involved in the mid 1990s, there was criticism of their relationship, namely claims that the age difference was extreme, and that Twain was solely using him to further her career. In essence, the critics did not expect their relationship to last. Twain disagreed with these criticisms and wanted to address them in public and this led to her writing \"You're Still the One\". In an interview with Top of the Pops in 1999, she mentioned that she and Lange never intended to write a song about themselves, but that they were simply influenced by the press criticism. \nIn her 2011 memoir From This Moment On, she described the process of writing the song: she and Lange each wrote separate ideas for songs for the album Come on Over and collated them together later. She stated that Lange singing the counter line as backing vocals in the song got her \"feeling very excited\" and led her to sing the chorus melody and both to come up with the title \"You're Still the One\". In this ode to the union between her and Lange, Twain expresses her happiness with their relationship, and satisfaction with proving the critics wrong. \nTwain and Lange divorced twelve years later in 2010 after 17 years of marriage, due to an affair between Lange and her best friend. In her biography, Twain states that she continues to cherish the song in memory of her mother and of her stepfather. She believes that they were meant to be together and that, in spite of all the trials they have been through, her parents shared a very pure and true love.\nAccording to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Songs of Polygram International, Inc., the song is written in the key of E\u266d major following a chord progression of E\u266d\u00a0\u2013 E\u266d/G\u00a0\u2013 A\u266d\u00a0\u2013 B\u266d, and Twain's vocals span from G\u2083 to B\u266d\u2084. The song moves at a tempo of 67 beats per minute.\nBlender ranked \"You're Still the One\" at number 69 in their list of Greatest Songs Since You Were Born. Dave Fawbert from ShortList described it as a \"gorgeous song, with a timeless melody and kind of an unusual topic for a sad-sounding love song\". Stacker placed the song at number 17 in their list of Best 90s pop songs in 2019. VH1 ranked it at number 46 in their list of 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s.\nThe music video for \"You're Still the One\" was shot in Malibu and Los Angeles completely in black and white and was directed by David Hogan. It was released on January 26, 1998 on CMT.\nIt depicts Twain on a beach at night and features model John Devoe, who later appeared in her video for \"That Don't Impress Me Much\". The video received heavy rotation, it was Twain's first video to be played on non-country-specific stations such as MTV, VH1, and MuchMusic. The video won awards at the Billboard Music Video Awards, VH1 Viewer's Choice Awards, and was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award. Two versions of the video were made, one with the 'Original Album Version', released to country channels, and the 'International Version' released to pop and international stations. The 'International Version' of the video is available on Twain's compilations Come On Over: Video Collection"

It was written by Fergie and Toby Gad while the production was helmed by will.i.am. The song was released as the fourth single from the album on May 22, 2007. \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" deviates from the hip hop and urban music of Fergie's previous singles and opts for a more simplistic pop ballad sound that incorporates acoustic elements. It features credits from about thirty instrumentalists, many of which play the violins, violas and celli on the track. Lyrically, the song talks about moving on from the pain of a breakup.\nThe critical reception of \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" was positive, with many praising the maturity and simplicity displayed on the single as well as the message.

Bill Lamb of About.com rated the song four out of five stars, praising the mood, lyrics and vocals as \"mellow, still sexy\", \"intelligent\" and \"strong\".

It was written by Twain along with her then husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, and produced by Lange. It was released on September 23, 1997 by Mercury Records Nashville as the lead single from Twain's third studio album Come On Over (1997). It was chosen as such following weeks of careful deliberation and constant reconsidering. Originally titled \"'Gol Darn Gone and Done It\", the song's title was altered because of its difficulty to pronounce.  The song regards falling in love despite numerous attempts to evade it. It is an uptempo number that prominently features fiddle. The single was later included on Twain's album Greatest Hits (2004).\nCritics favored \"Love Gets Me Every Time\"'s immaculate production. The song became a success in country radio. It topped Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart for five consecutive weeks, Twain's fifth and longest reign on the chart. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over 500,000 copies in the United States. \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" was also her seventh number-one country hit in Canada. Its music video was directed by photographer Timothy White during the photo shoot for Come On Over's album art. It features Twain in various performance scenes, along with behind-the-scenes shots. Furthermore, the song has become a staple on Twain's set lists, as it was performed live on the Come On Over, Up! and Rock This Country tours, as well as the Let's Go! residency in Las Vegas. In addition, the song was performed in an acoustic version on the Still the One residency.\n\"Love Gets Me Every Time\" was written by Twain and her then husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, and produced solely by Lange. Twain developed the song at first and brought it to Lange under the title \"'Gol Darn Gone and Done It\", which derived from a country expression Twain had heard of. The name made Lange burst in laughter when he first heard it, and the couple completed the song together. However, executives at Mercury Records Nashville were concerned that radio DJs would mispronounce the title's tongue twisting words when announcing the single. Twain concurred, and renamed it \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" instead. The track was chosen as the lead single for Come On Over after a few weeks of careful deliberation. Twain told CMT Totally in 1997, \"We had such a hard time choosing this first single. I don't know. We just ended up there. We went around in circles for weeks until we finally decided on that single. It really just felt right, and I really can't describe it any better than that. I think it's just one of those things where we had the chance to live with the options for a few weeks and everyone just ended up there. So, it just felt right. I guess we went with our gut on that one.\" A CD single, 7\" vinyl single and a cassette single were released simultaneously on September 23, 1997 in the US and Canada, featuring three versions of \"Love Gets Me Every Time\". A second CD single and vinyl single with a dance mix of the song was released on the same day. The song was later included on Twain's Greatest Hits (2004) compilation.\nReviews from critics were generally favorable. Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly believed \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" followed the successful formula of her past hits, including rich and smooth vocals and infectious superstructure. Deborah Evans Price of Billboard picked the single as having the most potential, predicting it would \"rocket up the charts\" given that Lange and Twain followed formula they created for Twain's previous album The Woman in Me (1995). Furthermore, she stated, \"The lyric is lightweight, the performance is pretty much a matter of individual taste, and, as usual, the production is the real star here.\" Matt Bjorke of About.com listed the song amongst the pros of Come On Over. While reviewing Greatest Hits, Nick Reynolds of BBC called the track \"infectiously cheerful\", and spoke of it when explaining how Twain and Lange \"raise[d] their game\" on Come On Over. \"Love Gets Me Everytime\" was awarded a BMI Country Award at the 1998 ceremony.\n\"Love Gets Me Every Time\" peaked at number four the Canadian Singles Chart, a now-defunct chart which only tracked physical single sales, and was compiled by Nielsen SoundScan and published by Jam!. \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" debuted at number 67 on RPM's airplay-measuring Canadian Country Singles chart on the week of September 22, 1997.

(2002). The song was written by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange and Twain. The single was released in the United States radio on April 7, 2003. The video debuted on Country Music Television on April 26, 2003. The song was also used for Febreze: Scentstories promotion, in which Twain took part. In 2006, \"Forever and for Always\" was certified gold for 500,000 digital downloads in the U.S. by the RIAA.\n\"Forever and for Always\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2004, Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance; however, it lost in both categories. The song was also named Song of the Year at both the 2004 BMI Country Songwriter Awards and 2004 European BMI Awards (validated only for Shania Twain's shares, Mutt's shares are ASCAP-controlled).\nTwain said there is something inspirational to her about people who start relationships when they are kids, and are still in love when they are older. Twain really enjoyed doing the video for the song, because she was able to realize that visually. She said it is one of her favorite songs.\n\"Forever and for Always\" is performed in the key of G\u266d major in  time following a chord progression of G\u266d\u2013G\u266d2\u2013C\u266d\u2013D\u266d, and Twain's vocals span from G\u266d\u2083 to E\u266d\u2085.

It was directed by Paul Boyd, who shot her \"When You Kiss Me\" video around the same time also in New Zealand. It debuted on Country Music Television (CMT) on April 26, 2003. The video shows two children at the beach together, then it shows them as teens, and eventually seniors, visualizing the theme of the song of staying together forever. Scenes of Twain at the beach are intercut throughout the video. The video was released with both the 'red' and 'green' versions, with each also having an 'all performance' video of only Twain at the beach. The video released a 'blue' version internationally as well. The video won the Female Video of the Year Award at the 2004 CMT Flameworthy Awards, and was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2003 Canadian Country Music Awards, but lost to another song by Twain, \"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!\". The video is available on select singles, and the DVD-Audio version of Up!.\nBillboard magazine contrasted the song against the previous two singles saying it \"relies less on cutesy gimmicks (and exclamation marks) and focuses thematically on steadfast love\", while comparing it to Shania's earlier singles \"From This Moment On\" and \"You're Still the One\". About.com ranked the song 95th for the top 100 pop songs of 2003.\n\"Forever and for Always\" debuted on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart the week of April 12, 2003, at number 60.

It was written by Underwood, Hillary Lindsey, and David Hodges. It was released as the fourth and final single from Underwood's fourth studio album, Blown Away, on April 15, 2013. Underwood announced the single on her official Twitter account.\nUnderwood debuted the song on the twelfth season of American Idol on April 4, 2013. \"See You Again\" is Underwood's eighteenth consecutive Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and is also her seventeenth single to be certified at least Gold by the RIAA. As of December 2013, the single has sold 740,000 copies in the United States. On August 10, 2015, \"See You Again\" was officially certified as Platinum.\n\"See You Again\" tells the story of moving onwards after experiencing the death of a loved one in life. The lyrics provide hope and promise through Underwood's belief that one will reunite with every fallen loved one in the afterlife. The song's opening consists of a solo piano, followed by a backing chorus and band kicking in shortly after.\n\"See You Again\" was originally one of three songs written for the 2010 feature film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Of the three songs that Underwood, Hodges, and Lindsey co-wrote for the film, the workers behind the project opted to choose \"There's a Place For Us.\" Underwood pushed to include \"See You Again\" on her fourth studio album, Blown Away, during the writing process of the album.\nSee You Again is written in the key of A-flat major, with a vocal range from F3 to D\u266d5.\nThe song has received positive reviews from music critics. Billboard.com described the song to be \"truly a taste of heaven.\" Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe included the song in his personal favorite tracks from the Blown Away studio album in the website's 2012 year-end countdown of editors' favorite Country albums of the year, as did Matt Bjorke of Roughstock for their album countdown. Liv Carter of Urban Country News gave the song a \"thumbs up\", adding \"what pulls it over the line however, and presumably why it has become a fan-favorite, is its sincerity in wishing to bring comfort and Underwood\u2019s confident performance.\" Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was less favorable, saying that \"the chorus of power ballad \"See You Again\" is marred by dated, campy arena-rock clich\u00e9s.\"\nThe song debuted at No. 60 on the US Country Airplay chart for the week of April 13, 2013, and peaked at No. 2 for the chart dated September 7, 2013.  It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 90 for the chart dated May 18, 2013, and peaked at No. 34 for the chart of August 31, 2013.  It also peaked at No.7 on the Hot Country Songs chart on August 24, 2013.  As of December 2013, the single has sold 740,000 copies in the United States.\nOn August 10, 2015 \"See You Again\" was officially certified as Platinum.\n\n\n\nOn June 7, 2013, Good Morning America gave a first look for the music video for \"See You Again\". The full video premiered soon after on ABCNews.com. The music video was directed by Eric Welch.

It is the third single from Underwood's second studio album, Carnival Ride. It was released in the United States on April 7, 2008, by which point the song had already charted. At the 51st Grammy Awards, the song won Underwood her third consecutive Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. It has sold 1,300,000 copies to date.\nThe song is one of four tracks on the album co-written by Underwood, and the third consecutive one to be released as a single from the album.\nThe song is a moderate up-tempo describing a woman meeting a man at a club and later eloping with him in Las Vegas after having had too much to drink that night. She wakes up the next morning, \"thinkin' 'bout Elvis somewhere in Vegas\", to discover that she does not even know her last name (i.e., she married the man while she was intoxicated), and worries that her \"mama would be so ashamed.\" The music video portrays the song as a prequel to her \"Before He Cheats\" song, even going so far as to hire the same actor to play the man in question.\nThe single was generally met with mixed reviews.\nAllmusic picked the song as a \"track pick\", calling the song \"Miranda Lambert filtered through Shania Twain\", and dubbed it a \"one night stand anthem.\" Rolling Stone picked the track as their favorite, saying \"the most fun is \"Last Name,\" where she gets wasted and runs off to Vegas with a guy she doesn't know.\" Blender awarded the song four out of five stars, describing the song as the \"most irresponsible (and fun) moment on the new album involves one wild night, one too many shots of Cuervo and one unexpected ring.\" Billboard gave a positive review of the track, praising the lyrics: \"It's a cleverly penned lyric that hilariously celebrates drunken debauchery\" as well as summing it up as \"a performance that combines soulful vocals, edgy intensity and sassy attitude into a delicious cocktail.\"\nHowever, it also received some negative reviews: Engine 145 gave the song a 'thumbs down', describing the song as a \"straight-laced performance\" that just \"places the focus on the vocal\". Slant Magazine labelled the single as a \"bald-faced attempt at recreating the 'Before He Cheats' phenomenon\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwood performed the song live for the first time on television during the 43rd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards on May 18, 2008. She performed the song live at the seventh season finale of American Idol on May 21, 2008. She performed the song at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009.\nThe song is described in the video as what happened before the \"Before He Cheats\" video.\nThe video starts with some segments from \"Before He Cheats\" and then goes into a scene three months earlier (\"before he cheated\", it says) with her in the club drinking with her friends. The same man from the \"Before He Cheats\" spots her and asks her for a dance. From this point on, while the guy is with Underwood, he is flirting with every other woman he sees. After the dance, Underwood leaves with the guy in his car with fuzzy dice in the rear view mirror. They make it out to Las Vegas where they participate in a couple of gambling activities such as roulette and a Wheel of Fortune game where they win a new truck. Later they get married in a chapel with an Elvis impersonator officiating. They run off in his new pickup truck (the one used in \"Before He Cheats\") and the video ends with a spark from the chapel sign lights.\nThe song debuted at number 46 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, nearly a month before the single's official release. For the week of June 21, 2008 it rose from number five to number one, to become her fifth straight number one on the Billboard chart, her seventh straight number one country single, and her eighth number one Billboard single overall. This marked Underwood as the first solo female artist to have five consecutive number one's on the country survey in almost 20 years, since Rosanne Cash had a string of six number one titles between 1987 and 1989. It is the third country number one from Carnival Ride and reached the top of the chart faster than the first two singles, taking only 13 weeks. \"Last Name\" has sold 1,300,000 downloads as of November 2015.\nOn the Hot 100 the song reached number 19, making it Underwood's fifth top 20 Hot 100 hit, and the second from Carnival Ride.\n\n\n\nKristin Chenoweth performed a cover of the song"

It was written by Underwood, Hillary Lindsey, and David Hodges. It was released as the fourth and final single from Underwood's fourth studio album, Blown Away, on April 15, 2013. Underwood announced the single on her official Twitter account.\nUnderwood debuted the song on the twelfth season of American Idol on April 4, 2013. \"See You Again\" is Underwood's eighteenth consecutive Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and is also her seventeenth single to be certified at least Gold by the RIAA. As of December 2013, the single has sold 740,000 copies in the United States. On August 10, 2015, \"See You Again\" was officially certified as Platinum.\n\"See You Again\" tells the story of moving onwards after experiencing the death of a loved one in life. The lyrics provide hope and promise through Underwood's belief that one will reunite with every fallen loved one in the afterlife. The song's opening consists of a solo piano, followed by a backing chorus and band kicking in shortly after.\n\"See You Again\" was originally one of three songs written for the 2010 feature film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Of the three songs that Underwood, Hodges, and Lindsey co-wrote for the film, the workers behind the project opted to choose \"There's a Place For Us.\" Underwood pushed to include \"See You Again\" on her fourth studio album, Blown Away, during the writing process of the album.\nSee You Again is written in the key of A-flat major, with a vocal range from F3 to D\u266d5.\nThe song has received positive reviews from music critics. Billboard.com described the song to be \"truly a taste of heaven.\" Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe included the song in his personal favorite tracks from the Blown Away studio album in the website's 2012 year-end countdown of editors' favorite Country albums of the year, as did Matt Bjorke of Roughstock for their album countdown. Liv Carter of Urban Country News gave the song a \"thumbs up\", adding \"what pulls it over the line however, and presumably why it has become a fan-favorite, is its sincerity in wishing to bring comfort and Underwood\u2019s confident performance.\" Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was less favorable, saying that \"the chorus of power ballad \"See You Again\" is marred by dated, campy arena-rock clich\u00e9s.\"\nThe song debuted at No. 60 on the US Country Airplay chart for the week of April 13, 2013, and peaked at No. 2 for the chart dated September 7, 2013.  It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 90 for the chart dated May 18, 2013, and peaked at No. 34 for the chart of August 31, 2013.  It also peaked at No.7 on the Hot Country Songs chart on August 24, 2013.

The full video premiered soon after on ABCNews.com. The music video was directed by Eric Welch. It showed the aftermaths of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the September 11 attacks and the 2013 Moore, Oklahoma, tornado, along with various reunions.\nDigital download\n\"See You Again\" \u2013 4:07\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Twitter - @carrieunderwood: Ok...I am so excited to announce...\" twitter.com.

The song was written by Zach Crowell, Brett James, and Hillary Lindsey, with production from Mark Bright, and was released as the third single from the album in the United States, being shipped to radio on April 3, 2016, and had an official impact date of April 11, 2016.\n\"Church Bells\" topped the Billboard Country Airplay chart, becoming Underwood's 15th leader on that chart and thereby extending her record as the female artist with most number-ones in history of that chart. It is her second number one from Storyteller on the Country Airplay chart. Underwood became the first woman in 2016 to have two number-ones on the chart. The song was certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA on July 23, 2020.\nThe song was nominated for Best Country Solo Performance at the 59th Grammy Awards.\nChurch Bells tells the story of Jenny, a poor girl who marries a rich oilman. However, she soon discovers her new husband is an abusive alcoholic. Jenny slips an untraceable poison into his drink and kills him.\nUnderwood said of the song, \"It's...like Fancy's little sister\", referencing Bobbie Gentry's hit song \"Fancy\", made famous by Reba McEntire. \u201cShe\u2019s young, she\u2019s pretty, she\u2019s poor, doing what she can to survive,\u201d Underwood explains, describing her \u201cChurch Bells\u201d heroine. \u201c(She) meets a man that has a lot of wealth and is supposed to take care of her.\u201d\nThe song received generally positive reviews. In their review of the album, Billboard said of the song, \"The first half holds a pair of Southern-gothic blockbusters that are the closest she has come to channeling McEntire\u2019s down-home storytelling: \u201cChoctaw County Affair,\u201d a tale of lovers silencing their would-be blackmailer, and \u201cChurch Bells,\u201d a rags-to-riches murder ballad in which a woman quietly offs her abusive husband.\" Rolling Stone called it \"the most epic domestic-violence-revenge-murder ballad in years\" and that it \"split the difference between Martina McBride's \"Independence Day\" and the Dixie Chicks \"Goodbye Earl\", but without the latter's safety-valve of humor.\"\nIn a mixed review, website Taste of Country said, \"on \u201cChurch Bells\u201d Underwood injects new drama into an oft-told tale. The Dixie Chicks \u201cGoodbye Earl\u201d relies on the same plot points, with Earl's fate being the same as the oil baron in this song\". The review was concluded by saying \"expect the song to perform well on country radio, even if it\u2019s not one that pushes her artistry forward as much as others on her most recent studio album\".\n\"Church Bells\" first charted at number 49 on the Hot Country Songs chart, selling 2,300 copies following the release of the parent album. It fell off the chart in the following week. After its release as the third official single and following Underwood's performance at the 51st Annual Academy of Country Music Awards, the song re-entered the Hot Country Songs chart at number 34 and peaked at number two, spending three consecutive weeks at that spot. It debuted at number 50 on the US Country Airplay chart and peaked at number one, becoming Underwood's 15th number one on that chart and extending her record for most number ones among women on that chart. Underwood became the first female artist of 2016 to have two number one hits on the Country Airplay chart, with \"Heartbeat\" and \"Church Bells\".\nFor the week ending May 28, 2016, it debuted at number 90 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and peaked at number 43.\nIn Canada, the song debuted at number 37 on the Canada Country chart and peaked at number two and debuted at number 100 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart and peaked at number 64.\nThe song has been certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA on July 23, 2020. As of January 2017, it has sold 456,000 copies in the United States.\nThe music video for the single was filmed  during the Storyteller Tour in Lincoln, Nebraska. The music video was released on May 10, 2016, and premiered on Good Morning America.\nUnderwood first performed the song live on the first stop of the Storyteller Tour in Jacksonville, Florida. She has since performed the song numerous times during the tour. Underwood's first televised performance of the song was at the 51st Annual Academy of Country Music Awards. She again performed the song live at the 2016 American Country Countdown Awards.\nUnderwood performed the song at the 2016 CMT Music Awards on June 8, 2016.

It was written by Underwood, Mike Elizondo, Brett James. It was released on September 14, 2009, by Arista Nashville as the lead single from her third studio album, Play On. The song sold 2,300,000 copies, making it the fourth-biggest single of her career behind \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\", \"Before He Cheats\", and \"Blown Away\".\nThe song received positive reviews from critics and became the fastest climbing country single of 2009. It also became Underwood's eighth number one country single in the United States. The single was certified 2xPlatinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nAfter the end of her \"Carnival Ride Tour\", in February 2009, Underwood began writing songs for her new album Play On. She collaborated with a number of producers which included Brett James, one of the three co-writers of her hit single \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\", and Mike Elizondo, who had collaborated with Eminem and Dr. Dre.  Elizondo came up with the main melody of the song, to which James and Underwood set the lyrics. James then suggested the title \"Cowboy Casanova\" off a list of potential titles that he had, and the  lyrics talk about a male character who is a \"devil in disguise.\" In an interview with CMT Underwood said,\n\"I think to every woman, this song would be telling a story about someone they know or met or has tried to pick them up in a bar\".  \"We're not trashing this guy, we're just warning these other girls about him.\"\nAn unfinished version of the song leaked online on September 2, 2009 after receiving airplay from KMPS-FM in Seattle. The label then rush-released the official version to Underwood's YouTube channel on September 3, 2009. It was officially made available for download on September 14, 2009.\n\"Cowboy Casanova\" is a moderately paced country song. It incorporates elements of rock-inspired guitar riffs and background gang vocals in the introduction and verses, and also the violin and banjo-esque qualities which travel into the refrain. The song is composed in D minor, set in common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Underwood's vocals span from A\u2083 to D\u2085.\nThe song has been met with generally favorable reviews. Billboard reviewed the song favorably, stating that it \"gives [Underwood] the chance to display the sassy side of her musical persona, which made previous hit \"Before He Cheats\" such an impact record. Blessed with a versatile set of pipes that make the best of any tune, Underwood shines on this steamy upbeat number\". Matt Bjorke of Roughstock also gave a favorable review, saying, \"Although the song borrows familiar melodic themes, the production is sparkling; Carrie sings the verses with rapid-fire precision and the hook is just infectious. This may very well be my favorite Carrie Underwood single yet.\" Kevin Coyne of Country Universe said that on \u201cCowboy Casanova\u201d, Underwood makes a strong attempt but doesn't quite pull it off. We\u2019re left with just a decent single that doesn't feel quite country enough or quite pop enough to make it a keeper, therefore giving her a grade of B-.\n\"Cowboy Casanova\" was released on September 14, 2009 for digital download. The song logged a first week sales of 110,236 copies in downloads. The song also made Underwood the only solo country artist in 2009 to debut a digital single above the 100,000. The song also became the fastest climbing single in Underwood's career and also the fastest-climbing single of 2009 in the country music genre. Additionally, the song gave Underwood the most Top 10 hits on the country chart this decade - 10 top 10 singles followed by Faith Hill and Martina McBride each with nine.\nAs of October 2015, 2,300,000 copies of \"Cowboy Casanova\" were sold in the US. It has been certified 2\u00d7 Platinum, being Underwood's fourth single to do so.\nThe music video was filmed on September 2, 2009, in New Orleans, Louisiana. It premiered during CMT's Big New Music Weekend on October 2, 2009.\nThe video was directed by Theresa Wingert and it features Underwood and an entourage of attractive female dancers all wearing flapper party gowns.  She warns the video's audience, as well as her entourage, about smooth-talking attractive men and their true intentions.  An attractive man sporting a fancy outfit that consists of an overcoat and a fedora gazes at the scene with interest.

The song served as the album's third single on November 18, 2012, through Arista Nashville. Written by Underwood, Hillary Lindsey, and Josh Kear, \"Two Black Cadillacs\" is a country pop song with lyrics addressing the story of two women who, when they realize they are both involved with the same man, decide to kill him. It was produced by Mark Bright, and the instrumentation was compared to songs by Dixie Chicks and Miranda Lambert.\nUpon its release, \"Two Black Cadillacs\" was met with positive reviews from music critics, who praised its story and Underwood's versatility as an artist. Commercially, the song was successful. In the United States, it reached number two on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, and also reached number 41 on the Hot 100. As of July 2020, \"Two Black Cadillacs\" was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song also charted in Canada at number three on the Country chart and at number 52 on the Canadian Hot 100.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by P.R. Brown, and filmed in Nashville, Tennessee. The video draws inspiration from Stephen King's novel Christine, and shows how the wife and mistress kill the cheating husband with a black Cadillac. It was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2013 Academy of Country Music Awards. Underwood has performed \"Two Black Cadillacs\" in a number of live appearances, including at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, where various images were projected onto the singer's gown, and at the 2013 Country Music Association Awards, in a medley with \"Good Girl\", \"See You Again\", and \"Blown Away\". It was also performed during the Blown Away Tour.\nAfter Underwood's Play On Tour ended in December 2010, she started to work on her then-untitled fourth studio album. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer \"took nearly a year to compile and record the songs.\" Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who previously wrote \"Before He Cheats\" for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts, worked on a track titled \"Blown Away\" and sent it to the singer. Underwood loved the song and recorded it, also naming her album Blown Away as it was the song that defined the album's darker direction. She then started writing material with several songwriters, including Hillary Lindsey and Kear. Together, the trio wrote \"Two Black Cadillacs\", which is about two women finding out that they both are involved in a relationship with the same man and set their differences aside to kill him. Underwood said that \"it was so much fun to write and just be in that room\" with Lindsey and Kear, as they \"didn't really know what to expect or where we were headed or what we would end up with.\" Kear described the writing session:\nCarrie had told me in an earlier writing appointment that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women got rid of the man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.\nMelodically, \"Two Black Cadillacs\" is written in the key of F minor, and is set in the common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Underwood's voice spans from the low note of A\u266d\u00b3 to the high note of C\u2075. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country noted that the lyrics of the song push \"the normally plucky country superstar to the edge of evil. It's as far as she can go without falling off the cliff of believability.\" Dukes also described the song as a \"mini-movie\", in which Underwood sings: \"And the preacher said he was a good man / And his brother said he was a good friend / But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry / Bye, bye / Yeah they took turns laying a rose down / Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground / He's not the only one who had a secret to hide / Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.\" The country pop instrumentation includes piano, brooding strings and a guitar,"

It was written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and was released by Sire Records as the album's third single on August 1, 1989. \"Cherish\" was built around the themes of love and relationships, with William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet being one of the major inspirations. The track also included a line from \"Cherish\" by the 1960s band the Association. Musically constructed as a doo-wop-style pop song, it is regarded as a light-hearted track by critics and includes instruments such as a drum machine, percussions, keyboards and a saxophone. Lyrically, it speaks of Madonna's devotion to her lover, and her promise to be always by his side. \"Cherish\" was included on Madonna's greatest hits compilations The Immaculate Collection (1990) and Celebration (2009).\nAfter its release, the song received positive feedback from reviewers, who were surprised by the change of content and the lighter image of Madonna's music in contrast to her previous singles from Like a Prayer, which incorporated themes such as religion and sexuality. They compared certain lyrics of the song to Juliet's lines in William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. \"Cherish\" was a commercial success, topping the Canadian music chart and reaching the top ten of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the combined European chart. In the United States, \"Cherish\" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Madonna the record for the most consecutive top-five singles by any act with 16.\nA black-and-white music video for the song was directed by photographer Herb Ritts at the Paradise Cove Beach in Malibu, California. In the video, Madonna plays herself, while three co-actors dressed as mermen swim in and out of the sea. Academics noted that the mermen became symbols for the homosexual community and the oppression it faced. Madonna performed \"Cherish\" on her Blond Ambition World Tour (1990), where the performance included her dancers dressed up as mermen. Its symbolism was seen to de-sexualize men, relegating them to objects of desire.\n\"Cherish\" was written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and released as the third single from Like a Prayer (1989). The song is built around the themes of love and relationships, with William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet one of its major inspirations. Madonna was reading Romeo and Juliet during the breaks during rehearsals for Speed the Plow, a Broadway show in which she was starring in 1988. On the third day of the Like a Prayer recording sessions, she presented Leonard with the lyrics of \"Cherish\", and explained that she had written the song \"one sunny afternoon by the beach\", but later confessed that it was actually written in her make-up room. \"I wrote it in a superhyper-positive state of mind that I knew was not going to last\", the singer recalled. Leonard introduced one line from the similar titled song by the 1960s band the Association, \"Cherish is the word I use\", after which Madonna decided to include it on Like a Prayer. The B-side of the single release of \"Cherish\" was a previously unreleased track called \"Supernatural\", initially composed during the recording sessions of her third studio album, True Blue and later completed in 1989. In 2009, during an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna confessed that she had never been able to predict if her songs would be successful, irrespective of her personal opinion of them. As an example, she cited \"Cherish\" as one of the most \"retarded\" songs she had written, but noted it became a commercial success. The song was also included on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and the two-disc edition of her 2009 compilation Celebration.\n\"Cherish\" is a doo-wop style pop shuffle song and opened the second side of Like a Prayer. It begins with the sound of synths and keyboard and Madonna repeatedly singing the words \"cherish, cherish\". This is followed by the sound from drum machine, as percussion and guitars accompany her voice. During the bridge, Madonna sings the line \"Cupid please take your aim at me\", as the keyboard sound becomes pronounced. The drum changes its rhythm and Madonna moves into the chorus, \"Cherish the joy/of always having you here by my side\", accompanied by background vocals and a bass guitar. The second verse continues in the same way, with"

Underwood announced the single on her official Twitter account.\nUnderwood debuted the song on the twelfth season of American Idol on April 4, 2013. \"See You Again\" is Underwood's eighteenth consecutive Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and is also her seventeenth single to be certified at least Gold by the RIAA. As of December 2013, the single has sold 740,000 copies in the United States. On August 10, 2015, \"See You Again\" was officially certified as Platinum.\n\"See You Again\" tells the story of moving onwards after experiencing the death of a loved one in life. The lyrics provide hope and promise through Underwood's belief that one will reunite with every fallen loved one in the afterlife. The song's opening consists of a solo piano, followed by a backing chorus and band kicking in shortly after.\n\"See You Again\" was originally one of three songs written for the 2010 feature film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Of the three songs that Underwood, Hodges, and Lindsey co-wrote for the film, the workers behind the project opted to choose \"There's a Place For Us.\" Underwood pushed to include \"See You Again\" on her fourth studio album, Blown Away, during the writing process of the album.\nSee You Again is written in the key of A-flat major, with a vocal range from F3 to D\u266d5.\nThe song has received positive reviews from music critics. Billboard.com described the song to be \"truly a taste of heaven.\" Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe included the song in his personal favorite tracks from the Blown Away studio album in the website's 2012 year-end countdown of editors' favorite Country albums of the year, as did Matt Bjorke of Roughstock for their album countdown. Liv Carter of Urban Country News gave the song a \"thumbs up\", adding \"what pulls it over the line however, and presumably why it has become a fan-favorite, is its sincerity in wishing to bring comfort and Underwood\u2019s confident performance.\" Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was less favorable, saying that \"the chorus of power ballad \"See You Again\" is marred by dated, campy arena-rock clich\u00e9s.\"\nThe song debuted at No. 60 on the US Country Airplay chart for the week of April 13, 2013, and peaked at No. 2 for the chart dated September 7, 2013.  It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 90 for the chart dated May 18, 2013, and peaked at No. 34 for the chart of August 31, 2013.  It also peaked at No.7 on the Hot Country Songs chart on August 24, 2013.  As of December 2013, the single has sold 740,000 copies in the United States.\nOn August 10, 2015 \"See You Again\" was officially certified as Platinum.\n\n\n\nOn June 7, 2013, Good Morning America gave a first look for the music video for \"See You Again\". The full video premiered soon after on ABCNews.com. The music video was directed by Eric Welch. It showed the aftermaths of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the September 11 attacks and the 2013 Moore, Oklahoma, tornado, along with various reunions.\nDigital download\n\"See You Again\" \u2013 4:07\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Twitter - @carrieunderwood: Ok...I am so excited to announce...\" twitter.com.

It went to number two on the US Billboard National Disco Action Top 30 (now the Dance Club Songs chart) for two weeks. It became a crossover hit, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and found worldwide success, reaching the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands and South Africa. A re-release in 1994 allowed the song to reach number four in New Zealand and number five in Iceland.\nThe song was co-written by Alicia Bridges and Susan Hutcheson in 1977 for Bill Lowery, founder of Southern Music. \"I Love the Nightlife\" was the first single produced by Steve Buckingham who was invited to produce the single's parent album entitled Alicia Bridges after he had played guitar on a session by the singer. Bridges suggested to Hutcheson that they write a song with either \"disco\" or \"boogie\" in the title after Bridges saw a current top-ten hit list featuring several songs with dance-oriented titles. The original title of the resultant song: \"Disco 'Round\", became the subtitle under the main title \"I Love the Nightlife\" as Buckingham considered it an R&B number and did not want it labeled disco. Bridges herself would later admit that she had hopes that the song would be received as a Memphis soul number, calling it \"something Al Green might sing\". However it is as a disco classic that the song is most remembered: in an August 26, 1998 MTV countdown of the Top 54 Dance Songs of the Disco Era, \"I Love the Nightlife\" was ranked at number 37.\nIn 1994, the song gained renewed interest after being featured in the film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. It was subsequently re-released and found the best success in New Zealand, where it reached number four in February 1995, 12 places higher than its original peak of number 16. The re-release also reached number five in Iceland and number 11 in Australia. Because of its association with the film (and also because Bridges herself is an open lesbian), the song is closely linked with gay culture. It was remixed for this release.\nA music video was directed by Bruce Gowers.\nIn 1994, a new video was produced featuring Hugo Weaving, star of the film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\n\n\n\n\nLaura Branigan sang the song live on German television and it was included on the very rare compilation album Gut Gestimmt in 1980.\nIn 1995 the song was released by the band Bronski Beat labeled \"I Luv The Nightlife\", which featured two remix versions of the original song and two remix versions of the alternate song Hit That Perfect Beat Boy.\nIt was re-recorded by Latin singer La India and Nuyorican Soul as a track on the soundtrack for the film The Last Days of Disco. This version peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\nIn 2003 it was performed by Taylor Dayne in the television special The Disco Ball.\nIn The Simpsons episode \"Homer's Phobia\", Homer dances to the song. In another episode, \"I'm with Cupid\", Apu taught a parrot to sing \"I Love The Nightlife\" with clever new lyrics to Manjula. Marge was impressed although she hates the song; Homer admits that he hates it as well. It was also featured in the episode \"A Milhouse Divided\", with Luann Van Houten humming it while burning Kirk's storage boxes. It also can be heard in the 2008 episode \"Mypods and Boomsticks\" in Studio 54 when Itchy travels back to Studio 54 in the \"Itchy & Scratchy\" short.\nIn the 1979 horror-comedy film Love At First Bite, the vampire Dracula and his would-be bride dance to the song in a disco. The 2007 DVD release of the movie features a different song in the relevant scene, however the 2015 release by Shout! Factory restored the original song.\nIn the movie So I Married An Axe Murderer, Mike Myers's character quotes the lyrics from the chorus during a conversation with his love interest in the movie.\nIn the Jeopardy! round of the May 29, 2006 episode of Jeopardy!, the last two categories were \"I Love the Nightlife\" (about cities at night) and \"I Got to Boogie\" (about famous escapees).\nFeatured in the film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), and stage musical, Priscilla Queen of the Desert \u2013 the Musical\nFeatured in the short documentary film \"Ladies Please!\" (1995)\nThai 1995 MC Jeans ad show two men"

It was based on an idea originally suggested by former head of A&R Jerry Love after he visited clubs in New York and saw people endlessly chanting \"Ooh-ah, Ooh-ah\". Although Zager was first embarrassed when Love asked him to write a song using these chants, he accepted the proposal and later co-wrote \"Let's All Chant\" with Fields.\nThe opening track and lead single from the group's eponymous LP, \"Let's All Chant\" was released as a single in December 1977, with the track \"Love Express\" as a B-side. An unexpected smash hit, the single reached number one on the disco chart and crossed over to the Soul Singles chart, where it peaked at number 15, and to the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 36. In Europe, the single reached the top 10 in several countries, including the UK, Ireland and France. It eventually sold five million copies worldwide.\nRecognizable by both its vocal hooks and its classical section, which is featured in the middle of the song, \"Let's All Chant\" was well received by critics, who have praised its musical arrangement and its catchiness. Many reviewers regard the song as a classic of the disco era. It also became a turning point in Michael Zager's career. As well as being used in many TV advertisements and movies, it has become an influential dance song which has been extensively covered or remixed by numerous artists and has been interpolated or sampled in many other tracks.\nWhen he was still at A&M Records, Michael Zager met Jerry Love, a former head of A&R. After Love subsequently left the record label, he and Zager formed the Michael Zager Moon's Band in 1976. Love frequented Studio 54 and went to clubs every night. One evening, he went to Greenwich Village to visit several clubs and noted that people were continuously singing \"Ooh-ah, Ooh-ah\" to every tune which was played in order to increase their own participation and pleasure. The next day, he described the scene to Zager and suggested that Zager write a song incorporating the \"Ooh-ah, Ooh-ah\" vocals. Zager told Love: \"You have to be kidding; that's embarrassing!\" Love commented that everybody was doing it and that if Zager wrote a song using these chants, dancers would love it.\nIn parallel, the group's name was changed to the Michael Zager Band and they signed with the label Private Stock Records. For their forthcoming LP, Zager wrote two songs, \"Let's All Chant\" and \"Love Express\", together with Alvin Fields. The co-writer shared lead vocals on \"Let's All Chant\" with session singers Dollette McDonald and Billy Baker. Zager added a classical section to the track. He later remarked:\nThe reason I added the piccolo trumpet and classical section in the middle of \"Let's All Chant\" was mainly because I was embarrassed! I thought it was so stupid with that \"Ooh-ah\" sound in it that I wanted to add something to lift the track musically. I have a classical background and went to a music conservatory, so I was really feeling embarrassed\n\"Let's All Chant\" and \"Love Express\" were both recorded at the Secret Sound Studios, in Manhattan. Once the tracks were recorded, Zager told Fields: \"I'm gonna kill you if this isn't a hit!\"\n\"Let's All Chant\" is a disco song driven by a repetitive bassline, handclaps and numerous vocal hooks (such as \"Ah-ah, eh-eh, let's all chant\" and \"Your body, my body, everybody work your body\"). These typical disco lyrics are about dancing and working one's body. The song's instrumentation also includes Afro-Cuban drums, a \"rollicking\" piano line and an ensemble of wind instruments, marked by a piccolo trumpet solo which sounds \"like it's straight out of the Dynasty opening theme song\". The song's tempo is 121 bpm and is very close to the average tempo of a standard disco song (120 bpm). According to AllMusic reviewer Alex Henderson, the combination of the \"European-influenced, oddly baroque\" feeling with a \"catchy disco/funk beat\" grabs the attention of the listener and encourages him to discover the rest of the eponymous LP.\n\"Let's All Chant\" was released as a single with \"Love Express\" as a B-side in December 1977, on Christmas week. Zager thought it was the worst time to release the single because many artists usually released their albums during this period and thought the single would only become a \"disco hit\". However, the single became an unexpected smash hit. It climbed to number one on the disco chart on February 18, 1978, knocking Cerrone's \"Supernature\" off the top spot, and remained atop the chart for"

It features American musician Nile Rodgers, and was co-written by Sia Furler in collaboration with Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. The track was produced by Elliott Wheeler and The Get Down director, Baz Luhrmann. While it was available to download from the soundtrack upon its release, it was promoted in Italy to contemporary hit radio as a single on August 23, 2016. Various remixes were also released throughout the following month.\nMusically, \"Telepathy\" is a disco track reminiscent of the genre in the 1970s, reflecting the theme of the TV series, which documents the fall of disco and the rise of hip hop in that era. Aguilera's strong vocals were praised by music critics, with one in particular comparing her falsetto melismas to the style of Mariah Carey. \"Telepathy\" became Aguilera's ninth and Rodgers' fourth number-one song on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, respectively. As a thank you gift to her fans, radio, and DJs for playing the track and making it number-one on the chart, Aguilera self-produced a short, disco-themed music video for the song.\nComposed and written by Sia Furler, Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, \"Telepathy\" is a song recorded by Christina Aguilera featuring Nile Rodgers for the accompanying soundtrack to the Netflix musical drama series The Get Down (2016). The Get Down, directed by Australian Baz Luhrmann, is set in The Bronx in the late 1970s and chronicles the fall of disco and the rise of hip hop. Luhrmann, alongside Elliot Wheeler, produced \"Telepathy\", marking the second time he and Aguilera had worked together; Luhrmann directed the 2001 musical film Moulin Rouge! whereby Aguilera was one of the lead acts on the soundtrack single \"Lady Marmalade\". Furler recorded a demo version of the song but it has never been officially released.\nThe track listing for the soundtrack was released on August 4, 2016; Mike Wass of Idolator noted that \"Telepathy\" could possibly be a disco track given that Rodgers is credited as a featured artist and the disco theme of the series. \"Telepathy\" premiered on August 11, the day before the release of the soundtrack and TV series. The song was released in Italy to contemporary hit radio on August 23. Multiple remixes were commissioned and made available for digital download. On September 16, a six-track remix EP was released featuring remixes by Rare Candy, Eric Kupper, Solidisco, Malay & Young Bombs, Tobtok and Moto Blanco. Another remix by Le Youth was released September 30. Daniel Megarry of the Gay Times suggested that the release of the remixes was an effort to boost sales of the track.\n\"Telepathy\" is a disco song which lasts for a duration of three minutes, eleven seconds. The \"dreamy\" and \"euphoric\" instrumentation, provided by Nile Rodgers, Homer Steinweiss, Nick Movshon and Thomas Brenneck, consists of \"vibrant\" strings and horns, drums, brass and harps. PopCrush writer Bradley Stern noted that the addition of Rodgers \"signature joyful, dance floor-friendly\" sound adds a \"touch of authenticity\". Producer Nelson George described the track as being reminiscent of \"1970s vogueing anthems popular at vogue-club balls like the House of LaBeija.\" Entertainment Weekly writer Joey Nolfi placed \"Telepathy\" somewhere in between the compositions of her fifth studio album Back to Basics (2006) and the lead single from her seventh album Lotus, \"Your Body\" (2012).\n\"Telepathy\" garnered a positive response from music critics. Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass was initially underwhelmed by \"Telepathy\" upon its release. According to him, he downloaded the song regardless, and added it to what he calls his \"Upbeat Xtina\" playlist. He writes that a few months later, the song played on shuffle and he realized that he had previously brushed off what he now believed to be one of the best and most underrated songs of 2016. Robbie Daw of the same publication was complimentary of Aguilera's vocal performance, opining that she \"sings beautifully amidst a swirling wall of sound.\" He continued to write that it was a welcome change of tempo following the release of her previous single, \"Change\".\nBradley Stern from PopCrush described the song as a \"shimmering, strut-friendly contribution to the soundtrack\" and"

In some countries, including the UK, Ireland and New Zealand, the band was credited as 'Starsound' and only the medley itself was named \"Stars on 45\".\nIts official title in the US and Canada (as on the record and in Billboard and RPM) is \"Medley: Intro 'Venus' / Sugar Sugar / No Reply / I'll Be Back / Drive My Car / Do You Want to Know a Secret / We Can Work It Out / I Should Have Known Better / Nowhere Man / You're Going to Lose That Girl / Stars on 45\" and was credited to 'Stars on 45'. It is (to date) the longest titled song to ever chart in Billboard and was conveniently shortened to \"Stars on 45 Medley\", or \"'Medley' by Stars on 45\". The length of the name surpassed the previous record set by Ray Stevens' \"Jeremiah Peabody's Polyunsaturated Quick-Dissolving Fast-Acting Pleasant-Tasting Green and Purple Pills;\" and (among songs that reached number one) \"(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song\"  by B. J. Thomas.  The reason for the long title was copyright requirements for the use of The Beatles' songs.\nIt reached number 1 in the Netherlands on February 21, 1981; number 2 in the UK in April 1981; and number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on June 20, 1981. In the US, the single also peaked at number 18 on the dance chart. In the US, the song's one-week stay at the top of the Hot 100 interrupted the Kim Carnes single \"Bette Davis Eyes\" run as the number 1 single at five weeks. The next week, Carnes' song regained its number 1 status for an additional four weeks.\nThe origin of the single was the Netherlands where numerous bootleg disco singles were floating around. Willem van Kooten, the owner of one of the copyrights, decided to make a similar, legitimate record of a 12\" single titled \"Let's Do It in the 80s Great Hits\" credited to a Canadian group called Passion (though the snippets of songs were taken from the original recordings). He found singers who sounded similar to John Lennon and Paul McCartney and decided to make the single focus on The Beatles. The Beatles medley was later extended to a full 16-minute album side. It appeared on the Stars on 45's first full-length release, Long Play Album (US title: Stars on Long Play; UK title: Stars on 45 - The Album).\nThe album version of the song moved \"Venus\" and \"Sugar Sugar\" to Side Two into a different medley, and added several more Beatles songs as well as a 32-second instrumental extract from George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord\" and even a fleeting reference to new wave band Sparks' \"Beat the Clock,\" for a total length of about 15 minutes. The album version was released as Long Play Album in the Netherlands, and retitled Stars on Long Play in the US and Stars on 45 \u2014 The Album in the UK. A detailed listing of the source material can be found in the Long Play Album article.\nThe song also became a huge success in the UK where it kicked off a craze for medleys, with a large number of records in the Stars on 45 mould reaching the UK Top 40 in 1981. For example, The Hollies recorded \"Holliedaze\", a medley of some of their previous hits, which reached 28 on the UK charts with Graham Nash and Eric Haydock briefly rejoining the group in September 1981 to promote the record. Likewise, in the US the song started a medley craze that lasted for about a year and introduced not only other medleys by Stars on 45, but medleys by the Beatles themselves, The Beach Boys, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Larry Elgart and His Manhattan Swing Orchestra, as well as others.\n\nSide one\n\"Stars on 45\" (Medley - 7\" Mix) - 4:48 (US: - 4:05)\n\"Stars on 45\" (Eggermont, Duiser - omitted on the US version)\n\"Venus\" (van Leeuwen)\n\"Sugar, Sugar\" (Kim, Barry)\n\"No Reply\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"I'll Be Back\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Drive My Car\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"We Can Work It Out\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"I Should Have Known Better\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Nowhere Man\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"You're Going to Lose That Girl\" (Lennon, McCartney)\n\"Stars on 45\" (Eggermont, Duiser)\nIncludes uncredited musical references to Sparks' song \"Beat the Clock\"\nSide two\n\"Stars on 45\" (Theme - 7\" Mix) (Eggermont, Duiser) - 3:30\nIncludes uncredited musical references to Lipps Inc.'s \"Funkytown\" and The"

It was written and produced by Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley, and Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon, with additional writing from James Fauntleroy. It was released as the third single from the album on February 24, 2014. The song is a mid-tempo pop ballad, that makes use of an acoustic guitar throughout, with its lyrics centering on the semantic field of love.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" received positive reviews from several contemporary music critics. The song's music video premiered on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on March 20, 2014. It is a mini documentary, that follows two documentary filmmakers searching for a couple that got engaged on January 12, 2014, while heading to New York City on the Long Island Rail Road train, with the man proposing to his girlfriend to \"Not a Bad Thing\". The video concludes with the filmmakers being led to several false leads, with a second part of the video to follow. Timberlake performed the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and during The 20/20 Experience World Tour. The song reached number 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Mainstream Top 40.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" was written by Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley, Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon, and James Fauntleroy. The song was produced by Timbaland, Timberlake, and Harmon. Timberlake arranged and produced his vocals, which were recorded at Larabee Studios in North Hollywood, California. Harmon provided keyboards for the song, while Elliot Ives and Timberlake played the guitar. The track was engineered by Chris Godbey, and mixed by Jimmy Douglass, Godbey and Timberlake, with assistance from Alejandro Baima, at Larabee Studios.\nRCA executives reportedly believed that \"Not a Bad Thing\" could be The 20/20 Experience \u2013 2 of 2's largest commercial success. However, they instead opted to release \"Take Back the Night\" and \"TKO\" first, to represent the album's R&B sound and distinguish \"Not a Bad Thing\" from the sonically similar \"Mirrors\". A radio edit of the song was digitally released on February 24, 2014 in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The next day, it impacted the contemporary hit radio in the United States. On March 31 was sent to US adult contemporary radio and on May 27 to its UK equivalent. \"Not a Bad Thing\" was released as a CD single in Austria, Germany and Switzerland; apart of the radio edit of the song it also featured the \"TKO (Black Friday Remix)\". \"Not a Bad Thing\" impacted the mainstream radio in Italy on June 4.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" is a mid-tempo pop ballad, with a running duration of 11 minutes and 28 seconds; the album version has an included hidden track entitled \"Pair of Wings\". Critics noted the song's resemblance to songs by former boy band NSYNC, which Timberlake had previously been a member of. and the song's focus on the theme of love. PopMatters' Brice Ezell saw \"Not a Bad Thing\" to share the same characteristics as NSYNC's 1999 \"(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You\", using the same \"emotional earnestness\" which made the latter song the \"heart-melter\" it was during its release. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times described the song as a \"dewy, blue-eyed soul number\" that was realized when Timberlake was discovering the \"emotional possibilities of his singing\" during his time with the boy band. Holly Gleason of Paste interpreted the lyrics as endorsing love, with the song contrasting the previous tracks on The 20/20 Experience\u00a0\u2013 2 of 2, celebrating the \"happily ever after trope for all its worth\".\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" received general acclaim from critics. Jeremy Thomas of 411mania.com selected \"Not a Bad Thing\" as one of the stand-out tracks from The 20/20 Experience\u00a0\u2013 2 of 2, using it as an example of a song from the album that \"has a gentle side that can be appreciated,\" noting it as a \"lovely close\" to the album. Similarly selecting the track as a stand-out, Chris Bosman of Consequence of Sound saw the song serving as the \"pitch perfect\" nostalgic track, pointing out its 'NSYNC influence. As well as depicting the latter influence, Melinda Newman of HitFix awarded the track an A grade, labeling it as a \"lovely, lilting straight-up pop tune.\" David Meller of musicOMH described the track as"

It was released on 29 April 2016, through Columbia Records and Westbury Road. The song was written by Harris and American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who was initially credited with the pseudonym Nils Sj\u00f6berg. Rihanna and Harris had previously collaborated on her sixth studio album, Talk That Talk, which included the international chart-topper \"We Found Love\" and US top five single \"Where Have You Been\", the former of which was written and produced by Harris. He played the final version for Rihanna at the 2016 Coachella Music Festival. It was also played at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final after the conclusion of the match.\nThe single debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart. It peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Rihanna's 21st top-five song and Harris's second; the song is currently Harris's highest-peaking single as a lead artist. It became Rihanna's 25th and Harris's fourth chart-topper on the Dance Club Songs and also reached number one on the US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs; the single became the 12th number one for Rihanna and Harris's tenth on the sister chart Dance/Mix Show Airplay. It topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and the Republic of Ireland and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Germany, New Zealand and Switzerland. A music video for the song premiered on 17 June 2016 and features Rihanna in an open cube with images projected on the inside walls.\nCalvin Harris presented the final recording to Rihanna, two weeks prior to its release. During his performance at Coachella, Harris shared the song with Rihanna and her manager in her trailer. Harris stated that he was \"nervous\" to play her the song because he had \"changed so many bits from when she first heard it.\" The song was released on 29 April 2016. The song marks the pair's third collaboration, following the global chart-topper \"We Found Love\" and the Billboard Hot 100 top-five single \"Where Have You Been\", which are both featured on Rihanna's sixth studio album, Talk That Talk (2011).\nI think, when a pseudonym comes in is when you still have a love for making the work and you don\u2019t want the work to become overshadowed by this thing that\u2019s been built around you, based on what people know about you. And that's when it's really fun to create fake names and write under them. I wrote under the name Nils Sj\u00f6berg because those are two of the most popular names of Swedish males. I wrote this song called \"This Is What You Came For\" that Rihanna ended up singing. And nobody knew for a while. I remembered always hearing that when Prince wrote \"Manic Monday\", they didn't reveal it for a couple of months.\n\u2014\u2009Swift on penning the song, Rolling Stone\nHarris and Nils Sj\u00f6berg were credited as the songwriters and producers. On 13 July 2016, TMZ reported that the track was written by American singer-songwriter and Harris's then-girlfriend Taylor Swift, who used the pseudonym Nils Sj\u00f6berg because they did not want their relationship to overshadow the song. The track became a point of contention upon its release, when Harris\u2014in response to being asked about the possibility of collaborating with Swift during an interview with Ryan Seacrest\u2014said that he \"can't see it happening.\" Harris eventually confirmed on his Twitter account that Swift wrote the lyrics and contributed some background vocals, while he \"wrote the music, produced the song, arranged it and cut [Rihanna's] vocals\". He also confirmed Swift's previous request for secrecy as co-writer. The credit has since been officially changed to \"Taylor Swift\" in BMI's and ASCAP's entry for the song.\n\"This Is What You Came For\" is an EDM song. Gil Kaufman of Billboard stated that the song is \"a chilled-out, joyful club track that nods to classic Chicago house from the late 1980s and early 1990s, but with a modern, poppier flavor.\" The song is written in the key of C major with a tempo of 124 beats per minute. The song follows a chord progression of Am\u2013Fmaj7\u2013G\u2013C, and Rihanna's vocals span from G\u2083 to E\u2085, amounting to 2 different octaves.\n\n\"This Is What You Came For\" received mixed reviews. Lary Barleet from NME stated that \"As it builds to a climax, he pulls it right back, eschewing the EDM drop in favour of voguish and mellow tropical house.

It was written and produced by Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley, and Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon, with additional writing from James Fauntleroy. It was released as the third single from the album on February 24, 2014. The song is a mid-tempo pop ballad, that makes use of an acoustic guitar throughout, with its lyrics centering on the semantic field of love.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" received positive reviews from several contemporary music critics. The song's music video premiered on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on March 20, 2014. It is a mini documentary, that follows two documentary filmmakers searching for a couple that got engaged on January 12, 2014, while heading to New York City on the Long Island Rail Road train, with the man proposing to his girlfriend to \"Not a Bad Thing\". The video concludes with the filmmakers being led to several false leads, with a second part of the video to follow. Timberlake performed the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and during The 20/20 Experience World Tour. The song reached number 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Mainstream Top 40.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" was written by Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley, Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon, and James Fauntleroy. The song was produced by Timbaland, Timberlake, and Harmon. Timberlake arranged and produced his vocals, which were recorded at Larabee Studios in North Hollywood, California. Harmon provided keyboards for the song, while Elliot Ives and Timberlake played the guitar. The track was engineered by Chris Godbey, and mixed by Jimmy Douglass, Godbey and Timberlake, with assistance from Alejandro Baima, at Larabee Studios.\nRCA executives reportedly believed that \"Not a Bad Thing\" could be The 20/20 Experience \u2013 2 of 2's largest commercial success. However, they instead opted to release \"Take Back the Night\" and \"TKO\" first, to represent the album's R&B sound and distinguish \"Not a Bad Thing\" from the sonically similar \"Mirrors\". A radio edit of the song was digitally released on February 24, 2014 in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The next day, it impacted the contemporary hit radio in the United States. On March 31 was sent to US adult contemporary radio and on May 27 to its UK equivalent. \"Not a Bad Thing\" was released as a CD single in Austria, Germany and Switzerland; apart of the radio edit of the song it also featured the \"TKO (Black Friday Remix)\". \"Not a Bad Thing\" impacted the mainstream radio in Italy on June 4.\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" is a mid-tempo pop ballad, with a running duration of 11 minutes and 28 seconds; the album version has an included hidden track entitled \"Pair of Wings\". Critics noted the song's resemblance to songs by former boy band NSYNC, which Timberlake had previously been a member of. and the song's focus on the theme of love. PopMatters' Brice Ezell saw \"Not a Bad Thing\" to share the same characteristics as NSYNC's 1999 \"(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You\", using the same \"emotional earnestness\" which made the latter song the \"heart-melter\" it was during its release. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times described the song as a \"dewy, blue-eyed soul number\" that was realized when Timberlake was discovering the \"emotional possibilities of his singing\" during his time with the boy band. Holly Gleason of Paste interpreted the lyrics as endorsing love, with the song contrasting the previous tracks on The 20/20 Experience\u00a0\u2013 2 of 2, celebrating the \"happily ever after trope for all its worth\".\n\"Not a Bad Thing\" received general acclaim from critics. Jeremy Thomas of 411mania.com selected \"Not a Bad Thing\" as one of the stand-out tracks from The 20/20 Experience\u00a0\u2013 2 of 2, using it as an example of a song from the album that \"has a gentle side that can be appreciated,\" noting it as a \"lovely close\" to the album. Similarly selecting the track as a stand-out, Chris Bosman of Consequence of Sound saw the song serving as the \"pitch perfect\" nostalgic track, pointing out its 'NSYNC influence. As well as depicting the latter influence, Melinda Newman of HitFix awarded the track an A grade, labeling it as a \"lovely, lilting straight-up pop tune.\" David Meller of musicOMH described the track as"

It was written and produced by Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley and Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon, with additional writing by James Fauntleroy. \"Tunnel Vision\" was digitally released on June 14, 2013 by RCA Records as the third single from the album. It is a mid-tempo R&B song with EDM influence and instrumentation featuring Timbaland's signature ad-libs, record-scratching, heavy drums, melodic bass, orchestration and synthesizer. Its lyrics proclaim Timberlake's tunnel vision for his love interest, with several voyeuristic references.\n\"Tunnel Vision\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, most of whom praised Timbaland's production, and it was cited as The 20/20 Experience's highlight. After the album's release, the song charted in South Korea and the United States because of high digital sales. It debuted on the singles chart in South Korea at number 27, selling 6,670 digital copies in its first week. \"Tunnel Vision\" peaked at number 40 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number eight on the UK R&B Singles Chart.\nThe music video for \"Tunnel Vision\" was directed by Jonathan Craven, Simon McLoughlin and Jeff Nicholas, and premiered on July 3 on Timberlake's Vevo channel. In the seven-minute video, Timberlake and Timbaland watch nude women and dance. Critics labeled the video NSFW and compared it to the video for Robin Thicke's 2013 single, \"Blurred Lines\". Originally banned on YouTube, it was later posted with the condition that viewers disclose their age. The song was part of the set list for Timberlake's 2013 Legends of the Summer concert tour with rapper Jay-Z and his fifth solo tour, the 2013\u201315 20/20 Experience World Tour.\n\"Tunnel Vision\" was written by Justin Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley, Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon and James Fauntleroy, and produced by Timbaland, Timberlake and Harmon. Timberlake arranged and produced his vocals, which were recorded at Larabee Studios in North Hollywood, California. Other instrumentalists were Harmon on keyboards and Elliot Ives on guitar. The song was engineered by Chris Godbey (assisted by Alejandro Baima) and mixed by Jimmy Douglass, Godbey and Timberlake at Larabee Studios.\nOn June 10, 2013 Timberlake introduced the artwork for the \"Tunnel Vision\" single, a black-and-white close-up of the singer's face in the silhouette of a nude woman. Kia Macarechi of The Huffington Post found the artwork unpleasant and unusual; according to Justin Myers of the Official Charts Company, Timberlake \"seems to be playing up to his naughty nickname of Trousersnake with the cover\". Zach Dionne of New York's Vulture website called the cover \"awful boobnose single art\", committing to \"the smoky naked woman vibe\". \"Tunnel Vision\" and its radio edit were digitally released in France and Italy on June 14 on Amazon. That day, the single was also released in Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden on 7 Digital and the iTunes Store. It was released on June 17 in Norway, the following day in Spain and on June 21 in Switzerland.\n\"Tunnel Vision\" is a mid-tempo R&B song with an EDM influence. Billboard's Jason Lipshutz noted that it has an instrumentation that features \"fizzing beats abetted by the producer's [Timbaland] signature ad-libs and vocal record-scratches\", while according to Sobhi Youssef of Sputnikmusic the song is built on \"still-existing chops with a drum heavy, syncopated backbone amidst frenetically shifting bass melodies, sweeping orchestrations, and vacuous synths that all coalesce into a fuzzed out boom-bap.\" Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media called the synthesizer \"sinister\" and, according to Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson, it has Middle Eastern tones. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle called the beats and vocal loops on \"Tunnel Vision\" reminiscent of Timbaland's past work with the late American singer Aaliyah. According to Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post, its beat resembles that on 50 Cent's 2007 single \"Ayo Technology\" (also featuring Timberlake).\n\"Tunnel Vision\" features \"thrilling\" evolutions in production and arrangement complementing Timberlake's vocals, "

It was released in December 1995 as the lead single from their only album of the same name and went on to top the charts of at least five countries: Australia, Austria, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. Outside New Zealand, OMC is generally considered a one-hit wonder; they had a further few successful singles in New Zealand, including \"On the Run\" and \"Land of Plenty\". The song was featured in the 1998 movies Palmetto and Disney's The Parent Trap and plays at the start of the first episode of the second season of American sitcom Clueless.\nThe song won the award for \"Single of the Year\" at the 1996 New Zealand Music Awards. It was also featured on Nature's Best 2, as the 34th greatest New Zealand song of all time as voted for by members of the Australasian Performing Right Association in 2001. In 2002, the song was named as the 71st greatest one-hit wonder of all time on a VH1 countdown hosted by William Shatner.\nRoss Jones from The Guardian called the song \"supernaturally summery\", noting that it \"combines a proto-electro beat, a funky Mariachi guitar, Tex-Mex trumpets, girly close harmonies, and a goofy rap\". Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote, \"Polynesian pop with a twist. Pauly Fuemana has a gravelly, deep voice and a major rap attitude. The Spanish guitar, trumpet and the sweet female background vocals create a radio friendly mood. This single from the forthcoming album Time Is Money smashed New Zealand and Australian sales figures; OMC's quirky catchiness should kick up some dust in Europe too.\" British trade paper Music Week rated it four out of five, adding, \"A smash in Australia and NZ, this mix of male vocals with Spanish guitar and a samba/dance beat could be a surprise hit if radio latches on.\"\n\"How Bizarre\" topped the singles charts in New Zealand, Australia, Austria, Canada and Ireland. As the track was only released to radio in the United States, with no commercial single made available to buy, the song was not allowed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 under the chart rules in place at the time. However, it topped the Mainstream Top 40 for a week, then called the Pop Singles. It also peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart. The single was number one for one week in Canada, two weeks in Austria, three weeks in Ireland, three weeks in New Zealand and five weeks in Australia. On 9 February 2010, the song re-entered the New Zealand charts at number 40 after Fuemana's death.\nA music video was released to help promote the single. The video has lead singer Pauly Fuemana driving a 1968 Chevrolet Impala. It also pictures him dancing, rapping, throwing around money and breathing fire. A second version, directed by Lee Baker, was released very late in 1995, just before \"How Bizarre\" went to number one in New Zealand. Shot on a soundstage in Ponsonby and at Ellerslie Racecourse for a budget of $7,000 from NZ On Air, it was shown on US networks about 15,000 times in 1997 and 1998. Besides Pauly, it features backing vocalist Sina Saipaia, and a Filipino man named Hill who stood in for Brother Pele.\nAustralasian and European CD single\n\"How Bizarre\" (radio mix) \u2013 3:49\n\"How Bizarre\" (album mix) \u2013 3:49\n\"How Bizarre\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:49\n\"How Bizarre\" (dance mix) \u2013 6:00\nAustralasian cassette single\n\"How Bizarre\" (radio mix)\n\"How Bizarre\" (album mix)\n\"How Bizarre\" (instrumental)\nUK 12-inch single\nA. \"How Bizarre\" (Sharp Raided mix) \u2013 7:50\nB. \"How Bizarre\" (Flexifinger \"In My Face\" mix) \u2013 8:18\n \nEuropean CD single\u2014cardboard sleeve\n\"How Bizarre\" (radio mix) \u2013 3:49\n\"How Bizarre\" (dance mix) \u2013 6:00\nUS promo CD\n\"How Bizarre\" \u2013 3:43\nJapanese CD single\n\"How Bizarre\" (radio mix)\n\"How Bizarre\" (album mix)\n\"How Bizarre\" (instrumental)\n\"How Bizarre\" (dance mix)\n\"How Bizarre\" (acoustic mix)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1996, a radio personality named Dean Young created a cover of the song called \"Stole My Car\".

It was released on February 11, 2002, in the United States and June 24, 2002, in Australia. The song is a tribute to what Kyle Gass and Jack Black refer to as \"The Best Song in the World\" (often confused as the song's title).\nUpon its release, \"Tribute\" failed to make a commercial impact in the United States, but it became a hit in Australia and New Zealand, peaking at number four on the Australian Singles Chart and number nine on the New Zealand Singles Chart. In Europe, the single charted in the Netherlands, reaching number 25 on the Dutch Top 40, and in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 84 in May 2012. The song is certified Platinum in Australia and Gold in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\n\"Tribute\" was the first song Black and Gass played live as Tenacious D. The song, like many other songs that were recorded on Tenacious D, was originally performed on their short-lived HBO TV series. During earlier performances of this song Kyle Gass played the opening to \"Stairway to Heaven\". The two songs are both in A minor and have very similar chord progressions, and critics have said the songs sound alike.\nThe song chronicles the band members' encounter with a demon who demands the duo play \"the best song in the world\" or have their souls eaten. Having nothing to lose from trying, they play \"the first thing that came to [their] heads\", which \"just so happened to be the best song in the world.\"\nGiven the \"Stairway to Heaven\" interlude in the original TV series version, along with the similarity of the chord progression in both songs, \"Tribute\" at first implies that the best song in the world is indeed that song. However, the lyrics make clear that \"Tribute\" sounds nothing like the song they came up with to please the demon; as Black describes: \"And the peculiar thing is this, my friends: The song we sang on that fateful night \u2014 it didn't actually sound anything like this song.\"\nIn an interview, the band claimed that the inspiration from the song came after Jack Black played Metallica's \"One\" for Kyle Gass, describing it as \"the best song in the world\", leading to a failed attempt to themselves write an even better song, and a discussion of the meaninglessness of labeling any song that way. \"Tribute\" was written as a paean to the impossibility of reaching musical perfection, making the claim that the greatest song in the world had in fact been theirs, but that they had forgotten it.\nIn Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, it is implied that the climax of the movie, a rock-off challenge between Satan and Tenacious D told through the song \"Beelzeboss (The Final Showdown)\", is the incident chronicled in \"Tribute\", and that the portion of \"Beelzeboss\" performed by Tenacious D is the song receiving tribute. After defeating Satan, Jack and Kyle recall the incident once more, describing it as, \"the greatest song in the world\". Unfortunately, they are unable to remember how it went. Also in the song \"Beelzeboss\", they mention that they know the demon's weakness, referred to as their \"Rock-It Sauce\", which is what they use in their HBO television series to defeat the demon. However, unlike the demon in the television episode, Satan says they are \"Fuckin' lame\" and tries to take Kyle Gass to hell after all, while the demon asks if they are angels. However, considering that they do not remember the song, they may have forgotten this as well. This was confirmed in a commentary with Jack Black for the movie.\nThe music video for \"Tribute\", directed and edited by Liam Lynch, features Jack Black and Kyle Gass, in a cheap shopping mall karaoke booth, rewired to record their song.\nAs they sing, the video cuts between footage of the pair walking down the \"long, lonesome road\" and the encounter with the demon played by Dave Grohl. The demon also performs the electric guitar solo in the music video.  After the solo, Black and Gass jump out of the booth and start shouting the lyrics at mall shoppers and dancing flamboyantly. Passersby include cameos from Lynch and Ben Stiller. While most pay no attention, an old lady, played by Linda Porter, assaults Black with her purse after he grabs her while singing. A policeman, played by JR Reed, who played \"Lee\" in the band's television series, takes Black and Gass away. At the end, the same old lady who was frightened by the duo picks up the now-recorded CD, eyes glowing red, and cackles demonically.\nAlthough the video had huge success on UK television, the song was never actually released there as"

It is the third track on their fifth studio album, The Joshua Tree (1987), and was released as the album's lead single on 16 March 1987. The song was the group's most successful single at the time, becoming their first number-one hit in both the United States and Canada by topping the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks and the RPM national singles chart for one week, with a further three weeks at number two.\n\"With or Without You\" features sustained guitar parts played by guitarist the Edge with a prototype of the Infinite Guitar, along with vocals by lead singer Bono and a bassline by bassist Adam Clayton. The song originated from a demo recorded in late 1985 that the group continued to work on throughout The Joshua Tree sessions. Ostensibly a troubled love song, the track's lyrics were inspired by Bono's conflicting feelings about the lives he led as a musician and domestic man.\nCritics praised the song upon its release. It is frequently performed on the band's tours, and it has appeared on many of their compilation albums and concert films. \"With or Without You\" is U2's second most frequently covered song. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song 131st on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\nIn late 1985, U2 convened at a house that drummer Larry Mullen Jr. bought to review material the group had written during The Unforgettable Fire Tour. During this time, a rough demo of \"With or Without You\" was written, with lead vocalist Bono composing the song's chord sequence. The band continued to work on the song at STS Studios, creating many permutations of the track, but not making any progress. Guitarist the Edge considered the song at that point to be \"awful\". The track consisted of a Yamaha drum machine beat and a bass part played by bassist Adam Clayton using an Ibanez bass guitar with a short scale. According to Clayton, these early versions of the song sounded too sentimental and \"very traditional because the chords just went round and round and round\".\nThe sessions for The Joshua Tree started in earnest in 1986, and U2 were recording at the Georgian mansion Danesmoate House in Dublin. The group attempted to take the song in a different direction, although Bono was reluctant. Under the direction of co-producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, the Edge pursued more ambient guitar playing, Clayton turned up the volume on his bass, and Mullen experimented with an electronically enhanced drum kit. Despite the work they continued to put into the track, the group considered abandoning the song, as they could not find an arrangement they liked.\nBono and his friend Gavin Friday continued to work on the song after Lanois and Eno declined to do so. Bono credits Friday with rescuing the song and rearranging it, believing it could be a hit. Eno added a keyboard arpeggio, similar to the one from \"Bad\". The song's fate was still in doubt when the Edge was sent a prototype of the Infinite Guitar by Canadian musician Michael Brook, with whom he had collaborated for the Captive soundtrack. The instrument allowed sustained notes to be played, producing \"a similar effect to the E-Bow\", but with the ability to provide all the \"mid-points between no sustain and infinite sustain\" that the E-Bow cannot provide. The prototype included elaborate assembly instructions and as the Edge recollects, \"one wrongly placed wire and you could get a nasty belt of electricity. This piece of gear would have failed even the most basic of safety regulations.\" On subsequent tours, his guitar technician occasionally received electric shocks from the instrument when preparing it for performances.\nListening to the backing track to \"With or Without You\" in the control room, Bono and Friday heard the sustained effect that the Edge was creating with the Infinite Guitar in the other room. The combination of the two playing simultaneously caught their attention. According to Lanois, \"I said, 'That sounded pretty cool,' so we listened back and I said, 'Jesus, it's better than I thought.'\" The Edge immediately recorded an Infinite Guitar part in two takes. The band considers the song's recording to be one of the album sessions' breakthrough moments, as it was recorded amidst concerns that they had run out of ideas.\nEno sequenced the song's"

Written by Lights in collaboration with songwriter-producer Tawgs Salter, the song was released July 22, 2014 via LIGHTS Music as the lead single from the album. In the United States, it was released to modern rock radio through Warner Bros. Records on September 9, 2014.\nThe song has enjoyed commercial success - it reached number 31 on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 and the top ten on multiple airplay formats, and was certified Gold by Music Canada in January 2015 - and was also met with positive reviews from contemporary music critics, being described as \"impossibly catchy.\"\n\"Up We Go\" is a synthpop song that combines Lights' signature electro-influenced pop production style with \"lush\" guitars. Jeff Benjamin of fuse described the style as a compromise between the lighter synths of her debut and the grittier electropop territory explored on Siberia. Lyrically, the song is an anthem about persevering through difficult times, with the chorus assuring the listener that \"from down this low / It's only up we go\".\nThe song received mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. In his \"Song of the Day\" spotlight featuring \"Up We Go\", Jeff Benjamin of fuse praised Lights for \"[mixing] clever lyrics... with inspiring lyrics about persevering and looking forward to the brighter day\" and was also complimentary of the shift in her sound. Also praising the lighter musical approach, Greg Moskovitch of Music Feeds wrote that \"[t]he punchy, synth-pop production provides a soaring and glittering soundbed for Poxleitner\u2019s motivational lyrics, which lead into an anthemic, impossibly catchy chorus.\" British music blog Popjustice rated the song 8/10 and felt the song had the potential to elevate Lights's career to the next level: \"Canadian electronic pop expert Lights hasn't yet enjoyed the UK success she deserves... which is a shame, because if this excellent first track from her new album 'Little Machines' is anything to go by she's about to scale new heights.\"\n\"Up We Go\" debuted at number 84 on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 for the chart dated August 9, 2014. On the chart dated November 8, 2014, \"Up We Go\" reached a new peak of number 31, becoming her second highest-charting single yet, behind \"Drive My Soul\", which peaked at number 18. It debuted at number 42 on Canada CHR/Top 40 on the chart issued September 13, 2014, as well as number 47 on Canada Hot AC and number 43 on Canada AC the following week. The song has since peaked in the top 10 on the former two, and the top 5 on the latter.\nThe official music video for \"Up We Go\" was directed by Alon Isocianu and premiered on Lights's VEVO channel on September 3, 2014. The one shot video features the singer in an elevator, with various background events and characters appearing as the doors open to new locations.\nThe song \"Up We Go\" also features in the soundtrack and ingame songs of EA's The Sims 4.

It was written and produced by longtime contributor Missy Elliott with additional penning from Jazmine Sullivan, Cainon \"Lambo\" Lamb, and Anthony \"J.R. Smashh\" Randolph for Monica's seventh studio album, New Life (2012), sampling both The Spinners' 1975 record \"I Don't Want to Lose You\" and Boogie Down Productions' 1987 song \"9mm Goes Bang\". A soulful, anthemic R&B ballad built upon percussion with piano chords, the song lyrically explores the breakdown of an old relationship.\nThe track was serviced to digital media stores on September 27, 2011 in the United States, replacing \"Anything (To Find You)\"  featuring Rick Ross as the album's initial leading single. Released to mixed reviews by contemporary music critics, who praised its more sophisticated and melodically complex structure but felt it formulaic, it failed to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100, but peaked at number 22 on the component Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. While it would remain the highest-charting single offering from the New Life album, it was later demoted and replaced by Rico Love-produced \"It All Belongs to Me\", a duet with R&B singer Brandy, as the album's leading single.\nThe music video for \"Until It's Gone\" was shot by director Diane Martel and filmed in the Harlem neighborhood, New York City on October 3, 2011. It premiered online on October 24, 2011 to coincide with Monica's thirty-first birthday. American actor Brian J. White and actress Malinda Williams star in the video, which centers on two characters having words in their automobile, leading to a devastating accident.\n\"Until It's Gone\" was written and produced by Missy Elliott, Cainon Lamb, and Jazmine Sullivan, all of which had contributed to Monica's previous singles \"Everything to Me\" and \"Anything (To Find You),\" with additional writing by Anthony Randolph. It contains elements of both The Spinners' 1975 record \"I Don't Want to Lose You,\" penned by Thomas Bell and Linda Epstein, and Boogie Down Productions' 1987 song \"9mm Goes Bang\", written by band members Lawrence \"KRS-One\" Parker, and Scott \"La Rock\" Sterling. Production on the track was handled by Elliott and Lamb. While most of the music was sampled from the two songs mentioned above, Anthony \"J.R. Smashh\" Randolph played additional keyboards. Manny Marroquin mixed the track with assistance by Erik Madrid and Chris Galland, while Miguel \"Pro\" Castro assisted in the audio engineering of \"Until It's Gone\"; both tasks were executed at the Larrabee Sound Studio, in Universal City, California. Speaking about what motivated her to record the song, Monica said: \"When it came to 'Until It's Gone,' I probably was just sharing,\" she said. \"I was already in a sharing mood.\"\n\"Until It's Gone\" received generally mixed to positive reviews by music critics. AllMusic editor Matt Collar called the song an \"anthemic ballad\", benefiting from Elliott's \"slick but straightforward productions that mix a deft synth and drum program studio vibe with a warm, overall earthy vibe.\" Mark Edward Nero from About.com felt that \"Until It's Gone\" gave \"a few hints where Monica might be headed\", and added: \"The song, which has a strong piano-based melody, is a lot more sophisticated and melodically complex than anything she recorded during her The Boy is Mine days in the '90s\".  Music blog DJBooth.net remarked that the \"heart-wrenching ballad finds heavyweight femcee Missy Elliott and co-producer Lamb once again working their magic behind the boards. Pairing reverb-drenched percussion with delicate piano chords, the collaborators craft an appropriately poignant backdrop for Monica\u2019s soulful (and rather blunt) entreaties.\" Bianca Roach, writer for news agency Associated Press, felt that \"sophisticated killer ballad \"Until It's Gone\" is proof Monica hasn't lost that golden voice.\" She remarked that \"the raw pain in her voice hits home to give you goosebumps all over\".\nThatGrapeJuice.net felt that the song was sticking to her tried-and-true formula of previous midtempo singles \"So Gone\" and \"Everything to Me\" and wrote that it \"showcases the Monica fans have grown to know and love \u2013 sass, simplicity, and heartfelt vocal delivery.\" In her track-by-track review of New Life, Billboard magazine writer Erika Ramirez noted, \"the 'You Don't Know What You Got Till It's Gone' anthem is laced with The Spinners \"I Don't Want to Lose You\" and Boogie Down Productions' \"9 MM Goes Bang.\" The cut stands the best chance of breaking out amid the"

It was released through Keep Cool and RCA Records on July 16, 2021, as the lead single from Normani's upcoming debut solo album. The song marks her first radio single since 2019's \"Motivation\". It was written by the two artists alongside Keynon Moore, Pardison Fontaine, Starrah, Dave Cappa, Jonah Christian, June Nawakii, Taylor Ross, and Tyler Rohn, and was produced by the latter six and Normani.\n\"Wild Side\" received critical acclaim upon release, with praise for the song's vocals and production. It was released alongside a music video directed by Tanu Muino, who also directed Cardi B's \"Up\"; and was choreographed by Sean Bankhead, who also choreographed Normani's \"Motivation\". The song contains an interpolation of the 1996 Aaliyah single \"One in a Million\". \"Wild Side\" debuted at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, It also reached number-one on the R&B Streaming Songs and the R&B Digital Song Sales chart. The song received a MTV Video Music Award for Song of Summer nomination.\nNormani went on a two year hiatus from music after the release of the single \"Motivation\", in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of her mother's breast cancer. During that time period her mother encouraged her to focus on her career and making new music, in the process \"Wild Side\" was created.   Normani posted a snippet\u00a0of \"Wild Side\" to her social media on February 5, 2021, with the caption, \"know it's been awhile\". Cardi B heard the snippet and later joined \"Wild Side\" according to the singer, with Normani stating \"I knew I wanted to do something with her, but I was already in rehearsal for three weeks for the music video. We had already been in rehearsal, and I called her stylist because he's also my stylist, and I was like, 'Yo, like, we gotta figure something out. Like this link-up has to happen. There's no other way. It just has to happen, there's no option. 'And he was like, 'Actually, she mentioned \"Wild Side\", She was like, \"Is it that \"Wild Side\" song? Is it the \"Wild Side\" song?\"' Because I had posted the clip like two months ago\".\nAfter speculation of a collaboration between the two, Normani archived all but one post on her Instagram page on July 12, 2021, hinting at a possible relevant announcement. The following day, Cardi B stated that she had \"a little secret\" to tell her audience the following day. On July 14, Normani confirmed the title, release date and cover art of the collaborative single on her respective social media pages. Both performers had interacted in the past multiple times, with Normani making a special appearance in the music video for \"WAP\" by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion in August 2020 alongside other singers and personalities like Kylie Jenner and Rosal\u00eda.\n\"Wild Side\" received critical acclaim upon its release. MTV News praised Normani's vocal performance, stating that she \"delivers her silky verses with serenity and precision, sizzling with temptation and allure with every breath. She never leaves a moment unmilked; her voice masterfully floats along the song's subtle yet thumping production \u2013 sampling fellow R&B goddess Aaliyah's 1996 hit 'One In A Million'\", and praised Cardi B's rapping on the song, noting that she \"slides in with ease.\" For Pitchfork, Vrinda Jagota called it \"a sultry R&B showstopper\", adding, \"If 'Motivation' was Normani's jubilant breakthrough, 'Wild Side' is the meticulously crafted showpiece that proves she's here to stay.\" For USA Today, Rasha Ali deemed it \"a steamy, sensual slow jam.\"\nIn August 2021, Billboard placed the single on their 15 Best Aaliyah Samples in Modern R&B/Hip-Hop list.\n\nIn the United States, \"Wild Side\" debuted at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Normani's third top 20 solo hit, and Cardi B's 16th; while becoming Normani's highest debuting song to date.

It was released in November 20, 2000 as the third single from Eminem's third album, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000). It reached number one in 12 countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, and Australia.\nThe 45 King-produced track also uses a slightly modified break from \"Thank You\" as its base sample; both songs were released as singles in late 2000. \"Stan\" has been called one of Eminem's best songs and is considered one of his signature songs. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Stan\" 296th on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, upping their ranking to 223rd in a 2021 updated list. The song was also listed 15th on VH1's list of the greatest hiphop songs of all time and named in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\nThe song was nominated for multiple awards, including Best Song at the MTV Europe Music Awards, Video of the Year, Best Rap Video, Best Direction, and Best Cinematography at the MTV Video Music Awards. It won Best International Artist Video at the MuchMusic Video Awards. In April 2011, Complex magazine put together a list of the 100 greatest Eminem songs and ranked \"Stan\" second. The eponymous character's name gave rise to a slang term that refers to overzealous, maniacal, overly obsessed, entitled fans of a celebrity or personality; the term has since been included in the Oxford English Dictionary.\nThe song tells the story of a person named Stanley \"Stan\" Mitchell (voiced by Eminem) who claims to be Eminem's biggest fan. He writes Eminem several letters; over three verses, he becomes more obsessive, and when there is no reply he becomes angrier. He finally creates a voice recording of himself while driving his car on the highway, having consumed large quantities of depressants and alcohol; this verse includes a call-back to Eminem's \"My Name Is\" with the lyrics \"I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?\" He reveals that his pregnant girlfriend is tied up in the trunk as he approaches a bridge, and realizes just before driving off it that he has no way to send the tape to Eminem.\nThe fourth verse features Eminem as himself, writing back to Stan and attempting to reason with him. He warns Stan that he should get help, telling him about a story he heard on the news about a man who had driven his car off a bridge in a drunken stupor, killing himself and his pregnant girlfriend. Eminem then comes to the realization that this man was actually Stan.\nDirected by Dr. Dre and Philip Atwell, the video is a literal interpretation of the story. The video features Devon Sawa as Stan and Dido as his pregnant girlfriend. A prologue involves Stan dyeing his hair blonde and reacting angrily to being called \"Stanley\" by his girlfriend. Later, he sits in a basement full of Eminem's posters, writing letters that express his devotion as \"your [Eminem's] biggest fan\". He is aware of every development in Eminem's personal life.\nStan wants Eminem to contact him through a personal letter or a phone call; but, due to unfortunate circumstances, the letters fail to reach Eminem in a timely manner. Believing he has been ignored, Stan uses a tape recorder to record himself driving along a rain-soaked highway while his girlfriend is locked up in the trunk; which he does with the intention of driving off a bridge. In the process, Stan references both \"My Name Is\" (\"I drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?\") and an urban legend about Phil Collins's \"In the Air Tonight\" before realizing that there is no way of transmitting this final tape to Eminem. The car then breaks through the bridge barrier, sealing both occupants' fates.\nStan's mother and his little brother Matthew visit his grave. When Matthew opens his hoodie, he has dyed his hair blonde like Stan. Eminem finally gets around to responding to Stan. He apologizes for being late, thanks him for being a fan, and expresses interest in Stan's personal life. Eminem worries about Stan's mental state and says he does not want Stan to end up like a story he had seen on the news recently\u2014a man who had driven drunk off a bridge with his girlfriend in the trunk, about whom he then realizes, \"It was you. Damn.\" Unbeknownst to Eminem, flashes of lightning shine on his window, revealing the ghost of Stan silently glaring. The video ends with Matthew staring at"

A downtempo alternative hip hop track combining African folk music elements, the song has a less dance-oriented sound compared to other songs on the album.

The song received widespread acclaim from contemporary critics, who complimented its musical direction and the subversive, unconventional subject matter. It won awards from the Canadian Independent Music Awards and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), and earned a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year.

While M.I.A. wanted to work with American producer Timbaland for Arular's follow-up album Kala (2007), her application for a long-term US work visa was rejected.

It was written and produced by Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg (known collectively as Bloodshy & Avant), with additional writing by Henrik Jonback and Angela Hunte. The song was never intended to be released as a single; Spears, however, wanted to shoot a music video for it, and had to convince her record company. It was then released on January 19, 2005, by Jive Records as the second single from the album outside North America. The dance-pop song features usage of electric guitars, and its lyrics allude to having a good time and not caring about other people's judgement.\n\"Do Somethin'\" received generally favorable reviews from critics, and received comparisons to Gwen Stefani's 2004 single \"What You Waiting For?\". Although the single was not released in the United States, it charted on many of Billboard's component charts due to digital downloads, managing to reach number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was also successful worldwide, reaching top ten positions in countries such as Australia, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. By the end of 2005, \"Do Somethin'\" was one of the best-selling singles in Australia and Belgium that year.\nSpears pushed Jive Records to allow her to shoot an accompanying music video for the song. The music video was co-directed by Billie Woodruff and Spears (who makes her directorial debut), and is credited as her alter ego \"Mona Lisa\", a reference to her alter ego from the song of the same name and from the scrapped Original Doll album. It portrays the singer and four female friends dancing and performing in a nightclub. Spears styled the video and came up with the choreography. The usage of a Louis Vuitton dashboard in the video resulted in a lawsuit against Jive Records in late 2007, which ended with Louis Vuitton winning \u20ac80,000 in damages. The video was also banned in all European TV channels. Spears performed \"Do Somethin'\" during The M+M's Tour in 2007, The Circus Starring Britney Spears in 2009 and Britney: Piece of Me in 2013\u201317.\nOn August 13, 2004, Spears announced through Jive Records the release of her first greatest hits compilation titled Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, due November 16, 2004. The title was chosen after the album's lead single, Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's 1988 single \"My Prerogative\". The cover was produced by Swedish production team Bloodshy & Avant, who produced her single \"Toxic\" from her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). A DVD of the same name was also released the same day, containing Spears's music videos. The track list was officially revealed on September 13, 2004. Greatest Hits: My Prerogative included three new tracks: \"My Prerogative\", \"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\" and \"Do Somethin'\", all of them produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The producers recorded and arranged the main instrumentation of \"Do Somethin'\" at Murlyn Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden. Spears recorded her vocals at Battery Studios in New York City during The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004. Background vocals were provided by Spears, Angela Hunte, BlackCell and Emma Holmgren. The song was never planned to be released as a single. However, Spears wanted to shoot a music video for the song and had to fight with her record label to do it. She explained she was \"a little disappointed\" that she had to convince them \"that making this video was the right thing to do at th[e] time\". \"Do Somethin'\" was released as the second single from Greatest Hits: My Prerogative on February 14, 2005.\n\"Do Somethin'\" is a dance-pop song with usage of electric guitars and a \"bump beat\", as described by Spence D. of IGN. He also noted the song is \"filled with faux string bursts and mock-'70s synth gurgle (think Zapp/Gap Band era) and plenty of treated guitar and bass\". According to the sheetmusic published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, it is set at a moderately fast tempo with 130 beats per minute. The song is written in"

Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Autumn Rowe, Petr Brdi\u010dko. \"Happiness\" is the debut single by American singer and 2006 America's Got Talent contestant Alexis Jordan. It is the lead single from her self-titled debut studio album, released in the United States on September 7, 2010. The upbeat dance-pop and house rhythm behind the track was heavily sampled from electronic artist deadmau5's \"Brazil (2nd Edit)\" (released two years prior to \"Happiness\"). The lyrics were written by Autumn Rowe and Petr Brdi\u010dko, and the track was re-edited for the lyrics by Stargate.\n\"Happiness\" was generally well received by many critics, with some complimenting Jordan's vocal abilities. In the United States, the song topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, giving Jordan her first number one on the chart. It reached number 1 in the charts in the Netherlands (staying there for 10 weeks and eventually becoming the best song of 2011 in this chart) and has also charted in the top five in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia. An accompanying music video, directed by Aggressive, sees Jordan being torn apart from her love interest. It was noted for its similarities to Kylie Minogue's \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\". The Dave Aud\u00e9 Club Mix was the official song of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany.\nAfter being eliminated from the first season of America's Got Talent in 2006, Jordan began posting videos of herself singing cover songs on YouTube, of which she later became a viral sensation for. After receiving a phone call from Stargate, Jordan flew over to New York City to record a few songs with them. It was then announced in the press in March 2010 that she had signed to StarRoc/Roc Nation after Jay-Z had noticed her in the studio with Stargate.\n\"Happiness\" is an upbeat dance-pop song, influenced by house music. The song has a \"simple, pleasant melody\" and has been described as an \"upbeat track tinged with full good electronica\". The music used was deadmau5's \"Brazil (2nd Edit)\", which was re-edited for the vocals by Stargate. In explaining the song, Jordan revealed it is about \"finding love in yourself before you find it in someone else, because a lot of people lose themselves when they fall in love, and they forget who they are, and that's what you've gotta do. You've gotta find someone who loves you for you\". Songwriter Autumn Rowe has said in an interview that \"Happiness\" has an African influence.\nFraser McAlpine of BBC Music awarded the song four stars and said \"If Madonna had put this out, it would be hailed as one of the best songs of her long and varied career. And she possibly would struggle to get the crystal purity of those top notes, which means Alexis is officially better than Madonna\". Bill Lamb of About.com praised the song for its \"danceable beat\" and \"simple, pleasant melody\" but also called the song an \"insubstantial fluff\" and that its \"sound lacks any particular distinction\". Kevin O'Donnell of NPR Music called the song an \"irresistible pop anthem\" and said \"this is disco music for a Disney audience \u2014 and, amazingly enough, it works\".\nNick Levine of Digital Spy awarded the song five stars, describing the song as a \"tale of romantic regret, realisation and ultimately exultation\". Andrew Butler of Pink Paper magazine was impressed with the song, stating \"It really does make you feel happy, through a mixture of its fabulously put together lyrics, infectious humming and danceable tunes\". Emma Johnson of Liverpool Echo called the song \"one of the most infectious tracks of the year\", while AOL Radio named it the sixth top dance song of 2010.\nIn the United States, \"Happiness\" debuted on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart at number 40. It climbed the chart in subsequent weeks and peaked at the top position for the week, July 17, 2010. The song held the position for one week before losing it to Wynter Gordon's \"Dirty Talk\". Also in the US, the song reached number one on the Hot Dance Airplay chart. In the United Kingdom, the song debuted, and peaked, at #3 for the week ending November 13, 2010. It made its Irish debut at number 31 and spent 20 weeks inside the top 50. and peaked at number thirty-one. On the European Hot 100 Singles chart, \"Happiness\" reached number 13. In Australia, the song debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at number 25 on December 19, 2010, before peaking at number three in its sixth week on the chart. It has since been certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for sales of 210,000 units. In April 2011, the song reached number one for ten weeks in the Dutch Top 40 and"

The band wrote the song and co-produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson for their debut album, Parachutes (2000). The song was recorded in March 2000 and released on 26 June that same year as the second UK single from Parachutes, following \"Shiver\", and as the lead single in the United States.\n\"Yellow\" reached number four on the UK Singles Chart, giving Coldplay their first top-five hit in the United Kingdom. It was Coldplay's breakthrough hit internationally, reaching number one in Iceland, number five in Australia, number nine in Ireland and number 48 in the United States. Helped by heavy rotation and usage in advertising, the song thrust the band into popularity. \"Yellow\" has since been covered by various recording artists worldwide, and remains one of the band's most popular songs.\n\"Yellow\" was written in Rockfield's Quadrangle studio near Monmouth in South Wales, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after finishing recording \"Shiver\", the band took a break and went out of the studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and \"just amazing\", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously and sang the tune to the rest of the band in \"his worst Neil Young impersonation voice\". Martin has said, \"The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice.\" The melody \"started off a lot slower\", according to drummer Will Champion, and it sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, \"and it sort of got a bit heavier\".\nWhile composing the song's lyrics, Martin could not find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing keyword in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He looked around the studio and saw the Yellow Pages. The lyrics progressed from there, with the band collaborating. Bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line \"Look at the stars\". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.\nOn The Howard Stern Show in November 2011, Chris Martin explained to Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck with him for a bit; then in a Neil Young voice he sang \"look at the stars\". Martin went on to further explain that the word \"yellow\" has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change \"yellow\" to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word \"yellow\" just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just to move on to the next question. Martin applauded Stern saying \"I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'.\"\nThe band and Nelson produced the track. Nelson was acquainted with the band's music through the former's manager. Nelson's manager gave him a copy of an EP and single by Coldplay, and showed interest in working with them after seeing the band perform live. \"Yellow\" was initially recorded upstairs in the project studio, basically a demo room in Liverpool's Parr Street Studios. The track was later mixed in New York City.\nNelson and the band encountered problems in producing some aspects of the song. According to Champion, \"...\u00a0it was really difficult to record because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging...\" The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, \"because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove\". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the"

It was written by LaShawn Daniels, Rodney Jerkins, Fred Jerkins III, Isaac Phillips, Toni Estes, and produced by Darkchild. The song examines a woman confronting her lover about his infidelity. Houston won the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for this song. In 2003, Q Magazine ranked \"It's Not Right but It's Okay\" at number 638 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\". The single reached number one in Spain and the top five in Canada, Iceland, The United Kingdom, and The United States.\nThe original Rodney Jerkins production was released, but mainstream radio airplay and sales were given for the Thunderpuss Remix. The remixed version was released on Houston's 2000 Whitney: The Greatest Hits collection, and the original album version appears on 2007's The Ultimate Collection.\nThe Johnny Vicious remixes were included on the domestic CD maxi-single of \"Heartbreak Hotel\" as well as the on the import single and are currently available as iTunes downloads. The KCC remix was included on the US version of the \"My Love Is Your Love\" maxi-single and is also available as an iTunes download. Rodney Jerkins' remixes are the closest to the album version; Club 69 (Peter Rauhofer) also remixed the track for play in the UK. In the US, when it was released as a stand-alone single, the versions that appear are the Rodney Jerkins, Thunderpuss, and Club 69 remixes. There is also a ballad version, entitled \"Smooth Mix\".\n\"It's Not Right but It's Okay\" is a R&B neo soul song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is written in the key of C minor with a tempo of 130 beats per minute. Houston's vocals span from G\u2083 to A\u266d\u2085 in the song.\nBill Lamb from About.com noted that the song is a \"hard-hitting anthem for women on the way out of relationships that sounds great on the radio and on the dance floor.\" J.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun wrote, \"So when we hear her telling her abusive, less-than-faithful lover off in \"It's Not Right But It's Okay\", we're not to imagine the lyrics have anything to do with the rumored infidelity of her real-life husband, Bobby Brown.\" Billboard magazine highlighted the song on Houston's album. Birmingham Evening Mail commented, \"Houston, we have a problem. We loved your leather-limbed performance on the Brits of Rodney Jenkins' standout track from your new album 'My Love Is Your Love' and we know you should be cutting contemporary R&B - we just reckon you deserve better songs. Still, as a chart cert this'll do nicely, it's not great but it's okay.\" Matt Stopera and Brian Galindo from BuzzFeed noted on the Thunderpuss Remix, that \"aside from being a essential gay dance floor classic, this track proves how a good remix can elevate a song from good to ICONIC.\" Daily Record stated, \"Soul diva Whitney sounds streetwise with her biggest single since I Will Always Love You.\"\nIt became the album's third single and peaked at No. 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on July 3, 1999. The single also peaked at number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, No. 7 on the top 100 Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart, and was certified Gold by the RIAA. The song reached No. 3 in Canada, Iceland and the United Kingdom \u2014 in March 1999, where it stayed in the chart for 15 weeks, becoming a hugely popular radio hit in the country.

It was written by Static Major, Eric Seats and Rapture Stewart. Despite Aaliyah initially starting promotion for the expected second single \"More Than a Woman\", Blackground Records and Virgin Records posthumously serviced \"Rock the Boat\" to urban adult contemporary radio as the second single from Aaliyah on September 25, 2001.\n\"Rock the Boat\" peaked at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100 dated January 5, 2002. The song stayed on the chart for 25 weeks. It was nominated for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\"Rock the Boat\" came into fruition almost by accident, because producer Eric Seats almost deleted the song's file. The file nearly got deleted because Seats didn't like what he heard right away. Seats explained, \"I almost deleted 'Rock The Boat' because I'm the kind of guy that once I start producing a track and I don't feel it right away sometimes, I would delete it and just start something over fresh.\" The song was saved when songwriter Static Major heard the instrumental of the song through headphones and quickly wrote the hook for the song.\nAccording to Seats. \"Static heard it through my headphones. I took a break and went to the restroom, and by the time I got back he had already written a hook.\" When discussing the fate of the song, he then proceeded to say, \"I wouldn't say it was an accident, but we weren't vibing with it as much. It was one of those things like if he had came 10 minutes later, he probably would've never heard it.\" During the early stages of the song \"it was very raw\" and since Static Major showed strong interest in the song, Seats continued to develop the song. Seats mentioned, \"Since he had an interest in it, I said, 'Let me go and continue building on it, let me embellish it, make something happen since you're feeling it.' We didn't know it was going to end up being 'Rock The Boat'.\" Seats \"beefed\" up the development process of the track by calling Dave Foreman and Rapture Stewart to add a guitar and strings to the songs instrumental.\nOriginally, \"More than A Woman\" was chosen as the second single from Aaliyah's self titled album, but due to heavy radio airplay \"Rock the Boat\" became the second single. According to producer Rapture Stewart, \"The only reason they shot 'Rock the Boat' was because the radio was already playing it, so that kind of forced it to be the second single (instead of 'More Than a Woman').\" Although \"Rock the Boat\" received heavy radio airplay, Aaliyah's label didn't want the song to be released as a single. Instead, the label felt that songs produced by Timbaland should have been released as singles because \"that was her sound at the time\", according to Stewart. Aaliyah, who loved \"Rock the Boat\", fought with her label and pushed for the song to become the album's second single. Seats recalled hearing Aaliyah say, \"No, it's this one. I don't care who did what. This one is the next one,\" during an argument.\n\"Rock the Boat\" is described as being a Caribbean-flavored sensual and smooth mid-tempo song. The song features an atmospheric groove, hypnotic rhythms, and fluctuating instrumentation such as synthesizer effects. Michael Odell from the British publication The Guardian felt that \"Rock the Boat\" pays tribute to synth-driven 1980s soul\". On the song, \"Aaliyah's tentative vocal finds its way around a menu of high-octane sexual requests,\" according to reviewer Michael Odell of The Guardian. Lyrically, its female narrator instructs a lover on how to please her sexually and equates her erotic high to a drug high: \"Work the middle / Change positions / Now stroke it for me /  ... I feel like I'm on dope / Explore my body /.\" Nateleg\u00e9 Whaley of Mic opined that \"she is captain of her physical needs in the bedroom and confidently directs the voyage. She knew what she wanted and knew how to get it.\" According to producer Bud'da, Aaliyah debated about if the song should include the line \"Feels like I'm on dope\" because she didn't want to send the wrong message to her fans about drugs.\nKhal from Complex felt that the video for the song matched the laid-back vibe of the instrumental. According to Khal, \"The end result was a thing of beauty, with tropical visuals properly matching the laid back vibe of the instrumental. Perfect percussive accents dwell around the chilled melodies.\" James Poletti from dotmusic felt that Aaliyah's \"breathy vocals become stutteringly"

A Decade of Song, released on 1 November 1999. It peaked within the top ten in many countries, like Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. Billboard listed it as one of the Greatest Songs of 1999.\nIt was written and produced by Swedish producers Andreas Carlsson, Max Martin and Kristian Lundin, who had written a string of hit songs for artists such as NSYNC, Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears.\n\"That's the Way It Is\" starts out in the key of E major with a moderate tempo of 93 beats per minute.  Throughout the verses, the song follows a chord progression of C\u266fm\u2013A\u2013B, and Dion's vocals span from B\u2083 to E\u2085.\nThe song has a bridge, and after the bridge is the chorus repeated, only in the key of A major.\nDion sang it live with NSYNC, during her 1999 CBS Special. She also performed \"That's the Way It Is\" on Top of the Pops on 12 November, the 1999 Billboard Music Awards, the Bambi Awards on 11 December, The Rosie O'Donnell Show on 13 December, The Today Show on 31 December, and on the Let's Talk About Love Tour as the closing song.\nWhen Dion returned to the music scene after her 2 years off in 2002, the song was performed on her promotional tour for the A New Day Has Come album including a second time at The Today Show, The Early Show, and at the concert for World Children's Day.\nIn 2015 for the first time in 13 years, Dion added the song as an acoustic version and later the full length version in her 2nd Las Vegas residency show Celine at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. The song was also performed in Dion's 2017 European tour and her 2018 tour. \"That's the Way it is\" was performed by Dion during her BST Hyde Park concert in London on 5 July 2019. The song is also featured on the Courage World Tour in North America.\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that the danceable \"That's the Way It Is\" works and highlighted it as a standout on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Another editor, Jose F. Promis reviewed the US/South Korea CD maxi single and rated it 3 out 5 stars. He called the song itself a \"cheerful pop nugget\", the album version a \"definitive hit\", and the \"Metro Club Remix\" a \"bubbly dance\" version of the song. Michael Paoletta from Billboard highlighted it on the album, and called it a \"welcome uptempo number\". Another editor, Chuck Taylor also praised \"That's the Way It Is\". He wrote that Dion at last \"ups the tempo with the irresistible\" first single. According to Taylor, this new track, a joyful ode to holding the faith but allowing love to take its course when it's ready, matches Dion with a new team of collaborators, consistent hitmakers: Max Martin, Kristian Lundin and Andreas Carlsson. \"Replete with a festive mandolin and a midtempo beat to bring new heights to her as-ever splendid vocal,\" this song is \"destined to enrapture\" top forty and AC the first time through, at last stripping away mainstream radio's gripe that Dion is \"too adult\". He said that, youthful and yet elegant, and glowing brightly with warmth, the song also represents a bold step forward for Martin, who is best known for his work with chart-topping youth acts. All in all, \"That's the Way It Is\" is \"one of the most compelling radio releases yet\" from \"one of the core voices of the decade.\" Can't Stop the Pop stated that the song \"doesn't sound like it's trying to be Britney Spears; it sounds like the authentic evolution of a superstar \u2013 this is a Celine Dion song through and through \u2013 and it's hard to imagine it being performed by anyone else\".\nThe song became a hit, going to number 1 on the adult contemporary charts in Canada and the United States, reaching the top ten in other countries all over the world. It was Dion's first airplay-only single that charted on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 6 (number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay). The commercial single was released nine months later as a double A-side with \"I Want You to Need Me\", reaching number 62 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales.\nIt ranked at number 12 on decade-end list of US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart for 2000\u20132009. The song spent 1 week at number 1 at the top and an eventual 85 weeks or 1 and a half years on the said chart. It became one of the longest-running single in"

It was first released on 7 October 1998 in Italy by Bliss Corporation and became internationally successful the following year. It is the lead single of their debut album Europop. The song is the group's most popular single, reaching number one in many countries' music charts, such as Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, New Zealand, Israel, Lebanon, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Australia, Austria, Greece, Germany, and Hungary, as well as reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in January 2000.\nIn the United Kingdom, the song initially entered the top 40 purely on import sales; it was only the third single to do this. The song also received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 2001 Grammy Awards, two years after it was released.\nWritten by Eiffel 65 lead singer Jeffrey Jey, keyboardist Maurizio Lobina, and producer Massimo Gabutti, \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" was inspired by Lobina's composed opening piano hook. The producers of the song then came up with the idea for a dance song. Jey explained that his inspiration for the lyrics was how a person chooses their lifestyle. The colour blue as the main theme of the song was picked at random, with Lobina telling him to write nonsensical lyrics. Gabutti came up with the \"da ba dee\" hook. The pitch-shifted vocal effect used in the song was created with a harmonizer.\n\"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" is written in the key of G minor, with the vocal range spanning from C\u2083 to E\u266d\u2084, and is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 128 beats per minute.\nThe song's lyrics tell a story about a man who lives in a \"blue world.\" It also explains that he is \"blue inside and outside,\" which, alongside the lyric \"himself and everybody around 'cause he ain't got nobody to listen,\" and \"blue are the feelings that live inside me\" may indicate that the term blue represents his emotional state; however, the song also explains that a vast variety of what he owns is also blue, including his house and his car (\"a blue Corvette\"): different blue-coloured objects are also depicted on the single's cover. The song's hook is the sentence \"I'm blue,\" followed by a repetition of the sounds \"da ba dee da ba die\", which the hook is based around.\nThe song received mixed reviews from critics. Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that \"the hook here, with its dancy but curiously compelling singsongy rhythm and lyric, is destined to react instantly with listeners far and wide.\" He also noted that it has a \"euro sound\", and \"it's creative, it will affect listeners on both ends of the demographic spectrum, and it's anthemic.\" Entertainment Weekly positively reviewed the song, calling the song \"a fleeting, feel-good foot-tapper\" and gave the song a rating of B-. Daily Record said it is the \"strangest-sounding Euro-club hit of the summer\". The Daily Vault's Christopher Thelen described it as a \"quirky little hit\" with a \"bouncy chorus\".

It was released as the lead single from his debut studio album Before the Storm. It was initially released in Finland on 26 October 1999 by 16 Inch Records and was later re-released in many other countries in 2000. The track was uploaded to MP3.com where it gained global recognition. It has also gained recognition for its usage in sports and popularity in internet meme culture.\nOn 1 March 2010, over ten years after its original release, \"Sandstorm\" was certified Gold in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over 500,000 copies. In January 2020, it was certified Platinum for sales over one million.\nOn the centenary of Finland's independence in 2017, celebrations in Helsinki included Darude as one of the main performers with his \"Sandstorm\".\nDarude first started making happy hardcore with a music tracker program on his computer, playing gigs as \"Rudeboy\". He then performed with Wille \"Weirdness\" Heikkil\u00e4 as \"Position 1\", making light Eurodance tunes, and he paired with other DJs on other projects. In September\u2013October 1999 as Darude he began collaborating with Jaakko \"JS16\" Salovaara, known as the producer of the Bomfunk MC's. \"Sandstorm\" was the first product of the collaboration, ready after about a week of work. JS16 signed Darude as the first artist on JS16's new label 16 Inch Records.\nDarude had been uploading various pieces of his trance experimentation on the website MP3.com, where he was building a following, and he also uploaded the full-length demo of \"Sandstorm\". This exposure was responsible for worldwide interest in \"Sandstorm\". In 2000, Darude reported on his mp3.com artist's page that he had \"removed the full-length tracks\" of \"Sandstorm\" at the request of his record company.\nThe title of the instrumental originates from the Roland JP-8080 synthesizer used in the song, which displays the text \"sand storm\" on startup.\nIn a 2016 Reddit AMA interview, Darude admitted that he had never experienced an actual sandstorm but had experienced a dust devil.\n\"Sandstorm\" is an instrumental trance composition. According to Darude, the hardware and software used to make the track are as follows: P2, Cubase VST 32, FastTracker 2, ReBirth, Korg TR-Rack. Then with JS16 in his studio: Cubase on Atari ST1024, Ensoniq ASR-10 sampler, Roland JP8080, NordLead2, Roland JV2080, Ensoniq DP4, Mackie 24/8, Behringer rack compressor.\nThe video for \"Sandstorm\" features Darude with headphones viewing two armed security guards (a man and a woman) chasing a woman with a case. Darude seems to appear at every place where the pursuers and the pursued go. Near the end, the woman with the case stumbles and one of her pursuers (the other woman) betrays her partner, knocking him out. The two women take the case onto a boat with Darude. As of April 2021, the music video uploaded on YouTube via an official channel has garnered over 204 million views.\nThe video was directed by Juuso Syrj\u00e4, a.k.a. Uzi, and was shot in various places in Helsinki, including the Helsinki Cathedral and the Senate Square. It became the first Finnish music video shown on MTV in the US and it received several awards in Finland and on MTV.\n\n\"Sandstorm\" appeared on the pilot episode of popular Showtime series Queer as Folk, which first aired on 3 December 2000. \"Sandstorm\" was also used in the 2001 Finnish film Tango Cabaret (Tango Kabaree). In the third part of the Johnny English film series, Johnny English Strikes Again, the title character played by Rowan Atkinson dances to the beat of \"Sandstorm\" in a dance club scene.\nIn 2009, \"Sandstorm\" was played for the first time at the University of South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium during a Gamecocks football game. While it was actually played by accident during the waning minutes of the Gamecocks' victory over Ole Miss, it has become a rallying anthem for South Carolina fans.\nProfessional wrestler Toru Owashi, mixed martial artist Wanderlei Silva, and baseball pitcher Koji Uehara use \"Sandstorm\" as entrance music. It was also played at the 2006 Winter Olympics, and during the Ice Hockey World Championships. Nike used the composition in an advertisement series featuring the basketball opponents Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.\nThe popularity of \"Sandstorm\" as background music for those who stream their video gaming on the Twitch platform led to a meme that any question asking for the name of any song was"

It is the second track on their tenth studio album, All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), and was released as the album's second single on 29 January 2001. The band's lead vocalist Bono has said the song was inspired by a fictional conversation with his friend Michael Hutchence about suicide. The song peaked at number 52 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, their native Ireland and Italy, while reaching the top 10 in Australia, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Spain and the United Kingdom. In 2002, the song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" originated from a gospel-influenced chord progression that guitarist the Edge composed on a piano in a Japanese hotel room. He said: \"I suppose I was consciously looking for something in that [gospel] tradition. Having been through that whole experimentation period during Pop\u2014with techno and dance ideas and dance aesthetics\u2014it seemed like I wanted to get back to something a bit more earthy.\" During the recording sessions for All That You Can't Leave Behind, the Edge played the piano piece in a music sequencer, after which co-producer Brian Eno removed every first and second note, leaving every third note. Eno then set it into a different keyboard with extensive treatments, resulting in what the Edge called an \"otherworldly effect\" on top of his \"traditional gospel piano sequence\". Co-producer Daniel Lanois said the recorded version of the song was essentially a live take performed by the band with him and Eno. On guitar, Lanois played \"the harmony to The Edge's part\". The Edge achieved a clean guitar tone by plugging his 1950s Fender Stratocaster guitar directly into a Fender Bassman amplifier. The song ends with a \"choral chant\" written by the Edge; Lanois said they had always wanted to compose such a part before. The group tried several variations of it before settling on the version that appears on record. The vocals were sung by the Edge, Lanois, and Eno; Lanois said it was easy to imagine hiring a choir to sing the part but \"if you want it to sound like a U2 record, then you use the team\". Mick Jagger and his daughter Elizabeth recorded backing vocals for the song, although these did not make the final mix.\nU2's lead singer Bono wrote the lyrics about the suicide of his close friend Michael Hutchence, lead singer of the band INXS. The song is written in the form of an argument about suicide in which Bono tries to convince Hutchence of the act's foolishness. Bono characterised the song as a fight between friends, which he felt guilty for never having with Hutchence. As Bono said in 2005, \"It's a row between mates. You're kinda trying to wake them up out of an idea. In my case it's a row I didn't have while he was alive. I feel the biggest respect I could pay to him was not to write some stupid soppy song, so I wrote a really tough, nasty little number, slapping him around the head. And I'm sorry, but that's how it came out of me.\"\n\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" was released in the UK on 29 January 2001, in Australia on 12 February 2001, in the United States on 6 August 2001, and in Canada on 30 October 2001.\nThe song was performed at every show on the Elevation Tour in 2001. The song was not played again until the third leg on the Vertigo Tour in 2005 in an acoustic form by Bono and The Edge. The full band electric version was revived for the sixth leg of the Vertigo Tour in 2006. The song was performed on the U2 360\u00b0 Tour, again in an acoustic form by Bono and The Edge. The song was played five times on the Innocence + Experience Tour. These performances were by the full band and featured The Edge on the piano. The song was not performed on the Experience + Innocence Tour in 2018, but was played during many promotional shows for the Songs of Experience album. It made two appearances on The Joshua Tree Tour 2019. Both performances were in Sydney and were dedicated to Michael Hutchence.\nThree official music videos were filmed for the song. The first video (known as the US version) is directed by Joseph Kahn, features an American football game between the \"Flys\" [sic] and the \"Lemons\" filmed at the Houston Astrodome, and"

It was first released on 7 October 1998 in Italy by Bliss Corporation and became internationally successful the following year. It is the lead single of their debut album Europop. The song is the group's most popular single, reaching number one in many countries' music charts, such as Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, New Zealand, Israel, Lebanon, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Australia, Austria, Greece, Germany, and Hungary, as well as reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in January 2000.\nIn the United Kingdom, the song initially entered the top 40 purely on import sales; it was only the third single to do this. The song also received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 2001 Grammy Awards, two years after it was released.\nWritten by Eiffel 65 lead singer Jeffrey Jey, keyboardist Maurizio Lobina, and producer Massimo Gabutti, \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" was inspired by Lobina's composed opening piano hook. The producers of the song then came up with the idea for a dance song. Jey explained that his inspiration for the lyrics was how a person chooses their lifestyle. The colour blue as the main theme of the song was picked at random, with Lobina telling him to write nonsensical lyrics. Gabutti came up with the \"da ba dee\" hook. The pitch-shifted vocal effect used in the song was created with a harmonizer.\n\"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" is written in the key of G minor, with the vocal range spanning from C\u2083 to E\u266d\u2084, and is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 128 beats per minute.\nThe song's lyrics tell a story about a man who lives in a \"blue world.\" It also explains that he is \"blue inside and outside,\" which, alongside the lyric \"himself and everybody around 'cause he ain't got nobody to listen,\" and \"blue are the feelings that live inside me\" may indicate that the term blue represents his emotional state; however, the song also explains that a vast variety of what he owns is also blue, including his house and his car (\"a blue Corvette\"): different blue-coloured objects are also depicted on the single's cover. The song's hook is the sentence \"I'm blue,\" followed by a repetition of the sounds \"da ba dee da ba die\", which the hook is based around.\nThe song received mixed reviews from critics. Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that \"the hook here, with its dancy but curiously compelling singsongy rhythm and lyric, is destined to react instantly with listeners far and wide.\" He also noted that it has a \"euro sound\", and \"it's creative, it will affect listeners on both ends of the demographic spectrum, and it's anthemic.\" Entertainment Weekly positively reviewed the song, calling the song \"a fleeting, feel-good foot-tapper\" and gave the song a rating of B-. Daily Record said it is the \"strangest-sounding Euro-club hit of the summer\". The Daily Vault's Christopher Thelen described it as a \"quirky little hit\" with a \"bouncy chorus\". He also noted that \"the key is the use of the voice synthesizer\". PopMatters reviewer Chris Massey, in his review of Europop, described his initial reaction to the song as being \"really, really bad.\" However, he later stated in the review that after many repeated listenings of the song he \"loved it.\" AllMusic editor Jose F. Promis described the song as a \"hypnotic smash\" in his review of Europop.\nRolling Stone, however, in their review of Europop, gave the song a negative review, commenting that the song \"blends Cher-esque vocoder vocals, trance-like synth riffs, unabashed Eurodisco beats and a baby-babble chorus so infantile it makes the Teletubbies sound like Shakespeare.\" The magazine also placed the song on their list of the \"20 Most Annoying Songs,\" at No. 14.\nThe single, released in October 1998, was a chart-topper in many European countries. The song initially found success in France, where it debuted in August 1999 and reached number one for three weeks. It then found success in other European countries, reaching the top spot on many charts in September the same year, including Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and many other countries. It replaced \"Mambo No. 5\" by Lou Bega on many of these charts at the top spot. In the United Kingdom, the song spent three weeks at the top of the singles chart in September and"

It was released on January 26, 2009, as the third and final single from the group's self-titled debut album. Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, who comprise Lady Antebellum, co-wrote the song with Tom Douglas. \"I Run to You\" is the group's first number-one single, reaching that peak in July 2009, and it features lead vocals from both Scott and Kelley.\nThe song won the 2009 CMA Single of the Year Award on November 11, 2009.

It was released on August 9, 2010, in support of their debut UK live show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. The single made the A-list playlist on BBC Radio 2.\n\"I Run to You\" is a mid-tempo with electric guitar and string section accompaniment. In it, the narrators \u2014 lead singers Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott \u2014 claim that they turn to each other to escape the negativity and prejudice of the world.\nBrady Vercher of Engine 145 gave the song a \"thumbs down\" review, calling it \"a vague profession of love\" and adding, \"The song comes across as purposefully cryptic because they either didn\u2019t fully develop the idea, haven\u2019t become comfortable opening up in their lyrics, or they just didn\u2019t feel the need to focus on the lyric other than as a device to support the melody.\" Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song a B rating, saying that it \"rolls sweetly along and never tries to sound more important than it really is\".\nPaul Worley, who co-produced the album and played guitar on it, said, \"The song is an expression against hate, prejudice, negativity, running the rat race, but ultimately the redemption of love! And it has an irresistible melody and a head-bobbing groove. What could be better?\"\n\"I Run to You\" debuted at number 50 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart dated January 31, 2009. After spending 26 weeks on the chart, the song became the trio's first number one hit for the week of July 25, 2009. The song has also become Lady Antebellum's first top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 27.

It also debuted at number 27 on the U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary Tracks charts for the week of September 4, 2010.\nIt was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on April 29, 2013 for digital sales of 2,000,000 copies.\nA music video, directed by Adam Boatman, was released for the song in March 2009. The video follows a chain of events, which depicts how one good deed leads to another. It begins with a mother giving money to a man playing guitar on the sidewalk, who walks into a coffee shop and loans money to a businessman who left his wallet at home. The businessman then helps a woman pick up her stack of papers that scatters when she falls over. Later, the woman takes a seat on the bench and waits for the bus. The mother from the beginning arrives at the bus stop and she gives up her seat for her. Included with these are scenes of the trio singing in a small hotel room.\nA second video for the European release of \"I Run to You\" was shot and debuted on their record label Parlophone's YouTube page on July 30, 2010.

It was arranged by Charles Calello, and recorded at American Sound Studio in Memphis, Tennessee.\nIn a 2007 interview, Diamond stated the inspiration for his song was John F. Kennedy's daughter, Caroline, who was eleven years old at the time it was released. Diamond sang the song for her at her 50th birthday celebration in 2007. On December 21, 2011, in an interview on CBS's The Early Show, Diamond said that a magazine cover photo of Caroline Kennedy as a young child on a horse with her parents created an image in his mind, and the rest of the song came together about five years after seeing the picture. However, in 2014 Diamond said the song was about his then-wife Marcia, but he needed a three-syllable name to fit the melody. The song has proven to be enduringly popular and, as of November 2014, has sold over two million digital downloads in the United States.\nThe song reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart the week ending August 16, 1969, and was certified gold by the RIAA on August 18, 1969, for sales of one million singles. \"Sweet Caroline\" was also the first of fifty-eight entries on the US Easy Listening chart, peaking at #3.\nIn the autumn of 1969, Diamond performed \"Sweet Caroline\" on several television shows. It later reached No. 8 on the UK singles chart in March 1971.\nIn July 2021, Sweet Caroline entered the UK Singles Chart again 50 years after its first UK release, following its use by England supporters during Euro 2020, reaching No. 48 on the week ending 15 July and a week later it rose from 48 to 20.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three distinct mixes of this song. In the original mono 45 mix, the orchestra and glockenspiel are more prominent than in the stereo version on the Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show LP. The third version was a remix found only on the initial CD release of Diamond's His 12 Greatest Hits. This version has the orchestra mixed down and has the background vocals mixed up. It has a longer fade as well. A live version of the song is on his Hot August Night LP.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Diamond changed some of the lyrics to \"Hands ... washing hands ... don't touch me ... I won't touch you.\"\n\nThe National Football League's Carolina Panthers have played the song at all home games in Charlotte since 1996. In 2020, the Panthers played the song to an empty Bank of America Stadium in honor of all front-line workers in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe song has been played at Fenway Park, home of Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox, since at least 1997, and in the middle of the eighth inning at every game since 2002. On opening night of the 2010 season at Fenway Park, the song was performed live by Diamond himself.\nThe Iowa State Cyclones have used \"Sweet Caroline\" as a football victory song since 2006.\nSince 2008, the University of Pittsburgh has used \"Sweet Caroline\" as an unofficial school sing-along song by inserting \"Let's Go Pitt!\" over the instrumental three-beat \"Woah oh oh\" interval after the title refrain and replacing the repeated phrase \"So good\" with \"Go Pitt!\" The song started as a rallying anthem played between the third and fourth quarters of Pittsburgh Panthers football games, but has been adopted for use during other university sports contests, alumni events, and student ceremonies, including graduation commencement ceremonies, and references to the song have appeared on various school merchandise.\n\"Sweet Caroline\" is sometimes part of the regular rotation of songs during sports events at other universities, and although noted as not as being a tradition specific to or uniquely associated with Pennsylvania State University, out of a speculated concern with the song's lyrics in the wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, the university removed the song from the rotation of music played at football games prior to the 2012 season. However, performances resumed to loud renditions at Penn State football games in September 2013.\nSeveral days after the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013, Neil Diamond led the crowd at Fenway Park in a rendition of the song.  Sales of the song surged nearly 600 percent in the week after the bombings, to 19,000 copies, up from 2,800 the week before. Diamond said that he would donate his royalties from those sales  to the One Fund Boston charity to help the people affected by the bombings.\nOn February 22, 2020, newly crowned WBC and The Ring"

(2015). The song was released worldwide on 31 July 2015 and was the band's first single since Zayn Malik's departure earlier that same year. \"Drag Me Down\" debuted atop the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Austria, Australia, and New Zealand. It became the group's first number one single in France and Australia, as well as their fourth number one in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and won the fan-voted 'Best Video Award' at the 2016 Brit Awards.\n\"Drag Me Down\" is marked as One Direction's first single since Zayn Malik's departure in March 2015. The announcement of the release, with no previous promotion or marketing, was done by Liam Payne on his Twitter handle, followed by the rest of the members on 31 July 2015.\n\"Drag Me Down\" is a midtempo pop rock track written by Jamie Scott, Julian Bunetta and John Ryan, who wrote and produced several songs on One Direction's previous two albums Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014). According to Los Angeles Times's editor Mikael Wood, the production contains springy guitars that recall The Police or \"Rude\" by Magic!. The song is written in C minor with a tempo of 138 beats per minute.\nJason Lipshutz of Billboard gave the song three and a half out of five stars and stated that the song offers a more \"mature sound\". He also commented \"for those worried that a four-member incarnation of the group can't get the job done, \"Drag Me Down\" assuages those fears by keeping the overall quality level high\" and \"the group compensates for Malik\u2019s absence by giving each member ample time to shine, and the harmonies admirably resonate on the call-and-response portions of the pre-chorus\". Writing for Idolater, Robbie Daw commented that the song \"comes across perhaps like the first One Direction song that might appeal to an audience outside of the band\u2019s screaming core fan base\".\nGaby Hernandez of Rolling Stone described the song as a \"pop-rock track shifts the band\u2019s sound from the softer folk of their last album, Four, back to the more upbeat, electronic heavy elements of their first two albums\". Jamieson Cox of The Verge called the song \"a slight departure from the music the band was making with Malik in tow\" while commenting that \"there's a bit of The Police in the loping, reggae-lite bass line and guitar riffs, and the song's structure is cribbed from the last few years' finest EDM-pop crossovers\" and that \"when you fold in the melody, the whole package reminds me of Taylor Swift's \"I Knew You Were Trouble,\" and that qualifies as praise in this space\". Noelle Devoe, writing for The Daily Telegraph, described the song as \"rocking an even edgier, mature sound\" and \"a love song to their fans\" while commenting on Styles' high notes. The Herald wrote that \"in true One Direction style, Drag Me Down is a catchy love song with a poppy beat\". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars, and stated that \"Drag Me Down\" is \"one of their most pop-centric releases to date\" and that \"they may have taken a hit with the exit of Zayn, but One Direction are far from down and out\".\nMikael Wood with the Los Angeles Times gave a more negative review, stating that the song is \"all too accurately titled\" and that it is \"decidedly smaller-scaled\" and \"carries no such charge\" compared to the band's previous songs. He added \"we\u2019re basically talking about a midtempo pop-rock jam with springy guitars that recall The Police\" and the song is \"more or less what you\u2019d expect from a band of four good-looking white guys\".\nPast member Zayn Malik took to social media and praised the single, describing it as \"sick\" and stating that \"he was proud of his boys.\"\nThe video for \"Drag Me Down\" was directed by Ben and Gabe Turner and filmed at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas and premiered on Vevo on 31 July 2015. The video includes the band being put through their paces as though they are astronauts preparing for a space mission. It won the fan-voted 'Best Video Award' at the 2016 Brit Awards and as of 10 July 2021, it has been viewed about 960 million times on YouTube.\nIn Fall 2015, the Big Payno Remix was released which features American rapper Lunchmoney Lewis which appears on their Perfect EP.\nOne Direction gave their first performance of the song on their On the Road Again Tour in Indianapolis on 31 July 2015 until the end of their concert tour.

It served as their debut single and lead single from their debut studio album, Up All Night (2011). Written by Savan Kotecha and producer Rami Yacoub, the song was released by Syco Records on 11 September 2011. The uptempo power pop track features a prominent guitar-based chorus and riff. The middle eight consists of a \"na na na\" hook.\n\"What Makes You Beautiful\" was a commercial success, reaching number one in several countries. It has been certified quadruple platinum in the US with sales of 4.8 million copies as of June 2016. The single peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the UK Singles Chart. The song won the 2012 Brit Award for British Single of the Year and was generally complimented by contemporary music critics, who highlighted the appeal to the teenage audience and the pop sensibility. It debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart after setting a Sony Music Entertainment pre-order record and selling 153,965 copies in its first week. The single also topped the Irish and Scottish Singles Charts, and reached the top ten on the Australian and New Zealand Singles Charts, Flemish Ultratop 50, Canadian Hot 100, and the Japan Hot 100.\nThe accompanying music video, directed by John Urbano, depicts One Direction spending time on a beach in Malibu, California. The music video was uploaded to YouTube on 19 August 2011 and has accumulated more than 1.2 billion views since it premiered.  The clip garnered the group three MTV Video Music Awards at the 2012 ceremony. One Direction performed the song live on televised shows, at awards ceremonies, and on all four of their major concert tours: Up All Night Tour (2011\u201312), Take Me Home Tour (2013), Where We Are Tour (2014) and On the Road Again Tour (2015), while band member Harry Styles performed the song on his 2017 solo tour, as well as his 2021 solo tour and serves as the only One Direction song he performs. Artists including the Piano Guys have covered \"What Makes You Beautiful\".\n\"What Makes You Beautiful\" was written by Savan Kotecha and Carl Falk, and was produced by Yacoub and Falk. Instrumentation was completed by Falk and Yacoub. Serban Ghenea handled the audio mixing, Tom Coyne the audio mastering, and John Hanes the mix engineering, for which Phil Seaford served as the assistant. Discussing the song's conception, Kotecha said: \nI had the melody of the chorus in my song for about a year until I was in a hotel room in London with my wife and she was having a bad morning. She was like, \"Oh, I feel so ugly\" and I was like, \"No, you look beautiful. You don\u2019t know how beautiful you look.\" And I was like, \"Oh, crap! That\u2019s a good song! Hold on!\" And I wrote that down. I actually wrote the song for my wife, so I went to the studio and it took a process of a couple weeks to really tweak it, but the core of it was written within two days and then tweaked a few things here and there over a couple weeks, but I mean, I still have the text message from Harry [Styles]. When he heard the demo, I was in Miami on my way back to Sweden, and he sent me a text message saying, \"I think you got it. I think you got the one here.\"\nAfter recording the song at Cosmos Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, the band felt relieved to have a song that they were happy to release as their debut single. Band member Liam Payne called the song \"perfect\", and Harry Styles said, \"When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track to be our first single.\" Styles spoke to MTV News, \"I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun. It kind of represented us, I think it took us a while to find it but I think we found the right song.\" Payne added, \"We always wanted [the single] to be something that people didn't expect and then when we heard it, it wasn't what we expected either so it kind of fitted perfectly.\"\n\"What Makes You Beautiful\" premiered on BBC Radio 1 on 10 August 2011, and was released by Syco Music in Europe, Australia and New Zealand via digital download on 11 September 2011. A CD single was released in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2011, and followed in Australia and Germany on 25 November 2011 and 2 December 2011, respectively. In North America, the single was released in Canada via digital download on 31 January 2012. It was issued 14 February 2012 in the"

It was a number-one Billboard Hot 100 hit for two weeks in the summer of 1989. An edited version of the song is included in the imported version of the album Toy Soldiers: The Best of Martika.\nMartika wrote the song about a friend who was battling a cocaine addiction. \"I was a little hesitant because I had only written two songs before and they were light songs. I came up to Michael and said I wanted to write about drugs. It was the first time I got the nerve to write about something that was scary for me to talk about, so I did.\" According to an episode of VH-1's Pop-Up Video, in which \"Toy Soldiers\" was featured, the friend-in-question eventually conquered the addiction.\nThe song is performed in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 65 beats per minute in  time.  The song follows a chord progression of A\u2013B\u2013A\u2013B\u2013C\u266fm\u2013B\u2013C\u266fm\u2013G\u266fm\u2013C\u266fm\u2013B.\nBryan Buss of AllMusic retrospectively reviewed the Martika album, stating \"the big hit single, 'Toy Soldiers', works with its childlike vocals and lyrics, creating a haunting, effective dichotomy with its subject of drug addiction.\" Buss also highlighted the song as an album standout by labeling it an AMG Pick Track. Rob Theakston of Allmusic labeled the song as an AMG Pick Track on the 2005 compilation Toy Soldiers: The Best of Martika.\nThe song spent two weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. and New Zealand while reaching number five in both the United Kingdom and Australia. On Billboard's year-end chart for 1989, \"Toy Soldiers\" placed number 29. It was Martika's only number-one single in the U.S., and her highest-ranking single in the United Kingdom. The single was certified Gold in the United States by the RIAA.\nIn March and April 2009, VH1 ran a countdown of the 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s. \"Toy Soldiers\" placed at number 67 on the countdown, although Martika had three other top 40 hits: \"More Than You Know\" (number 18); \"I Feel the Earth Move\" (number 25); and \"Love... Thy Will Be Done\" (number 10).\nThe video for the song was directed by Jim Shea, who later became a regular in directing country music videos. Martika is seen singing with a waterfall in front of her (this was done by filming her in an empty pool with a water current flowing between her and the camera).\nMartika is the lead singer throughout the song and is joined on the chorus by some of her former castmates from Kids Incorporated: Stacy Ferguson (Fergie), Rahsaan Patterson, and Renee Sands, as well as later cast members Kimberly McCullough and Devyn Puett as backup vocalists (\"The Toy Soldiers\").\n7-inch single\n\"Toy Soldiers\" \u2013 4:52\n\"Exchange of Hearts\" \u2013 4:15\n3-inch single\n\"Toy Soldiers\" \u2013 4:52\n\"Exchange of Hearts\" \u2013 4:15\n\"It's Not What You're Doing\" \u2013 4:11\n12-inch single\n\"Toy Soldiers\" \u2013 4:52\n\"It's Not What You're Doing\" \u2013 4:11\n\"Exchange of Hearts\" \u2013 4:15\n\n\n\n\nMartika recorded and produced a Spanish version of \"Toy Soldiers\" renaming it \"Como Un Juguete\", though it was not as successful as the original English version. She also recorded the song in Japanese.\nEminem's 2005 single \"Like Toy Soldiers\" features samples from \"Toy Soldiers\". A sample of Martika's singing the chorus is used as the chorus of the Eminem version. The subject of the Eminem song is markedly different from the Martika song, concerning violence and murder linked to rap music rather than drug addiction. The sample is played faster than the original version with an added drum beat. The final chorus of Martika's song is used as the chorus of Eminem's version.\nMy Vitriol covered the song for their 2007 EP A Pyrrhic Victory.\nSilversun Pickups covered the song for a 2020 7\" single titled Toy Soldiers.\nAmber Van Day's 2020 single Kids in the Corner features melodic hints from \"Toy Soldiers\".\nList of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1989\n\"American single   certifications \u2013 Martika \u2013 Toy Soldiers\".

Noelle Devoe, writing for The Daily Telegraph, described the song as \"rocking an even edgier, mature sound\" and \"a love song to their fans\" while commenting on Styles' high notes. The Herald wrote that \"in true One Direction style, Drag Me Down is a catchy love song with a poppy beat\". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars, and stated that \"Drag Me Down\" is \"one of their most pop-centric releases to date\" and that \"they may have taken a hit with the exit of Zayn, but One Direction are far from down and out\".\nMikael Wood with the Los Angeles Times gave a more negative review, stating that the song is \"all too accurately titled\" and that it is \"decidedly smaller-scaled\" and \"carries no such charge\" compared to the band's previous songs. He added \"we\u2019re basically talking about a midtempo pop-rock jam with springy guitars that recall The Police\" and the song is \"more or less what you\u2019d expect from a band of four good-looking white guys\".\nPast member Zayn Malik took to social media and praised the single, describing it as \"sick\" and stating that \"he was proud of his boys.\"\nThe video for \"Drag Me Down\" was directed by Ben and Gabe Turner and filmed at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas and premiered on Vevo on 31 July 2015. The video includes the band being put through their paces as though they are astronauts preparing for a space mission. It won the fan-voted 'Best Video Award' at the 2016 Brit Awards and as of 10 July 2021, it has been viewed about 960 million times on YouTube.\nIn Fall 2015, the Big Payno Remix was released which features American rapper Lunchmoney Lewis which appears on their Perfect EP.\nOne Direction gave their first performance of the song on their On the Road Again Tour in Indianapolis on 31 July 2015 until the end of their concert tour.

(2015). The song was released worldwide on 31 July 2015 and was the band's first single since Zayn Malik's departure earlier that same year. \"Drag Me Down\" debuted atop the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Austria, Australia, and New Zealand. It became the group's first number one single in France and Australia, as well as their fourth number one in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and won the fan-voted 'Best Video Award' at the 2016 Brit Awards.\n\"Drag Me Down\" is marked as One Direction's first single since Zayn Malik's departure in March 2015. The announcement of the release, with no previous promotion or marketing, was done by Liam Payne on his Twitter handle, followed by the rest of the members on 31 July 2015.\n\"Drag Me Down\" is a midtempo pop rock track written by Jamie Scott, Julian Bunetta and John Ryan, who wrote and produced several songs on One Direction's previous two albums Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014). According to Los Angeles Times's editor Mikael Wood, the production contains springy guitars that recall The Police or \"Rude\" by Magic!. The song is written in C minor with a tempo of 138 beats per minute.\nJason Lipshutz of Billboard gave the song three and a half out of five stars and stated that the song offers a more \"mature sound\".

It was produced by Pharrell Williams, who also provided backing vocals. The song was released by Asylum Records UK on 7 April 2014 as the lead single from Sheeran's second studio album, \u00d7 (2014). \"Sing\" became Sheeran's first UK number-one single and also topped the charts in Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. It peaked at number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\"Sing\" was written by Sheeran and Pharrell Williams, and produced by the latter. Williams also provides uncredited background vocals during the chorus. The song has a length of 3 minutes and 55 seconds. The song, which has pop and R&B influences and was inspired by Justin Timberlake, is a departure from the folk rock sound Sheeran became known for on his previous album, +. Sheeran was inspired to model the song after the pop and R&B stylings of Timberlake, stating \"It was pretty close to a direct inspiration. I love Justified and FutureSex/LoveSounds, so I took inspiration from those.\" The lyrics are about \"a night out in Vegas.\"\n\"Sing\" was released in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and Germany in May 2014. Aside from these nations, \"Sing\" was released internationally on 7 April 2014, during a YouTube live chat with Sheeran. \"Friends\", a track from the EP, entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 121.\nThe song received critical acclaim upon release; music critics complimented Sheeran's change of sound, and likened the song to the works of Justin Timberlake. Time gave the song a very positive review, saying that it is \"more of a departure. It fits the times nicely: there's some of fellow Brit, Sam Smith, in Sheeran's rubbery falsetto, plus some of Robin Thicke's ubiquitous 'Blurred Lines' in the percussion. But Sheeran's really got his heavy-breathing, hyper-flirtatious sights on another, older target: Justin Timberlake's solo debut, 'Like I Love You'.\" The chorus riff and falsetto are from \"Miss You\" by The Rolling Stones.\nIn a positive review, The Guardian said that \"while Pharrell's influence is writ large, there's enough of Sheeran there to prevent it coming across as horrible pastiche.\" The Hollywood Reporter also gave the song a positive review, stating that \"Sheeran's fragile voice, as heard on past hits like 'The A Team' and 'Lego House,' has now morphed into a confident croon, unafraid of diving into a deep bag of melismas, boisterous chants and rapid-fire rhymes in order to convince his female subject of his desires.\"\nThe song debuted at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart and Irish Singles Chart, giving him his first ever number-one singles in both the United Kingdom and Ireland. The song has sold 670,000 copies in actual sales in the United Kingdom, which together with 66 million in streams give a combine total units of 1,339,000.\n\"Sing\" debuted at No. 1 on the Australian ARIA Charts in May 2014, making it Sheeran's first ever number-one in the country, and his sixth top ten single in Australia. On the week of 14 April 2014, the song entered the New Zealand Singles Chart at No. 8, becoming his fourth top 10 single and second top 10 debut in New Zealand. The song has since topped the charts in that country, giving Sheeran his second consecutive number-one single there. In Italy, \"Sing\" has peaked at No. 2 and spent five total weeks at this position, giving him the higher peak position reached in the country, so far.\nIn Canada, the track has since peaked at No. 4, giving Sheeran his first ever top 10 hits in the country. \"Sing\" debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Sheeran his highest-charting single in the United States, at the time. The single managed to sell 123,000 copies, giving him his second best sales week digitally; the song also managed to net 563,000 streams and earn 28 million in audience impressions, all before its debut week on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Sing\" has since peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.  The song reached its million sales mark in the US in July 2014, and has sold 1,323,000 copies as of January 2015.\nThe music video for \"Sing\" was released exclusively to Sheeran's Facebook page on 22 May 2014, and added to Vevo and YouTube on 23 May, exactly a month before the album was released. It follows a puppet caricature of Sheeran on a night out, during which he gets drunk, steals a mic (from actor Peter Kwong from Big Trouble in Little China) and sings karaoke, goes to a strip club and picks up Sheeran and Pharrell from a studio in his truck. Throughout the video Sheeran is seen playing his guitar in front of an optical illusion-esque backdrop.\nThe"

Written by Allen and Greg Kurstin, the song was released as the lead single from the album. Initially, \"Everyone's at It\" was announced to be the first single from the album. However, it was ultimately decided on \"The Fear\" to be released on 26 January 2009 by Regal Recordings, while Allen posted the demo (which was then titled \"I Don't Know\") onto her MySpace account in April 2008. The song incorporates electropop music as the lyrics articulate problems with celebrity lifestyles and include metaphors for recognised tabloid national newspapers such as The Sun and the Daily Mirror.\nContemporary critics complimented the song and its themes of consumerism and the postmodern condition. \"The Fear\" topped the UK Singles Chart for four consecutive weeks, thus becoming the longest running number 1 in the UK of 2009, while peaking inside the top 10 in Australia and Ireland and the top 20 in several European countries. It is also Allen's second entry on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, where it reached number 80.\nThe accompanying music video portrayed a fantasy theme, with Allen dancing with giant wrapped gifts and balloons. It was shot at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire and also featured dancers dressed as butlers; the locations were initially in a caravan in a park, and then in a giant colourful mansion, surrounded by contrasting grey clouds. The song was performed live for the first time via The Scott Mills Show on BBC Radio 1 and during Allen's 2009 concert tour. \"The Fear\" was awarded with Best Track prize at the 2009 Q Awards, and also won Allen two Ivor Novello Awards in 2010, for best song musically and lyrically, and most performed work.\nAllen wrote and recorded the song with Greg Kurstin in a cottage located in Moreton-in-Marsh in 2007. She released a demo version of the song, which was then called \"I Don't Know\", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, \"I Could Say\", in April 2008. Initially, the song \"Everyone's at It\" was announced to be released as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on \"The Fear\". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make \"bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit as a person and I hope it reflects that.\" The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: \n[I'll] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village in the middle of the countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture \u2013 but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.\nMusically, Allen adopts a more mature electropop groove for the song, which has been described to have \"a pulsing, sleekly modern electro dance backing\", while coming through a \"flood of soft synths\" and being \"eminently danceable and slightly trancey\". It is set in common time and in the key of F major and has a metronome of 134 beats per minute. Allen's voice spans from F\u2083 to A\u2084. Lyrically, the song is a satire of materialism \"sung in the voice of a would-be starlet\", and tackles societal consumerism and overnight-fame-hunting. It also makes reference, through the line \"I'll look at The Sun and I'll look in The Mirror\", at the daily British tabloid national newspapers The Sun and Daily Mirror, which often report on Allen. The synthesiser parts were written by Greg Kurstin using Apple's Logic Studio, using its built-in instruments.\n\"The Fear\" received positive reviews from music critics. Michael Menachem from Billboard commented on the song, saying it \"packs another lyrical punch\", while complimenting Allen's vocals. Lucy Davies of the BBC described the song as \"[e]minently danceable and slightly trancey\". Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph suggested that the song"

Allen co-wrote the song with its producer, Greg Kurstin. Musically, \"Hard out Here\" is a synth-pop song with lyrics revolving around \"body image pressures and misogyny in the entertainment industry\".\n\"Hard out Here\" was critically acclaimed; many critics praised its lyrical content and praised Allen's take on the industry, dubbing the song a \"feminist anthem through and through\". According to The Wire, the title is a \"thinly veiled reference\" to Three 6 Mafia's Academy Award-winning 2005 song \"It's Hard out Here for a Pimp\". The song topped the Austrian chart and reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland.\nTo promote the song, Allen performed at YoYos pod in London. The music video for the song was directed by Christopher Sweeney and premiered on Allen's website on 12 November 2013. The video depicts Allen receiving liposuction and twerking. The video received positive reviews from most critics, but also sparked minor controversy over the ethnicity of the backing dancers.\nAllen released her second album It's Not Me, It's You in 2009, which saw a genre shift to synth-pop, rather than the ska and reggae influences used in her debut album, Alright, Still (2006). The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian Albums Chart and was well received by critics, noting the singer's musical evolution and maturity. It spawned the hit singles \"The Fear\" and \"Fuck You\", popular mostly in Europe. Allen and Amy Winehouse were credited with starting a process that led to the media-proclaimed \"year of the women\" in 2009 that has seen five female artists making music of \"experimentalism and fearlessness\" nominated for the Mercury Prize.\nIn 2009, Allen announced that she would be taking a hiatus from musical activities. The following year, she opened a fashion rental shop named Lucy in Disguise with her sister Sarah, followed by the 2011 launching of her own record label.\nIn 2013, Allen revealed that she had begun working on her third studio album Sheezus. On 20 June 2012, Allen tweeted that she was in the studio working with Greg Kurstin on new music. She changed her professional name from Lily Allen to Lily Rose Cooper. In August 2013 she changed her professional name back to Lily Allen and tweeted new music would be arriving \"soon\".\n\"Hard out Here\" was written by Allen and Greg Kurstin, with production handled by the latter. Lasting for three minutes and twenty two seconds, musically \"Hard out Here\" is a \"typically outspoken, sweary\" synth-pop song. Lyrically, it speaks about \"body image pressures and misogyny in the entertainment industry\". The song's verses introduce the concept of the song: \"You should probably lose some weight 'cause we can't see your bones/ You should probably fix your face or you'll end up on your own.\" The overall message of the song, as well as several individual lyrics, have been interpreted as a response to Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\", as well as Thicke and Miley Cyrus's performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and Cyrus's music video \"We Can't Stop\". However, Allen has said with regard to people's description of \"Hard out Here\" as a \"We Can't Stop\" parody that \"I never went on record saying the video was a direct pop at her\u2014it wasn't.\"\n\"Hard out Here\" received critical acclaim upon release. Rolling Stone praised the song calling it a \"feminist anthem through and through\" and praised the subjects in which Allen tackles including \"tired gender roles and expectations to double standards regarding sex and appearance for men and women\". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy rated the song four out of five stars, calling it \"a welcome return to music for Lily Allen\" and stating, \"Ever the ambassador for a social critique, [Allen] wasn't going to let 2013 end without having her say on the current objectification of women in pop\u2014and that includes poking fun at that twerking malarky.\" The Wire viewed the song's title as a \"thinly veiled reference\" to Three 6 Mafia's Academy Award-winning 2005 song \"It's Hard out Here for a Pimp\".\n\"Hard out Here\" debuted at number nine on the UK Singles Chart, selling 30,213 copies in its first week, giving Allen two simultaneous top ten singles (the other being Somewhere Only We Know which was at the peak of the chart that week).\nThe single was notably successful in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland,"

Both the film and the soundtrack were abandoned in 1989, due to spiralling costs and the commercial failure of the soundtrack single \"Kylie Said to Jason\".  However, much of the musical material was salvaged and substantially remodelled to form the basis of their later, commercially successful work.  In particular, bootlegged copies of \"Go to Sleep\" reveal many chord sequences and melodies later used in \"Last Train to Trancentral\".\nOne month prior to the \"Pure Trance\" single release, many of the same core elements were also used in ambient form during the tracks \"Wichita Lineman was a Song I Once Heard\" and \"Trancentral Lost in My Mind\" on the KLF's album Chill Out.\nThe original March 1990 12\" single constituted the third of The KLF's \"Pure Trance\" series. The sleeve, emblazoned with the number 5, reflects The KLF's prior intention that this be the fifth contribution to the series, but two titles (\"Love Trance\" and \"Turn up the Strobe\") were never released despite the sleeves having been printed.\nThe \"Pure Trance\" version of \"Last Train to Trancentral\" is a minimalist ambient house reworking of \"Go to Sleep\", stripped of the female vocals and all but one line (\"And from somewhere, I hear\") of The KLF co-founder Bill Drummond's narration.  It features a strained, chordless synthesiser melody and a progressive instrumental build-up into a string-orchestrated break.  Some parts of the track are purely percussive, punctuated by the bleats of sheep.  The track was incorporated into The KLF's February 1990 album Chill Out (most prominently on the track \"Wichita Lineman Was a Song I Once Heard\"), an album for which they have been credited as pioneers of the ambient house genre.  Indeed, upon its release, \"Last Train to Trancentral (Pure Trance version)\" was not easily categorised, with Record Mirror claiming that \"it isn't a dance track\".\nIn March 1991, a version of \"Last Train to Trancentral\" appeared on The KLF LP The White Room.  Featuring vocals by reggae musician Black Steel and a rap by Ricardo Da Force, this house reworking follows a conventional song structure, with a rhythm that mimics the sound of a train in motion along its tracks.  It uses the theme of a journey to bridge the two sides of the LP, from uptempo pop-house music to a downtempo collection of songs.\nIn April 1991, some elements of the \"LP Version\" were further reworked into a commercially minded single release.  Entitled \"Last Train to Trancentral (Live from the Lost Continent)\", this was the third and final instalment of The KLF's so-called \"Stadium House Trilogy\" of singles, following up \"What Time Is Love?\" and \"3 a.m. Eternal\" during the peak of the band's mainstream popularity. This version reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, and found top ten chart success internationally.  The track preserves the chord progression and string break of previous versions, placed in the context of a relentless, sample-filled rave arrangement.  Unlike the prior Stadium House offerings, Ricardo Da Force's rap was removed, except for \"This is what The KLF is about, also known as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, furthermore known as The JAMs...\", but the trilogy is consolidated by the presence of distinctive samples from both \"What Time Is Love?\" and \"3 a.m. Eternal\".  As with much of The KLF's output, the track is jubilant and highly self-referential, purporting that it has a message to deliver yet proceeding with deliberate ambiguity.  Also typical of The KLF, it refers to The Illuminatus! Trilogy novels and the Lost Continent of Mu.  The song features on The KLF's video The Stadium House Trilogy.\nA remix 12\" credited to The Moody Boys was released alongside the Stadium House"

It was written by Madonna and Rick Nowels, and was produced by the singer with William Orbit and Patrick Leonard. The song was released as the fourth single from the album on September 22, 1998, being additionally distributed as a double A-Side single in the United Kingdom with \"Little Star\". Lyrically, the track talks about how free and empowering saying good-bye or ending a relationship can feel. The melancholy electronica ballad features shuffle beats, acoustic guitars and sweeping strings arranged by Craig Armstrong.\n\"The Power of Good-Bye\" received acclaim from music critics, who went on to recognize the song as one of the best on Ray of Light, with praise going to its instrumentation and electronic vibe, as well as Madonna's vocals which were compared to \"Frozen\" (1998). The song attained commercial success across Europe, reaching the top 10\u00a0of the charts in over nine countries, including Austria, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Spain and the United Kingdom, while in the United States it reached number 11, becoming Madonna's 37th top 20\u00a0hit and her seventh-highest debut at the time. Its blue-green tinted music video was directed by Matthew Rolston in Malibu, California and features actor Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107 as her love interest. Madonna has performed the song live on several award shows and during various appearances on television but has never included it in the standard set list on tour.\nBetween 1996 and the release of this song's associated album in 1998, Madonna went through a number of \"life-changing experiences\" including giving birth to her daughter Lourdes, interest in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, as well as playing the title role in the film adaptation of the musical Evita (1996). A year later, following the promotion of the Evita soundtrack, she started working on Ray of Light; the album would reflect her changed perspectives about life. Madonna wrote songs with William Orbit, Patrick Leonard and Rick Nowels.\nIn the meantime, Madonna had written \"The Power of Good-Bye\" with Nowels; it was one of the nine songs they had written for the album. Nowels had always wanted to work with Madonna, admiring her previous work with Leonard, Stephen Bray as well as Nile Rodgers. The songwriter was in New York for the Grammy Awards, and during a shopping expedition in Barneys, he met Madonna. Nowels commended the singer on her songwriting skills, being later invited to Los Angeles for writing sessions. According to Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, \"[Nowels] was struck by [Madonna's] lyric writing\", admitting that, \"It was deep, poetic and intelligent. When she's on and at her best she's on a par with Joni Mitchell or Paul Simon\". He also stated that the singer's songwriting prowess was benefited from her \"voracious reading\". Three songs from their sessions were selected for the final track list, \"The Power of Good-Bye\", \"Little Star\" and \"To Have and Not to Hold\".\nAfter issuing \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" as the album's third single worldwide, \"The Power of Good-Bye\" was chosen to be released as the album's fourth single, since \"radio programmers and diehard fans [had] long been clamoring [for it].\" In the United States, the song was the album's third single, available from September 22, 1998 in a two-track format. In the United Kingdom, \"The Power of Good-Bye\" was distributed as a double A-side with \"Little Star\". In the rest of Europe, the latter was included on the single releases as a B-side. In the European maxi-singles, several experimental remixes of the track by Luke Slater and an additional remix by Dallas Austin, who previously worked with Madonna on her Bedtime Stories (1994) album, were included. As noted by AllMusic's Jose F. Promis, the \"Luke Slater's Super Luper Mix\" \"turns the ballad into a thumping deep house anthem, making it sound like a completely different song.\" Meanwhile, \"Fabien's Good God Mix\" is described as \"an electronic, tripped-out, drum'n'bass-heavy mix which keeps the integrity of the original song\", Promis noted.\nAfter the songwriting sessions ended with Nowels, Madonna started collaborating with Orbit"

Priscilla Renea wrote the song with Emanuel Kiriakou, who produced the track. The song was released in March 2011, as the lead single from the band's third album, When the Sun Goes Down (2011). According to Gomez, the song was intended to inspire people, and fire back at the \"haters\", particularly those involved in cyberbullying. \"Who Says\" marks a distinct departure in sound for the band, as it has an acoustic and organic feel, compared to their dance-pop and club-oriented previous singles.\n\"Who Says\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who appreciated its message and the change of pace for the band. The song charted in the top thirty in the United States, Canada and New Zealand, and it became their highest charting single on these charts at the time. It also reached the lower regions of European charts. \"Who Says\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It also became the act's third No. 1 Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. The song's accompanying music video features Gomez frolicking around a city, removing makeup, and performing with the band on a beach. Gomez performed the song on a variety occasions including at the 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards, on Dancing with the Stars, and So Random!.\nIn 2009, the band released their debut album Kiss & Tell and quickly followed-up with 2010's A Year Without Rain. After the release of the latter, Gomez said that she was not in a rush to release another album, but after hearing \"Who Says\", she decided to begin another release, calling the song \"amazing\" and crediting it for inspiring her. Gomez would later call the song \"fun and empowering\", commenting, \"Every time I sing this song, I'm like, 'I feel better already!'\" When talking about the song's message, Gomez commented that she thought of it as \"sweet\", going on to say, \"with bullying, with cyberbullying, with all the negativity that is in high school and dealing with things, you're already trying to figure out who you are; it doesn't help when people are constantly trying to tear you down.\" She then said that she was \"dealing with it, of course\" and was \"going through it as well\". After debuting the single on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Gomez mentioned the criticism received on Twitter and Facebook due to being a celebrity.\nTwitter and Facebook are really negative for me\u00a0\u2026 within that world is such easy access to people's feelings. You can get a thousand wonderful comments but just one will throw you off and that's how it is with me. Basically it's to the haters\u2014the people trying to bring you down.\n\u2014\u2009Selena Gomez\nThe single follows in succession of other self-empowerment singles such as \"We R Who We R\" by Kesha, \"Firework\" by Katy Perry, \"Fuckin' Perfect\" by Pink, and \"Born This Way\" by Lady Gaga. Gomez herself stated \"I am so happy [about recent empowerment songs], 'cause music is a universal language, and it's a quick way to get to everybody. The fact that all these artists are doing that, it's really good. I'm really happy.\" The song was released on iTunes in the United States and Canada on March 14, 2011. It was released as a CD single in Germany on March 15, 2011, with the B-side of \"Ghost of You\" from A Year Without Rain.\nThe song is a departure in her previous singles such as \"Round & Round\" and \"Naturally\", whereas the previous were dance-pop and club-oriented, \"Who Says\" has an \"organic\" and \"acoustic\" feel. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, \"Who Says\" is set in common time in a moderate tempo of 101 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major as Gomez's vocal range spans from the low-note of G#\u2083 to the high-note of E\u2085. The song contains string accents described as \"sympathetic, but not overpowering\". Described as a \"jangly pop tune\", having an \"overarching feel-good vibe\", lyrically, the song speaks of \"embracing who you are and not letting your critics get you down\". Gomez sings of insecurities, and people telling her she is not good enough, before asserting \"I'm sure you got some things/ You'd like to change about yourself/ But when it comes to me/ I wouldn't want to be anybody else.\"\nAccording to Brian Voerding of AOL Radio Blog, \"Gomez sings about staying true to herself, particularly in the face of doubt that comes from others telling her she can't live up to her dreams\"."

It was released on August 25, 2009 as the lead single from the album. The song was co-written by Emily Osment and Anthony Fagenson, and was produced by James Maxwell Collins. Lyrically, Osment stated she wanted the song to be about \"breaking out\" and that \"a lot of kids can relate to that\".\nThe song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Some have praised Osment's \"spunk\", and also make comment about how she chose not to join with Hollywood Records, like most other Disney Channel artist and instead joined Wind-Up Records (the label that is home to Creed and Evanescence). However, some call the song childish, stating that Osment tries to come across as \"fierce\", but just falls flat in the end. However, some have praised the single, calling it a magnificent start to her career. Osment herself has stated that the song is influenced by Alanis Morissette's album, Jagged Little Pill.\n\"All the Way Up\" failed to garner much attention on the music charts, but it did manage to enter the charts in a few international territories, as well as becoming a hit on Radio Disney. The music video was directed by Roman White and features Osment, along with the band and labelmates Push Play rehearsing a performance of the song in their apartment. The video shows the effects the loud music has on all of the surrounding apartments. \"All the Way Up\" was performed on Osment's first tour, the \"Clap Your Hands Tour\", as well as the American talk show, The View.\n\"All the Way Up\" was co-written by Osment, along with James Maxwell Collins and Anthony Fagenson. The song was recorded by Osment while on the set of the hit Disney show, Hannah Montana. She stated during an interview that the song was finished after nearly 3 months of working on it. The single was debuted on Radio Disney on August 25, 2009, and was released for radio airplay the following day. Originally, You Are the Only One was intended to be released as the lead single. However, Osment pushed for the release of \"All the Way Up\", and eventually her record label agreed to release it as her debut single.\n\"All the Way Up\" has an emphasis mainly on the bass and drums, but the guitar is also dominant in the song. Osment has listed Alanis Morissette as one of the main inspirations for the single, and album in general. She stated that Morissette's album Jagged Little Pill was the main influence for her musical career, and that she had incorporated themes from the album into her own. When being interviewed about the single, Osment stated\n\u201cThat song was written about a year ago and I recorded the final recording three or four months ago. I wrote it with Tony Fagenson and Max Collins.... When we first wrote it we wanted to write a song about breaking out... A lot of kids can connect with that because we all have strange habits.\nThe lyrics to \"All the Way Up\" were co-written by Osment, with all of her teenage fans in mind. It speaks of wanting to break out, and just be who you want to be. The main example of this theme is shown in the chorus of the single, when Osment sings the line, \"All the way up, all the way down. Never look back, it's time to break out!\" \"All the Way Up\" is constructed with the common verse-chorus pattern.\n\nCritical response to \"All the Way Up\" was generally mixed, with the majority of critics leaning more toward the positive side. Andrew Leahy, of allmusic, stated that \"After flirting with pop and country on her early recordings, Emily Osment underwent a rock & roll makeover for her debut EP, All the Right Wrongs.\" They also went on to state that \"Despite some fairly catchy songs, [Osment] never quite shakes [herself] free of the Disney machine: [she] embraces Auto-Tune, emphasizes overly polished production, and generally whittles away at the sharp teeth these tunes might've otherwise had. In their review of the album, absolutepunk.net stated \"All The Way Up, though upbeat, contains mundane lyrics (\u201cIts my life, it\u2019s a riot/ Come on, baby, you can\u2019t deny it\u201d), and boring pop melodies.\" They even went on to say that Oment was suffering a major identity crisis (referring to her signing with Wind-up Records instead of Hollywood Records like most Disney artist.)\nThe single did receive positive reviews as well, though. In their review of the single, sodahead.com said the song was their favorite on the album. They went on to say that the song was very \"fun\", and makes you \"wanna get up and dance!\"\n\"All the Way Up\""

Priscilla Renea wrote the song with Emanuel Kiriakou, who produced the track. The song was released in March 2011, as the lead single from the band's third album, When the Sun Goes Down (2011). According to Gomez, the song was intended to inspire people, and fire back at the \"haters\", particularly those involved in cyberbullying. \"Who Says\" marks a distinct departure in sound for the band, as it has an acoustic and organic feel, compared to their dance-pop and club-oriented previous singles.\n\"Who Says\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who appreciated its message and the change of pace for the band. The song charted in the top thirty in the United States, Canada and New Zealand, and it became their highest charting single on these charts at the time. It also reached the lower regions of European charts. \"Who Says\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It also became the act's third No. 1 Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs.

Gomez performed the song on a variety occasions including at the 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards, on Dancing with the Stars, and So Random!.\nIn 2009, the band released their debut album Kiss & Tell and quickly followed-up with 2010's A Year Without Rain. After the release of the latter, Gomez said that she was not in a rush to release another album, but after hearing \"Who Says\", she decided to begin another release, calling the song \"amazing\" and crediting it for inspiring her. Gomez would later call the song \"fun and empowering\", commenting, \"Every time I sing this song, I'm like, 'I feel better already!'\" When talking about the song's message, Gomez commented that she thought of it as \"sweet\", going on to say, \"with bullying, with cyberbullying, with all the negativity that is in high school and dealing with things, you're already trying to figure out who you are; it doesn't help when people are constantly trying to tear you down.\" She then said that she was \"dealing with it, of course\" and was \"going through it as well\". After debuting the single on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Gomez mentioned the criticism received on Twitter and Facebook due to being a celebrity.\nTwitter and Facebook are really negative for me\u00a0\u2026 within that world is such easy access to people's feelings.

Gomez herself stated \"I am so happy [about recent empowerment songs], 'cause music is a universal language, and it's a quick way to get to everybody. The fact that all these artists are doing that, it's really good. I'm really happy.\" The song was released on iTunes in the United States and Canada on March 14, 2011. It was released as a CD single in Germany on March 15, 2011, with the B-side of \"Ghost of You\" from A Year Without Rain.\nThe song is a departure in her previous singles such as \"Round & Round\" and \"Naturally\", whereas the previous were dance-pop and club-oriented, \"Who Says\" has an \"organic\" and \"acoustic\" feel. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, \"Who Says\" is set in common time in a moderate tempo of 101 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major as Gomez's vocal range spans from the low-note of G#\u2083 to the high-note of E\u2085. The song contains string accents described as \"sympathetic, but not overpowering\". Described as a \"jangly pop tune\", having an \"overarching feel-good vibe\", lyrically, the song speaks of \"embracing who you are and not letting your critics get you down\". Gomez sings of insecurities, and people telling her she is not good enough, before asserting \"I'm sure you got some things/ You'd like to change about yourself/ But when it comes to me/ I wouldn't want to be anybody else.\"\nAccording to Brian Voerding of AOL Radio Blog, \"Gomez sings about staying true to herself, particularly in the face of doubt that comes from others telling her she can't live up to her dreams\"."

It was written by Swift and its producers, Max Martin and Shellback. \"Shake It Off\" is an uptempo dance-pop song featuring a saxophone line in its production. The lyrics are about Swift's indifference to her detractors and their negative view of her image. The song was the lead single from her fifth studio album, 1989, which Swift marketed as her first pop album. It was released for digital download worldwide on August 19, 2014, by Big Machine Records.\nContemporary critics found the song's dance-pop production catchy, but some believed the lyrics were weak. Retrospectively, critics have considered \"Shake It Off\" an effective opener for the 1989 era, which transformed Swift's sound and image from country to pop. The song featured on 2010s decade-end lists by NME and Consequence. In the U.S., the single spent 50 weeks\u2013including four weeks at number one\u2013on the Billboard Hot 100, and received a Diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Shake It Off\" also topped charts in Australia, Canada, Hungary, New Zealand, and Poland.\nThe single was supported by a music video directed by Mark Romanek. The video, in which Swift portrays a clumsy person attempting to practice several dance moves without success, attracted accusations of cultural appropriation for featuring dance routines associated with people of color such as twerking. To promote the song, Swift performed on televised live events including the MTV Video Music Awards and the iHeartRadio Music Festival. She included \"Shake It Off\" on the set lists for two of her world tours, the 1989 World Tour (2015) and Reputation Stadium Tour (2018). The song has received numerous accolades, including Favorite Song at the 2015 People's Choice Awards and three Grammy nominations at the 2015 Grammy Awards.\nTaylor Swift had been known as a country singer-songwriter until her fourth studio album Red (released in October 2012), which incorporates various pop and rock styles, transcending the country sound of her previous releases. The collaborations with Swedish pop producers Max Martin and Shellback introduced straightforward pop hooks and new genres, including electronic and dubstep, to Swift's discography. Swift and her label, Big Machine, promoted it as a country album. The album's diverse musical styles sparked a media debate over her status as a country artist, to which she replied in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, \"I leave the genre labeling to other people.\" Swift began recording her fifth studio album, 1989, while touring to support Red in mid-2013. Inspired by 1980s synth-pop, she conceived 1989 as her first \"official pop\" record that would transform her image from country to pop. Martin and Shellback produced seven out of thirteen tracks for the album's standard edition, including \"Shake It Off\".\nSwift wrote \"Shake It Off\" with Martin and Shellback. The song was recorded by Sam Holland at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles and by Michael Ilbert at MXM Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. It was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound Studio in New York City.\nMusically, \"Shake It Off\" is an uptempo dance-pop song that incorporates a saxophone line. Jonas Thander, the song's saxophone player, based his part on Martin's pre-recorded MIDI horn sample, using a tenor horn. It took Thander over ten hours to edit the saxophone part, which he completed over the following day. \"Shake It Off\" follows a ii\u2013IV\u2013I chord progression; it employs a verse\u2013prechorus\u2013chorus form to begin with a loose verse, tighten for the prechorus, and loosen again for the chorus. The song's upbeat production is accompanied by a looping drum beat, a handclap-based bridge, and synthesized saxophones.\nThe lyrics of the song were inspired by the media scrutiny that Swift had experienced during her rise to stardom. In an interview with Rolling Stone in August 2014, Swift said about the song's inspiration: \"I've had every part of my life dissected ... When you live your life under that kind of scrutiny,"

Stevenson and Livermore engineered the song alongside Andrew Berlin, while Chris Lord-Alge served as the mixer.

McIlrath also saw the song as a way of expressing that the band stood by their beliefs and that they wouldn't conform.\n\"Satellite\" is a melodic hardcore song. John Fortunato of The Aquarian Weekly described the song as a \"fist-pounding mantra\", while Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic commented on how \"Satellite\" was produced to \"enhance the [album's] melodic nature\".\nLyrically, the song features several paradoxes and metaphors, such as \"You can't fill your cup, until you empty all it has\".

Chad Grischow of IGN commented on the \"melodic bliss hidden in the [song's] hammering riffs\", and noted how \"Satellite\" and fellow Endgame track \"This Is Letting Go\" make the album a \"tough resist for even those not accustomed to the staggering punk package it wraps it all up in\". Boy labeled the song an \"infectious sing-along\" and praised the track for its fiery and passionate social commentary. Ulf Kubanke of laut.de found \"Satellite\" to be a perfect pop song, praising its anti-establishment message. However, Alex Young of Consequence of Sound described the song as one of the haphazard moments from the album, while John Gentile of Punknews.org felt that some of the lyrics were clich\u00e9d and bland.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Marc Klasfeld, and was released on November 1, 2011. Filmed during numerous Endgame Tour performances, the idea for the video stemmed from the distinct reaction by fans during live performances of the song. In response, the band felt compelled to dedicate the video to their fans.

The song samples Chaka Khan's 1985 single \"Through the Fire\" and was released on the last day of September 2003 as the lead single from his debut album The College Dropout (2004).\n\"Through the Wire\" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and received positive reviews from music critics. It was certified Platinum and Gold in the United States and United Kingdom respectively. The song was nominated for a 2005 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance, but lost to Jay-Z's \"99 Problems\". The music video was financed by West, who was inspired by an Adidas advertisement. It won Video of the Year at the 2004 Source Hip Hop Awards.\nOn October 23, 2002, West was in a California recording studio producing music for Beanie Sigel, Peedi Crakk, and The Black Eyed Peas. After leaving the studio at around 3 a.m. in his rented Lexus, he had a near-fatal accident when he was cut off by a car, ran head-on into traffic, and collided with another car near the W Hotel. He was taken to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, mentioned in the song as \"the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died,\" and had his jaw wired to his face in reconstructive surgery. Two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded the song at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut. Consequence recalls West started rapping the lyrics to the song three days after the accident.\n\nThe song's title refers to the wires used to hold his broken jaw together. When asked about how the incident changed his music, West stated: \nWell, the only thing this accident's is saying is, \"I am about to hand you the world, just know at any given time I can take it away from you.\" To nearly lose your life, to nearly lose your mouth, your voice, your whole face, as a rapper...and I had to be on TV! My face looks crazy to me now... But I have to just thank God for the situation that I am in... \"Through The Wire\" is the worst thing that could've possibly happen to me, and now it's obviously the best thing. Look how it exploded!\nThe song originally appeared on West's mixtape Get Well Soon... where his wired jaw was incredibly noticeable, before being re-recorded and released as the first single from The College Dropout in late 2003. Although he initially had trouble convincing Roc-A-Fella Records executives to let him make his own album as a rapper, he was able to change their minds after the song's release.\n\"Through the Wire\" was inspired by the 2002 car accident and West has provided a comedic account of his difficult recovery. West samples a pitch-shifted and sped up version of Chaka Khan's 1985 single \"Through the Fire\". Coodie, one of the music video's directors, reported that Khan wouldn't initially allow the sample to be cleared until the video was shown to her son and he told Khan about it, leading to the sample being cleared about two weeks later. However, in June 2019, Khan criticized West's use of the sample, calling it \"stupid\". West did not receive writing credit for the song, which instead went to David Foster, Tom Keane, and Cynthia Weil, who wrote \"Through the Fire\". West's rapping is described as \"a Snoop-meets-Hova flow, twisting up his words with the patented 'izz' inflection.\"\nDave Heaton of PopMatters called it \"as riveting and moving as everyone says it is\" and it \"may be the album's most startling personal horror story (though it's also a song of hope and gratitude)\". AllMusic's Andy Kellman said it was \"a daring way to introduce himself to the masses as an MC\" and it \"couldn't have forged his dual status as underdog and champion any better.\" Kellman described the content as \"heartbreaking and hysterical\" and that despite his \"inevitable slur, his words ring loud and clear\".\nThe New York Times' Kelefa Sanneh described him as \"a wounded hero beating the odds\" and it \"gave him a chance to prove that he was the exception to the rule that producers can't rap.\" Stylus Magazine called it \"a poignant, pop-culture-packed account of Kanye\u2019s near-fatal run-in with Chaka Khan\". By rapping with his jaw sewed up, The Source noted that West used \"the element of surprise to his advantage\". HipHopDX listed the track as one of \"the classics that created\" the album's hype, and Pitchfork Media stated it was"

Written and produced by lead vocalist Jared Leto, \"Do or Die\" explores the feeling of standing up and living one's dreams using also ironic undertones. The song is styled in electronic rock and imbued with elements of arena rock. It was serviced to mainstream radio in July 2013 in Europe, and was released as a promotional single in the United States in March 2014. A version of the song remixed by Dutch music producer Afrojack was digitally released in March 2014 and later included on the deluxe edition of Afrojack's debut studio album Forget the World (2014).\n\"Do or Die\" received positive reviews from music critics, who hailed its musical diversity and its euphoric but minimalistic nature. It charted in some nations due to digital sales from the parent album. The accompanying music video, directed by Leto, features live footage of Thirty Seconds to Mars onstage as well as stories from their fans, personally interviewed by Leto. The video garnered general acclaim from critics, who lauded its atmosphere and simplicity. The song was included in the setlist of the band's Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and the subsequent Carnivores Tour.\n\"Do or Die\" was written and produced by Jared Leto. It was engineered by Jamie Reed Schefman and mixed by Serban Ghenea. John Hanes engineered it for mixing at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The song was recorded at The International Centre for the Advancement of the Arts and Sciences of Sound in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Howie Weinberg and Dan Gerbarg at Howie Weinberg Mastering. Thirty Seconds to Mars unveiled six songs from their fourth studio album Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, including \"Do or Die\", during a preview event held at the Electric Lady Studios in New York City on March 14, 2013.\n\"Do or Die\" is an electronic rock song with influences and elements from arena rock. It opens with a female voiceover introducing the song's title in the Chinese language, after which there is an electronic introduction. This is followed by the sound of guitars, drum beats and synthesizers. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Leto voicing the line, \"I will never forget the moment\". The full-throated chorus then follows, which features heavy use of synthesizers and drums. The song includes a contribution from the band's fans, credited as the Knights of the White Shadow, who provide additional vocals recorded at the band's studio.\nIn an interview with PureVolume, Leto explained that the song is \"about standing up and living out your dreams\", but also features an ironic connotation. Markos Papadatos, in his review for Digital Journal, called it an \"upbeat\" song which \"deals with one taking their own stance on their beliefs, and living life to the fullest\". In a preview of the record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse described the song by saying that the band goes \"the synthy dance route on the track's intro before fire-alarm guitars and pummeling drums roar in and smash the Korg keyboards to bits\".\n\"Do or Die\" was released as a promotional single in Europe in July 2013 through Virgin Records. The song debuted at number 98 on the Ultratip chart of Belgium's Flemish region on August 24. The following week, it jumped to number 73 and peaked at number 40 on September 21. On August 30, 2013, it debuted at number 75 on the \u00d63 Austria Top 40. In the Czech Republic, the song entered the national airplay chart at number 91 on the week ending October 20, 2013. In Slovakia, it debuted at number 67 on September 22, 2013 and eventually peaked at number 29 on January 26, 2014. Polydor Records released \"Do or Die\" in the United Kingdom on September 9, 2013. It entered the UK Rock Chart at number 38. After four weeks, the song peaked at number seven on the issue dated September 28, 2013. \"Do or Die\" was used by Major League Baseball as the theme song for the 2013 Major League Baseball Postseason.\nIn March 2014, it was announced that Dutch music producer Afrojack and Thirty Seconds to Mars had collaborated on a remixed version of the song. It became commercially available for download in March 2014 and was later included on the deluxe edition of Afrojack's debut studio album Forget the World. Leto described the collaboration by saying, \"It was a lot of fun, and it's kind of our little summer song. I think it's good to do things"

Inspired by lead vocalist Tim McIlrath's visit to New Orleans, the song is about the slow response time for aid to disaster stricken areas. It incorporates elements of punk rock and melodic hardcore, with lyrics that allude to Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. \"Help Is on the Way\" premiered on KROQ-FM on January 17, 2011, and was later released as Endgame's lead single on January 25.\n\"Help Is on the Way\" polarized critics, with some praising its lyrics and song structure, while others criticized it for being bland and repetitive. Despite the mixed reception, it remains one of the band's highest charting singles to date. It peaked at eighty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100, and reached number two on the  Hot Rock Songs chart. The accompanying music video depicts an African-American family, as they attempt to escape increasing floodwater levels that engulf their neighborhood.\n\"Help Is on the Way\" is a rock song containing elements of punk rock and melodic hardcore. John Fortunato of The Aquarian Weekly described the song as a \"menacingly anthemic, phlegm-clearing diatribe\". \"Help Is on the Way\" is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 108 beats per minute. It is composed in the key G minor, with a melody that spans a tonal range of D\u2084 to B\u266d\u2085.\nLyrically, \"Help Is on the Way\" is about the slow response time for aid to disaster stricken areas. During the first and second verses, the lyrics allude to Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, as well as their affects on the Gulf Coast of the United States and the city of New Orleans. Singer Tim McIlrath maintains clean vocals throughout the majority of the song, but temporarily switches to screaming vocals during the bridge.\nMcIlrath wrote the lyrics, which were inspired by a trip he took to New Orleans. While he had initially gone to discuss with local musicians how to merge politics with music, he was able to visit several areas affected by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flood, such as the Lower Ninth Ward. As McIlrath felt that news outlets were quick to discuss less important stories following the disaster, he compiled his thoughts and wrote the song's lyrics. McIlrath also noted his criticism of the United States government and how they handled these disasters influenced the lyrics; he called Hurricane Katrina \"as much a man-made disaster as it was a natural disaster\", and lambasted the fact that no legislation was passed to prevent another oil spill following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\"Help Is on the Way\" had its world premiere on the California radio-station KROQ-FM on January 17, 2011. It was then released on January 25, as the lead single from Rise Against's sixth album Endgame. Commercially, \"Help Is on the Way\" is one of Rise Against's most successful singles to date. In the United States, it remains the band's only song to reach the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at eighty-nine, and reached number two on the Hot Rock Songs chart. The single also achieved international success, reaching number ten on the Australia Hitseekers chart, number forty-five on the Canadian Hot 100, number four on the Czech Republic Modern Rock chart, and number nineteen on the UK Rock & Metal chart.\nCritics were polarized in their opinions when reviewing \"Help Is on the Way\". Tim Newbound of Rock Sound described the piece as \"impressively structured and equally furious\", while Evan Lucy of Billboard thought it was \"understated enough to capture radio attention and plenty explosive to please Rise Against's devoted fan base\". Rob Parker of NME felt that \"Help Is on the Way\" and fellow Endgame track \"This Is Letting Go\" were able to \"strike the perfect balance between punk fury and melodic accessibility without losing any of frontman Tim McIlrath\u2019s personality\". Chad Grischow of IGN complimented the music, saying that \"as powerful as the lyrical content of the song is, the storm of guitars rolling over it like a gristly, foreboding cloud kick you in the chest just as hard\".\nKoski and Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club were divided in their opinions, with Koski praising the powerful lyrics, while Hyden belittled the song as \"run-of-the-mill\". Thomas Nassiff of AbsolutePunk wrote that"

Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Sandy Wilhelm. \"Hush Hush\" is a song by American recording artist Alexis Jordan, taken from her self-titled debut album (2011). It was released as the album's third single on June 10, 2011. The dance-pop song was written by Autumn Rowe, Petr Brdi\u010dko, Stargate and Sandy Vee. Alexis called the song \"feisty\" and that it was a song that \"unleashes a fiery side of her personality\".\nSpeaking in May 2011 to urban writer Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul, Jordan described the lyrical background to the song: \"It's really dealing with the situation where - if you've been hurt, or someone's treated you wrong or cheated on you in a relationship - you're basically saying 'Be quiet! I don't wanna hear it! I'm gonna move ON!'... So what I particularly liked about the song is that it's a very powerful statement for anybody who's been in that kind of situation.\"\n\"Hush Hush\" is written by Autumn Rowe, Petr Brdi\u010dko, StarGate and Sandy Vee, and it was produced by Stargate and Sandy Vee. When premiering the song with Digital Spy, Jordan discussed the song. \"The thing I love about this track is that it has a dance beat that is irresistible. You can't not dance to it! It's also quite fierce and feisty, but in a fun and positive way.\" Discussing the recording process of the record, she insisted: \"It was a very calm and fun process. I was always in the studio smiling! It was something that I felt so blessed to be doing - it never felt like a chore. I am thankful to the whole team around me though, we mesh very well together.\"\n\nBBC Music described the production as \"clattery\", while praising the strength and soul in Jordan's vocals as \"empowering\". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song four stars out of five and wrote, \"\"Hush, hush, hush/ You know I'm coming for ya/ Tough, tough, tough,\" she threatens over a relentless Stargate-helmed disco riff and dance beats that pack more camp oomph than a Pineapple Dance Studios session with Louie Spence.\" 4Music's David Griffiths called the song \"another dancefloor-friendly pop track that will have you on your feet in seconds.\"\nThe song peaked at number 36 in Ireland, and 66 in the UK from strong downloads from the album, almost one month before the official release.The song peaked on number 12 in The Netherlands and that is also directly the Highest position of this single.\nThe music video for the song was uploaded to YouTube on 6 May 2011 and lasts four minutes and six seconds.

It was released by Polydor Records on 16 November 2012, as the first single from the album and the official single for Children in Need 2012. In February 2009, the group signed a new record deal with Fascination Records that would see the group release another three studio albums; however, they announced that they were taking a hiatus to pursue solo projects. In April 2012, bandmate Cheryl revealed the girls had been in talks to regroup for the group's tenth anniversary later that year. In October 2012, a countdown was activated on Girls Aloud's official website, which would last until 19 October 2012, when \"Something New\" would be premiered on radio. However the date was brought forward to 16 October 2012 following an early online leak of the track.\n\"Something New\" is a dance song produced by Girls Aloud's long-time collaborator Brian Higgins. Music critics were mostly positive towards the production, and compared it to songs by David Guetta, Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga. They also noted that the track's structure follow the group's signature style. \"Something New\" debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Girls Aloud's 16th top five hit in the country. The song also peaked inside the top five in Ireland and Scotland. The accompanying music video was directed by Ray Kay, and features a mixture of black-and-white and coloured shots of the entire group, while also showcasing each member in a separate set-up. Girls Aloud performed \"Something New\" in few programmes, such as Strictly Come Dancing and Top of the Pops, and in 2013's Ten: The Hits Tour.\nThis is the second Children in Need song that the band have released, the first being \"I'll Stand by You\" in 2004.\nIn February 2009, Girls Aloud signed a new record deal with Fascination Records that would see the group release another three studio albums. However, in July 2009, the group announced that they were taking a year-long hiatus to pursue solo projects but would reunite for a new studio album in 2010; this did not happen, however. Two months later, the hiatus was briefly interrupted when they did two shows supporting Coldplay along with Jay-Z at Wembley Stadium. In April 2012, during an interview with Chris Moyles on Radio 1, Cheryl Cole revealed the girls had been in talks to regroup for the group's tenth anniversary later that year. In August 2012, Nicola Roberts was also featured on the same radio show, and said, \"It's our tenth birthday in November so we will definitely celebrating. I wanna tell you everything but I really can't!\"\nThe comeback was confirmed when Girls Aloud's official website posted on 9 October a countdown that would last until 19 October, when the girls would make a special announcement. It was speculated that they would make an appearance on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, where bandmate Kimberley Walsh joined as a contestant. However, on 15 October, the surprise, a single titled \"Something New\", leaked online in full. The official radio premiere of the song was then brought forward to the following day, with Girls Aloud posting on their website, \"It's here! The finished version of Something New will be played on radio from midday and will also be on YouTube to listen in full.\" \"Something New\" was released on 16 November 2012 by Polydor Records through digital download, serving as the official Children in Need 2012 single. When asked about how she felt with the group being back together and the reception from the public, Walsh said, \"I'm kind of flattered people actually care if we come back or not. I think we are all quite proud that we made enough of an impact to be able to a comeback.\"\n\"Something New\" was recorded in May 2012 and produced by Girls Aloud's long-time collaborator Brian Higgins. The uptempo dance song and was written in A major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 115 beats per minute. \"Something New\" opens with Cole and Nadine Coyle chanting \"Go, girls, g-g-go, go, go / We girls gonna take control / You boys better know, know, know / We girls gonna run this show\" over a piano melody. As the chorus begins, the five girls join together and sing, \"All I want is something new / Something I can hold on to / I don\u2019t wanna talk / I just wanna dance / Baby let it drop / Catch me if you can.\" It ends with the group shouting, \"Boy"

No No No...\" is a song by British girl group Girls Aloud from their fourth studio album, Tangled Up (2007). In 2007, the group announced that they would release a new album, due in November of that year. In July 2007, it was announced that \"Sexy! No No No...\", due to be released in September, would be as the first single from Tangled Up, with a radio premiere scheduled for 20 July. The track leaked a few hours prior to the premiere. \"Sexy! No No No...\" was written by Girls Aloud and Xenomania, and is an electropunk song that incorporates a sample of Nazareth's 1975 song \"Hair of the Dog\", for which they received a writing credit. Composed of three songs welded together, the song avoids the verse-chorus form present in most contemporary pop music, similar to their previous single \"Biology\" (2005).\n\"Sexy! No No No...\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics, and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart, continuing the band's string of hits by becoming their fifteenth consecutive single to chart within the top ten. The song also peaked at number 11 on the Irish Singles Chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Trudy Bellinger, and features the group singing and dancing through pins and wires in black latex catsuits and red dresses. To promote the song, Girls Aloud performed \"Sexy! No No No...\" at Dance X, ITV1 special Saturday Night Divas and T4 on the Beach. The track was also included in three of the group's concert tours, 2008's Tangled Up Tour, 2009's Out of Control Tour and 2013's Ten: The Hits Tour.\nIn 2007, the group announced that they would release a new album in November of that year. The production and songwriting began with producer Brian Higgins meeting each member of the group individually, and discussing their life since the release of Chemistry (2005). Higgins took inspiration from these discussions in his songwriting, with bandmate Nicola Roberts explaining that \"it's important he's up to date with where we are. Our songs have to reflect us so that's why we do it.\" \"Sexy! No No No...\" was then written by Girls Aloud with production team Xenomania. Roberts, Cheryl Cole, Sarah Harding and Kimberley Walsh recorded vocals for the song in London, England, while Nadine Coyle recorded her vocals in Los Angeles, California. In July 2007, Girls Aloud announced that they would release \"Sexy! No No No...\", as the first single from Tangled Up, in September 2007. The radio premiere of the song was scheduled for the morning of 20 July 2007 on BBC Radio 1, however, it leaked in full online earlier the same day at 02:21 GMT. \"Sexy! No No No...\" was released for digital download on 31 August 2007, while it was also made available on two different CD single formats on 3 September 2007. The first disc included a live version of \"Something Kinda Ooooh\" (2006), recorded at the Bournemouth International Centre. The second CD format featured Tony Lamezma's \"Yes Yes Yes\" Mix of \"Sexy! No No No...\" and also a new track as a b-side, entitled \"Dog Without a Bone\". The b-side was originally written in 2006 in an attempt to come up with a lead single for the group's first compilation album, The Sound of Girls Aloud: The Greatest Hits, however, \"Something Kinda Ooooh\" was released instead. \"Dog Without a Bone\" was Popjustice's song of the day on 20 August 2007.\n\"Sexy! No No No...\" is an electropunk song, which consists of three songs welded together, according to journalist Peter Robinson: one with a samba rhythm, one with a sped-up sample and a breakbeat, and an intro from elsewhere. The track opens with Cole singing over a \"spooky\" instrumentation. Her vocals have been vocodered and she sings \"Cause I've been sitting back, no chance of falling / Hoping that nothing ever blows, no no / Boy, did you ever think that loving would be / Nothing more than walking me home, no no\". As the chorus begins, the song incorporates a sample from Scottish rock band Nazareth's 1975 track \"Hair of the Dog\", and the group starts singing, \"Did you tell him? No no no / Give him kisses? No no no / Whisper honey? No no no / You're delicious? Hell no\". John Murphy of musicOMH noted that \"Sexy! No No No..\" is not \"structured like a proper pop song - there's no verse-chorus-verse\".

(2004). It was released by Polydor Records on 13 September 2004, as the second single from the album. The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Tim Powell, Nick Coler, Lisa Cowling, Myra Boyle, and Shawn Lee. The instrumentation was inspired by The Smiths, and created by Powell and Coler. \"Love Machine\" is an uptempo song with elements of 1980s synthpop. The single was received favourably by contemporary music critics, who deemed it a joyful track that was different from the single releases by other artists at the time. According to research carried out for Nokia in 2006, \"Love Machine\" is the second \"most exhilarating\" song ever.\n\"Love Machine\" debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, continuing the band's string of hits by becoming their sixth consecutive single to chart within the top three. The song also peaked inside the top ten in Europe and Ireland. The accompanying music video was directed by Stuart Gosling, and portrays the five members in a nightclub/restaurant scene dancing and sipping champagne whilst singing their song. Girls Aloud performed \"Love Machine\" on all of their tours and on several live appearances, including at Disney Channel Kids Awards, TMF Awards 2005, and at The Girls Aloud Party TV special in 2008. English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys covered the song on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.\nFollowing a brief hiatus, Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania to produce Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, following the success of their debut album Sound of the Underground. Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album. He continued, saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs, however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted. The album was recorded from April to September 2004, although its lead single \"The Show\" was released in June 2004. Bandmate Nicola Roberts said that \"Love Machine\" was recorded in 18 parts over three days. Roberts also revealed that the band initially was in disagreement with Polydor regarding its release as a single, with Sarah Harding adding that all the girls wanted to release \"Deadlines & Diets\" instead. Kimberley Walsh and Nadine Coyle in particular voiced their disapproval of the single release, Coyle stating it would be \"career suicide\" and that she thought the group would be known as laughing stocks if the song came out.\nHowever, despite an \"embarrassing\" meeting between the label and the girls, \"Love Machine\" was picked as the second single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, being released on 13 September 2004. \"The pressure to come up with singles was, as always, immense. But [...] we were able to have a lot of fun working on ideas that were maybe a little too odd to be on the radio,\" Higgins said. It was released on three different CD single formats, as well as an additional 7\" picture disc, making it Girls Aloud's first single available on vinyl. The first disc included a Flip & Fill remix of \"The Show\". For the sleeve of the second CD, Artwork design group Form invented five fake magazines, one for each member, and used \"Love Machine\" lyrics as the headlines. The disc included an exclusive previously unreleased b-side entitled \"Androgynous Girls\", which had been initially considered to be released as the lead single of the album. The Gravitas Disco Mix of \"Love Machine\" was also included. The maxi-CD also included a task-based game, created by design agency Holler. The 7\" picture disc included the radio edit and Tony Lamezma Remix of \"Love Machine\".\nCheryl Cole later stated that despite her initially hating the song, that the success of the single taught the group that they were not always right regarding single decisions and that they needed to listen to their label from time to time.\n\"Love Machine\" was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Tim Powell, Nick Coler, Lisa Cowling, Myra Boyle, Shawn Lee. They came up with some of the song's lyrics by singing \"nonsense lyrics\" over a backing track, which eventually evolved into real songwords. The instrumentation track was inspired by The Smiths, and created by Powell and Coler. It is"

Inspired by her state of mind while playing Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic Cadillac Records, Beyonc\u00e9 wrote the song alongside Terius Nash and Shea Taylor; its production was handled by Taylor and Beyonc\u00e9. A throw-back to 1980s music, the uptempo R&B song exhibits style similar to that of Stevie Wonder, Huey Lewis, Whitney Houston and The Jackson 5, among others. While incorporating four key changes, Beyonc\u00e9 adopts a high range when repeating the song's chorus towards the end of the song. She sings about a person whom she can always call, even after facing grief and hard work, finally earning their love and respect. The song ends in the key of E Major.\nThe song's musical composition, as well as Beyonc\u00e9's vocals and versatility, positively surprised critics. Beyonc\u00e9 sang \"Love On Top\" live at 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, announcing her pregnancy at the end of her performance. This caused the upsurge of the song on several charts worldwide. It reached the top ten in Hungary, and the top twenty in Australia, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It also debuted and peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, thus becoming the second highest debut of Beyonc\u00e9's career as a solo artist. \"Love On Top\" remained at number one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for seven consecutive weeks, and has sold over one million copies. Beyonc\u00e9 won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \"Love On Top\" at the 55th ceremony.\nMainly inspired by the work of the American band New Edition, the accompanying music video for \"Love On Top\" shows Beyonc\u00e9 along with five male dancers, performing choreographed moves in a penthouse studio in New York City overlooking the Hudson River towards New Jersey. Critics generally commended the simplicity of the video, the wardrobe changes with every key change, and Beyonc\u00e9's youthful exuberance throughout the clip. The song was part of the singer's set lists on the residency shows 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 (2011) and Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live (2012), as well as The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013\u201314) and The Formation World Tour (2016).\n\"Love On Top\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Terius Nash and Shea Taylor while production was handled by Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor. From June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Beyonc\u00e9's official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and a quote. On June 26, 2011, \"Love On Top\" was the eighth song to be chosen. The quote found Beyonc\u00e9 elaborating on the song's inspiration:\n\"When I played Etta James [in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records] it was the most I'd learned about myself until the recording of this album. When I went into the studio I used the same passion, honesty, and approach with my vocals I channeled as Etta James. It does not sound like the vocals on my past albums. It's a lot rawer. It comes from a deep place.\"\nBeyonc\u00e9, who has covered \"At Last\" which is a song originally recorded by James, portrayed the artist in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records and won critical acclaim for her portrayal. She told Billboard magazine: \"I realized that Etta James was so unapologetic, bold and strong that playing her was a big risk for me. It gave me the confidence and the push to challenge myself a little more with my music.\" \"Love On Top\" impacted Urban radio in the United States on January 10, 2012, as the fourth single from the album in that country.\n\"Love On Top\" is an up-tempo R&B and disco song viewed as a modern take on old school music. It also exhibits elements of retro-soul music, retro-pop, 1980s pop music, funk music, jazz, and 1970s classic disco music, as stated by Joanne Dorken of MTV UK, Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun and Thomas Conner of Chicago Sun-Times. According to Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson, \"Love On Top\" is a \"bright, breezy tribute to the freshness of mid-[19]80s, pre-new-jack-FM R&B reminiscent of Whitney Houston and Anita Baker.\" He also said the song was the \"perfect and totally inverted fraternal twin\" of another song on 4, being \"Rather Die Young\". \"Love On Top\"'s retro elements are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a \"distorted\" bass groove, and a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies, especially in the bridge and the chorus of the song. It is instrumentally complete with a thumping bassline,"

Sasha Fierce (2008). The song was composed by Elvis Williams, Harold Lilly, and Beyonc\u00e9. \"Ego\" was officially remixed with additional vocals from hip hop artist, Kanye West. Initially planned to be released in January 2009 as the second urban single in the US along with the fourth US and third international single \"Halo\", the release of \"Ego\" was canceled and replaced by \"Diva\". \"Ego\" was later serviced as the third urban single, and fifth overall single in the US on May 19, 2009, alongside the sixth US and fourth international single \"Sweet Dreams\".\n\"Ego\" was originally written for singer Chrisette Michele, who turned it down. It was eventually proposed to Beyonc\u00e9 who used it for the deluxe edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. In the song, Beyonc\u00e9 sings about her love for the \"huge ego\" of her love interest. \"Ego\" was generally well received by music critics, many of whom praised the fact that Beyonc\u00e9 opted to show some of her vocal limitations in a part of the song. Critics also noted that \"Ego\" could even have been placed in either disc of I Am.. Sasha Fierce as it combines elements of both sides of Beyonc\u00e9's split musical personality. The remix version of \"Ego\" was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 52nd Grammy Awards.\n\"Ego\" became the fifth consecutive song from I Am... Sasha Fierce to reach the top 40 on US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at 39. It reached number three on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Despite not being released elsewhere, \"Ego\" reached number 11 in New Zealand and number 60 in the United Kingdom, among others. Its music video was directed by Frank Gatson, Jr, and was co-directed by Beyonc\u00e9 herself, thus becoming her directorial debut. A video was also filmed for the remix version of the song with Kanye West. \"Ego\" was a part of Beyonc\u00e9's set list on her I Am... World Tour (2009\u201310).\n\"Ego\" was written by Elvis Williams, Harold Lilly and Beyonc\u00e9 while production was handled by Williams and Beyonc\u00e9. It was originally written for singer Chrisette Michele for her 2009 album Epiphany. However, Michele turned it down because she had written all the songs on her then-upcoming album and feared that the song might not suit her. She said, \"You don't know if they're going to be able to capture your voice the same way that you captured it yourself.\" \"Ego\" was eventually proposed to Beyonc\u00e9, who used it for the deluxe edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. It was officially remixed with added vocals from Kanye West, whom Beyonc\u00e9 described as the \"perfect person\" to be on the remix. Elaborating on her collaboration with West, she told MTV News, \"[Kanye's] voice sounds so wonderful on it. He definitely has the confidence and he backs it up. And that's what this song is about.\" The remix was included on the 2009 remix album Above and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Video Collection & Dance Mixes and the platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Andrew Burgess of musicOMH criticized West's \"lackadaisical and disappointing appearance\" on the remix.\n\"Ego\" and \"Halo\" were initially planned for simultaneous release in the US, following the 2008 dual lead singles \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". However, the release of \"Ego\" was scrapped and replaced with \"Diva\". \"Ego\" was later released as the fifth US single to urban contemporary radio on May 19, 2009 and to rhythmic contemporary radio on June 2, 2009, along with \"Sweet Dreams\". It was at first supposed to be released alongside the sixth US and fourth worldwide single \"Broken-Hearted Girl\"; however, at the last minute, the release of the latter was scrapped, and \"Sweet Dreams\" was released instead. Both tracks were taken from the ... Sasha Fierce disc. This goes in contrast to the previous joint-releases from this album where one track was taken from each disc. \"Ego\" was additionally released on a digital EP as a B-side single to \"Sweet Dreams\" on July 31, 2009, in Germany.\nAccording to Beyonc\u00e9, \"Ego\" is an R&B-leaning song with a \"fun vibe\". It also incorporates influences"

It was written by Diane Warren, while production was handled by OneRepublic members Ryan Tedder and Brent Kutzle, alongside Kuk Harrell; while Beyonc\u00e9 is credited on the vocal production. \"I Was Here\" is a reflective R&B ballad, in which Beyonc\u00e9 vulnerably reviews her past, wanting to leave an impact on the world before her life comes to an end. Described as a \"career song\" by Warren, its development was motivated by the September 11 attacks in the United States.\nFollowing the release of 4, \"I Was Here\" charted at number 131 on the UK Singles Chart, 74 on the Swiss Singles Chart, and 44 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart in early July 2011. Later, in 2012, the song also appeared on several charts internationally.\nA music video for the song was released on August 19, 2012 and it features Beyonc\u00e9 performing the song live at the United Nations General Assembly while images of volunteers doing humanitarian work were projected on the screen behind her. It was donated to the World Humanitarian Day and aimed to create social media history with one billion people sharing the message of doing something good for another person. Upon its release, it received positive reviews from music critics who praised the projections, Beyonc\u00e9's vocal performance and her look.\nIn late July, the song was included on the soundtrack for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. \"I Was Here\" was also part of Beyonc\u00e9's set list for her residency show 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 and was used in the Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live shows during an interlude. The live video from the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4 appeared online on November 16, 2011 containing Beyonc\u00e9's home movies and professional highlights. \"I Was Here\" was covered by Lea Michele for Glee's soundtrack album Glee: The Music, The Graduation Album (2012).\n\"I Was Here\" was written by Diane Warren and was produced by Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Beyonc\u00e9 and Kuk Harrell. \"I Was Here\" is the only song on the record that was not co-written by Beyonc\u00e9. On June 1, 2011, Warren revealed in an interview for the New York Post's PopWrap that she wrote \"the best [song she has] ever written\" a week and a half ago and that Beyonc\u00e9 had already recorded it for her fourth studio album 4. She described it as \"a career song and probably my favorite thing I've ever written\". The development of \"I Was Here\" was motivated by the September 11 attacks. Warren wanted to work with Beyonc\u00e9 since the Destiny's Child eras, but admitted that \"I Was Here\" was the ideal timing, \"I thought that the one artist who would be my dream to sing ['I Was Here'] would be Beyonc\u00e9. This is one of those magical stories where what is meant to be actually happens.\"\nIn May 2011, Warren played the song on a guitar over the phone to Beyonc\u00e9's husband Jay-Z, who then called her. Upon hearing \"I Was Here\", Beyonc\u00e9 got chills, and immediately made up her mind, \"Oh my god, I have to have this song.\" September 2011 was going to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and Beyonc\u00e9 thought that the song would perfectly complete her album, which had nearly reached completion. The mastering of 4 was delayed to allow Beyonc\u00e9 to record the song. Warren was present at the recording sessions, which took place two days following her conversation with Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z on the phone. She said, \"There's nothing better than to hear the song that you came up with [sung back]. It's like your heart found another heart\", before adding:\nI've never had chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyonc\u00e9 sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul and became the song that was coming from hers. In all my life, I have never heard anything as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever be one of the best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.\n\"I Was Here\" is a downtempo R&B ballad that is instrumentally based on synthesizers undercurrent, indie rock guitars, musical keyboards and big drums provided by Tedder and Kutzle. The sound of the song's recurring hook uses a combination of a xylophone and a piano. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the"

Inspired by her state of mind while playing Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic Cadillac Records, Beyonc\u00e9 wrote the song alongside Terius Nash and Shea Taylor; its production was handled by Taylor and Beyonc\u00e9. A throw-back to 1980s music, the uptempo R&B song exhibits style similar to that of Stevie Wonder, Huey Lewis, Whitney Houston and The Jackson 5, among others. While incorporating four key changes, Beyonc\u00e9 adopts a high range when repeating the song's chorus towards the end of the song. She sings about a person whom she can always call, even after facing grief and hard work, finally earning their love and respect. The song ends in the key of E Major.\nThe song's musical composition, as well as Beyonc\u00e9's vocals and versatility, positively surprised critics. Beyonc\u00e9 sang \"Love On Top\" live at 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, announcing her pregnancy at the end of her performance. This caused the upsurge of the song on several charts worldwide. It reached the top ten in Hungary, and the top twenty in Australia, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It also debuted and peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, thus becoming the second highest debut of Beyonc\u00e9's career as a solo artist. \"Love On Top\" remained at number one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for seven consecutive weeks, and has sold over one million copies. Beyonc\u00e9 won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \"Love On Top\" at the 55th ceremony.\nMainly inspired by the work of the American band New Edition, the accompanying music video for \"Love On Top\" shows Beyonc\u00e9 along with five male dancers, performing choreographed moves in a penthouse studio in New York City overlooking the Hudson River towards New Jersey. Critics generally commended the simplicity of the video, the wardrobe changes with every key change, and Beyonc\u00e9's youthful exuberance throughout the clip. The song was part of the singer's set lists on the residency shows 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 (2011) and Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live (2012), as well as The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013\u201314) and The Formation World Tour (2016).\n\"Love On Top\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Terius Nash and Shea Taylor while production was handled by Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor. From June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Beyonc\u00e9's official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and a quote. On June 26, 2011, \"Love On Top\" was the eighth song to be chosen. The quote found Beyonc\u00e9 elaborating on the song's inspiration:\n\"When I played Etta James [in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records] it was the most I'd learned about myself until the recording of this album. When I went into the studio I used the same passion, honesty, and approach with my vocals I channeled as Etta James. It does not sound like the vocals on my past albums. It's a lot rawer. It comes from a deep place.\"\nBeyonc\u00e9, who has covered \"At Last\" which is a song originally recorded by James, portrayed the artist in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records and won critical acclaim for her portrayal. She told Billboard magazine: \"I realized that Etta James was so unapologetic, bold and strong that playing her was a big risk for me. It gave me the confidence and the push to challenge myself a little more with my music.\" \"Love On Top\" impacted Urban radio in the United States on January 10, 2012, as the fourth single from the album in that country.\n\"Love On Top\" is an up-tempo R&B and disco song viewed as a modern take on old school music. It also exhibits elements of retro-soul music, retro-pop, 1980s pop music, funk music, jazz, and 1970s classic disco music, as stated by Joanne Dorken of MTV UK, Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun and Thomas Conner of Chicago Sun-Times. According to Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson, \"Love On Top\" is a \"bright, breezy tribute to the freshness of mid-[19]80s, pre-new-jack-FM R&B reminiscent of Whitney Houston and Anita Baker.\" He also said the song was the \"perfect and totally inverted fraternal twin\" of another song on 4, being \"Rather Die Young\". \"Love On Top\"'s retro elements are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a \"distorted\" bass groove, and a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies, especially in the bridge and the chorus of the song. It is instrumentally complete with a thumping bassline,"

It was written by Carey, Bryan-Michael Cox, Adonis Shropshire and Kendrick Dean, and produced by the former two. \"I Stay in Love\" was released through Island Records on October 28, 2008, as the fourth and final single from the album.  Drawing influence from the R&B music genre, the song features a piano and keyboard-driven melody, and a strong accompanying drum-beat. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting \"her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track.\" She describes the old time she shared with her love interest. She narrates that even though they said let go, and that she is aware that there is nothing left in their relationship, she still \"stays in love with him\".\n\"I Stay in Love\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many considering the song a strong ballad and a highlight from the album, while complimenting its production and piano-driven melody, despite criticizing the similarities to Carey's previous single, \"We Belong Together\" (2005). The song performed weak commercially, becoming Carey's first single from the album to not chart on the US Billboard Hot 100, although peaking at number eighty-one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and becoming Carey's fourteenth number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. In the United Kingdom, the song debuted and peaked at number ninety-five, and spent only one week on the UK Singles Chart.\nCarey performed \"I Stay in Love\" live on two high-profile televised events. First, on November 8, 2008, she was featured as a guest judge and musical performer of the fifth season of the popular British talent competition, The X Factor. Additionally, Carey performed it live at the American Music Awards, held on November 23, 2008. The song's accompanying music video was filmed by Carey's husband, Nick Cannon, and features Carey as a dancer in a Las Vegas show at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino Resort. Additionally, during the show and its preparations, Carey realizes that her ex-lover has found love with one of her fellow dancers, leading her to blow up the car he gave her, as well as its accompaniments in the Mojave Desert.\n\"I Stay in Love\" was written and produced by Mariah Carey and Bryan-Michael Cox, with additional songwriting from Adonis Shropshire and Kendrick Dean, for Carey's eleventh studio album, E=MC\u00b2 (2008). Carey produced the track for Maroon Entertainment and by Cox for Blabby Inc. Copyright is held by Rye Songs which is administered by Songs of Universal (BMI)/W.B.M. Music Corp. O/D/O itself and Songs in the key of B Flat/Noontime South/EMI Foray Music O/B/O itself and Phoenix Ave. Publishing/Christian Combs Publishing (SESAC). The song was recorded by Brian Garten at Stone Groove Studios in New York, and mixed by Phil Tan for Riotproof Productions, Inc. All instrumentation was performed by Cox, while Carey sung all the lead and background vocals. In an interview with Ed Lover for the radio station Power 105 in New York City, Carey revealed that the song was one of her favorites from the album and that she recorded her vocals within a day. Following the commercial underperformance of the album's third single, \"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\", \"I Stay in Love\" was released as the fourth single from E=MC\u00b2. In the United States, it was serviced to mainstream, rhythmic and urban radio stations on October 28, 2008. A four-track EP consisting of remixes by Jody den Broeder and Ralphi Rosario was released in the United States on December 16, 2008.\n\"I Stay in Love\" is a \"beat-driven\" and \"piano-laced\" ballad, that is influenced by pop and R&B music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. It is composed in the key of D\u266d major, with Carey's vocals spanning from the low note of D\u266d\u2083 to the high note of G\u266d\u2085. The song moves at a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute in cut time, and it follows a chord progression of D\u266d\u2013B\u266dm7\u2013G\u266d\u2013A\u266d.  The song features a \"double voice\" effect during its final chorus, where Carey's normal singing tone throughout the rest of the song is combined with her raised pitch. She raises the pitch one octave, and layers it over her normal tone. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting \"her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track.\" She describes the old time she shared with her lover. She also admits that even though they did attempt to save their relationship,"

Inspired by her state of mind while playing Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic Cadillac Records, Beyonc\u00e9 wrote the song alongside Terius Nash and Shea Taylor; its production was handled by Taylor and Beyonc\u00e9. A throw-back to 1980s music, the uptempo R&B song exhibits style similar to that of Stevie Wonder, Huey Lewis, Whitney Houston and The Jackson 5, among others. While incorporating four key changes, Beyonc\u00e9 adopts a high range when repeating the song's chorus towards the end of the song. She sings about a person whom she can always call, even after facing grief and hard work, finally earning their love and respect. The song ends in the key of E Major.\nThe song's musical composition, as well as Beyonc\u00e9's vocals and versatility, positively surprised critics. Beyonc\u00e9 sang \"Love On Top\" live at 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, announcing her pregnancy at the end of her performance. This caused the upsurge of the song on several charts worldwide. It reached the top ten in Hungary, and the top twenty in Australia, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It also debuted and peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, thus becoming the second highest debut of Beyonc\u00e9's career as a solo artist. \"Love On Top\" remained at number one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for seven consecutive weeks, and has sold over one million copies. Beyonc\u00e9 won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \"Love On Top\" at the 55th ceremony.\nMainly inspired by the work of the American band New Edition, the accompanying music video for \"Love On Top\" shows Beyonc\u00e9 along with five male dancers, performing choreographed moves in a penthouse studio in New York City overlooking the Hudson River towards New Jersey. Critics generally commended the simplicity of the video, the wardrobe changes with every key change, and Beyonc\u00e9's youthful exuberance throughout the clip. The song was part of the singer's set lists on the residency shows 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 (2011) and Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live (2012), as well as The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013\u201314) and The Formation World Tour (2016).\n\"Love On Top\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Terius Nash and Shea Taylor while production was handled by Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor. From June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Beyonc\u00e9's official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and a quote. On June 26, 2011, \"Love On Top\" was the eighth song to be chosen. The quote found Beyonc\u00e9 elaborating on the song's inspiration:\n\"When I played Etta James [in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records] it was the most I'd learned about myself until the recording of this album. When I went into the studio I used the same passion, honesty, and approach with my vocals I channeled as Etta James. It does not sound like the vocals on my past albums. It's a lot rawer. It comes from a deep place.\"\nBeyonc\u00e9, who has covered \"At Last\" which is a song originally recorded by James, portrayed the artist in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records and won critical acclaim for her portrayal. She told Billboard magazine: \"I realized that Etta James was so unapologetic, bold and strong that playing her was a big risk for me. It gave me the confidence and the push to challenge myself a little more with my music.\" \"Love On Top\" impacted Urban radio in the United States on January 10, 2012, as the fourth single from the album in that country.\n\"Love On Top\" is an up-tempo R&B and disco song viewed as a modern take on old school music. It also exhibits elements of retro-soul music, retro-pop, 1980s pop music, funk music, jazz, and 1970s classic disco music, as stated by Joanne Dorken of MTV UK, Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun and Thomas Conner of Chicago Sun-Times. According to Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson, \"Love On Top\" is a \"bright, breezy tribute to the freshness of mid-[19]80s, pre-new-jack-FM R&B reminiscent of Whitney Houston and Anita Baker.\" He also said the song was the \"perfect and totally inverted fraternal twin\" of another song on 4, being \"Rather Die Young\". \"Love On Top\"'s retro elements are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a \"distorted\" bass groove, and a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies, especially in the bridge and the chorus of the song.

It was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Scott Storch and Robert Waller and produced by Storch with guitar played by musician Aaron Fishbein. Beyonc\u00e9 decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song as the third single; the song was sent by Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 19, 2003. \"Me, Myself and I\" is an R&B song about dealing with a philandering partner and learning from the consequences.\nThe live performance of the song from The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience Live was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 2009, and the original version earned Beyonc\u00e9, Storch and Waller an ASCAP Pop Music Award. \"Me, Myself and I\" peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Beyonc\u00e9's fourth consecutive top-five single in the United States.

She stated that it was more personal than her previous records because she only had to write for herself. She contacted various musical collaborators, including Storch and Waller. The musical style of \"Me, Myself and I\" is different from the style of her previous singles; Beyonc\u00e9 decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song for the next single. Following the release of the song, Beyonc\u00e9 told Corey Moss of MTV News: \"['Me, Myself and I'] is really powerful. It talks about women basically listening to their inner voice and knowing that they will never disappoint themselves.\"\n\"Me, Myself and I\" was the third single released from Dangerously in Love, which followed \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". It was sent to rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio on October 19, 2003.

Columbia Records released it as the album's fourth and final single on June 6, 2005. The song was written by band members Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams along with Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, Ricky \"Ric Rude\" Lewis and Robert Waller, with Beyonc\u00e9, Rude and Jerkins handling its production. An R&B ballad talking about a woman's desire to cater to the male love interest of her life, \"Cater 2 U\" contains synthesizers in its instrumentation. A lawsuit filled by singer-songwriter Rickey Allen in 2006 claimed the group only recorded a cover of the song which was originally his; however the case was settled in 2009.\n\"Cater 2 U\" received mixed reviews from music critics who, despite generally praising its composition and the group members' vocal performances, criticized the lyrical content. The song was nominated in two categories at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006 and received an award for Best R&B/Soul Single, Group, Band or Duo at the 2006 Soul Train Music Awards. \"Cater 2 U\" was commercially successful in the US, peaking at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, further receiving a gold certification. The song also appeared in the top ten in New Zealand and top twenty in Australia, while also receiving minor chart placement in Belgium and Netherlands.\nA music video for the song was filmed by Jake Nava and shot at the Red Rock Canyon State Park in California. It features the trio at a desert with each member singing at a separate set and later a choreographed dance during the chorus. To further promote \"Cater 2 U\", Destiny's Child performed the song during several televised appearances and at the 2005 BET Awards. In addition, \"Cater 2 U\" was added to the set list of Destiny's Child's final tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It in 2005. Both Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland performed the song during their solo tours after Destiny's Child's disbandment. A cover version of \"Cater 2 U\" was performed by Usher and Babyface at the 2005 World Music Awards as a tribute to the group due to their disbandment that followed the same year.\n\"Cater 2 U\" was written by band members Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams along with Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, Ricky \"Ric Rude\" Lewis and Robert Waller. The production was handled by Beyonc\u00e9, Rude and Jerkins with the band members also serving as the vocal producers. The song was recorded in 2004 at Sony Music Studios in New York City with guidance from Jeff Villanueva and Jim Caruna. The audio mixing was done by Tony Maserati while the mastering was finished by Tom Coyne.\nDuring an interview with MTV News, Beyonc\u00e9 talked about the meaning of the song: \"It basically talks about how a guy inspires you... You want to make him happy and you want to cater to him. I know it's going to be surprising to a lot of people that the independent survivors are being submissive to their man, but it's important that people know that, you know, it's fine if your man deserves it and gives that back to you.\" \"Cater 2 U\" was released as the fourth and final single from Destiny Fulfilled. It was added to US radio on June 6, 2005, and was released in the US as an extended play (EP) consisting of the audio version of the song along with four remixes on June 14, 2005. On July 19, another EP was released containing the original version and six remixes. Six days later, an extended play of the single was released in Italy. \"Cater 2 U\" was included on two of Destiny's Child's compilation albums: the greatest hits album #1's (2005) and Love Songs (2013).\nChicago-based singer-songwriter Rickey Allen pushed allegations that \"Cater 2 U\" was inspired by a song he had composed with the same title and spelling, which was copyrighted in the mid-1990s and 2000 and performed locally during that time. He claimed he handed over a version to producer Maurice Joshua, who allegedly went on to cover the song with Destiny's Child. Joshua denied his claims, noting that he never held a copy of Allen's song. Allen filed a lawsuit against the group for compensation in a Chicago, Illinois court in 2006 where the trio was due to appear in December 10 for an eight-day trial. However, they managed to avoid any given court dates after their public split in 2005 and agreed to settle behind closed doors. In early December 2009 it was confirmed by Chicago Sun-Times that the"

Inspired by her state of mind while playing Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic Cadillac Records, Beyonc\u00e9 wrote the song alongside Terius Nash and Shea Taylor; its production was handled by Taylor and Beyonc\u00e9. A throw-back to 1980s music, the uptempo R&B song exhibits style similar to that of Stevie Wonder, Huey Lewis, Whitney Houston and The Jackson 5, among others. While incorporating four key changes, Beyonc\u00e9 adopts a high range when repeating the song's chorus towards the end of the song. She sings about a person whom she can always call, even after facing grief and hard work, finally earning their love and respect. The song ends in the key of E Major.\nThe song's musical composition, as well as Beyonc\u00e9's vocals and versatility, positively surprised critics. Beyonc\u00e9 sang \"Love On Top\" live at 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, announcing her pregnancy at the end of her performance. This caused the upsurge of the song on several charts worldwide. It reached the top ten in Hungary, and the top twenty in Australia, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It also debuted and peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, thus becoming the second highest debut of Beyonc\u00e9's career as a solo artist. \"Love On Top\" remained at number one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for seven consecutive weeks, and has sold over one million copies. Beyonc\u00e9 won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \"Love On Top\" at the 55th ceremony.\nMainly inspired by the work of the American band New Edition, the accompanying music video for \"Love On Top\" shows Beyonc\u00e9 along with five male dancers, performing choreographed moves in a penthouse studio in New York City overlooking the Hudson River towards New Jersey. Critics generally commended the simplicity of the video, the wardrobe changes with every key change, and Beyonc\u00e9's youthful exuberance throughout the clip. The song was part of the singer's set lists on the residency shows 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 (2011) and Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live (2012), as well as The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013\u201314) and The Formation World Tour (2016).\n\"Love On Top\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Terius Nash and Shea Taylor while production was handled by Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor. From June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Beyonc\u00e9's official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and a quote. On June 26, 2011, \"Love On Top\" was the eighth song to be chosen. The quote found Beyonc\u00e9 elaborating on the song's inspiration:\n\"When I played Etta James [in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records] it was the most I'd learned about myself until the recording of this album. When I went into the studio I used the same passion, honesty, and approach with my vocals I channeled as Etta James. It does not sound like the vocals on my past albums. It's a lot rawer. It comes from a deep place.\"\nBeyonc\u00e9, who has covered \"At Last\" which is a song originally recorded by James, portrayed the artist in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records and won critical acclaim for her portrayal. She told Billboard magazine: \"I realized that Etta James was so unapologetic, bold and strong that playing her was a big risk for me. It gave me the confidence and the push to challenge myself a little more with my music.\" \"Love On Top\" impacted Urban radio in the United States on January 10, 2012, as the fourth single from the album in that country.\n\"Love On Top\" is an up-tempo R&B and disco song viewed as a modern take on old school music. It also exhibits elements of retro-soul music, retro-pop, 1980s pop music, funk music, jazz, and 1970s classic disco music, as stated by Joanne Dorken of MTV UK, Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun and Thomas Conner of Chicago Sun-Times. According to Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson, \"Love On Top\" is a \"bright, breezy tribute to the freshness of mid-[19]80s, pre-new-jack-FM R&B reminiscent of Whitney Houston and Anita Baker.\" He also said the song was the \"perfect and totally inverted fraternal twin\" of another song on 4, being \"Rather Die Young\". \"Love On Top\"'s retro elements are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a \"distorted\" bass groove, and a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies, especially in the bridge and the chorus of the song. It is instrumentally complete with a thumping bassline,"

Eriksen\nTor Erik Hermansen\nBeyonc\u00e9 Knowles. \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00e9 for her 2008 double album I Am... Sasha Fierce. Written by Beyonc\u00e9, Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, and production duo Stargate, it was initially a classic rhythm and blues song until Babyface changed the arrangement and chords. The track appears on the I Am... disc, the songs on which give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyonc\u00e9's life stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. It is a midtempo R&B ballad accompanied by piano, strings, and drum machine beats. The lyrics describe heartache and the insecurities of love.\nThe song was initially announced as the sixth single from I Am... Sasha Fierce in the United States and the fourth elsewhere, but was replaced with \"Sweet Dreams\". Columbia Records released \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" outside the US on August\u00a028, 2009. Critics praised Beyonc\u00e9's emotional vocals on the track but had divided opinions on the production. The single reached the top twenty on the singles charts of Australia, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Ireland. Sophie Muller directed a monochrome music video in which Beyonc\u00e9's character reminisces about her relationship on a beach in Malibu, California. Beyonc\u00e9 performed \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" on the I Am... World Tour (2009\u201310).\nBeyonc\u00e9 wrote \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" alongside the Norwegian production team Stargate, which consists of Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen. The duo initially composed \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" as a traditional rhythm and blues song but co-writer Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds changed one chord and added falsetto vocals. His recording a demo version preceded a rewrite of the backing track chords and the addition of a four-on-the-floor piano; the result was a \"grand-piano ballad\". According to the sheet music published by EMI, \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" was composed at a tempo of 84\u00a0beats per minute using common time in the key of D minor. Eriksen explained, \"I suppose many of our songs are in minor keys. We probably lean towards more a moody, melodic expression. It's what comes most natural for us.\"\nStargate and Beyonc\u00e9 produced \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" in 2008 at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City. Beyonc\u00e9 arranged & performed the vocals, which Jim Caruana recorded. Eriksen assisted in recording the instrumental track &, along with Hermansen, arranged the music & played the instruments. Mark \"Spike\" Stent and Matt Green then mixed the track. \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" is included on the double album I Am... Sasha Fierce as part of the I Am... disc, which features ballads that describe Beyonc\u00e9's insecurities about love and depict the person she is \"underneath all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama\". Beyonc\u00e9 said she likes to sing ballads because \"the music and the emotion in the story is told  [sic] so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. [On the I Am disc,] I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear what I had to say.\"\n\"Broken-Hearted Girl\" is a midtempo R&B ballad with an airy vocal melody. Beyonc\u00e9's vocals are accompanied by strings, a drum machine beat and a cascading melancholy piano that opens the song. The ballad has a Dm\u2013B\u266d\u2013F(add9)\u2013F\u2013C/E chord progression and a verse-chorus structure. Beyonc\u00e9 sings the introduction in a low vocal register that heightens her vocal power; in the song, her voice ranges from F\u2083 to F\u2085.\nAccording to Beyonc\u00e9, the lyrics of \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" concern a woman's fear of the downsides of love. The protagonist sings about heartache, and the possibility of a breakup due to the decline of her relationship with an unfaithful lover. She wishes that she did not have to experience this emotional hurt. While her lover is out cheating on her, at home the woman wonders if she has the courage to continue the relationship, \"now that her rock has turned out to be made of mud\", as interpreted by Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music.\nThe protagonist accepts that her feelings for her lover are too strong, and that she does not have the courage to leave him. She decides to fight for her love"

Sasha Fierce (2008). The track was released as the eighth single from the album on September 22, 2009. A remixed version featuring Lady Gaga was released on November 17, 2009. Musically, the song consists of simple lyrics and hidden innuendos, with Gaga and Beyonc\u00e9 trading verses with each other in the song's remix. The lyrics refer to putting up a sexy display to be recorded on a video phone.\nThe song received generally mixed reviews from most music critics. Some noted that Gaga's featured appearance in the song's remix failed to add anything to the tune. The original version charted in the lower regions of the charts of Australia and its urban music chart, Spain, the United Kingdom and on the R&B charts in the United States. The remixed version charted at number sixty-five on the US Billboard Hot 100, and topped the Dance Club Songs chart in the country. The remix also charted in Australia and its urban music chart, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand, while it bubbled under the main music charts of Belgium.\nA music video was created to accompany the remix featuring Gaga. It portrayed her and Knowles in a number of costumes, brandishing colorful guns towards men and paying homage to the film Reservoir Dogs (1992) and pin-up legend Bettie Page. It received mixed feedback from critics, who called it un-interesting, and felt that it did not present anything new. However, they complimented the costumes and the cinematic homage of the video. In the United States, the video went on to win the BET award for Video of the Year.\n\"Video Phone\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Shondrae Crawford, Sean Garrett and Lady Gaga in the remixed version. It was produced by Bangladesh, The Pen and Knowles. Initially, \"Video Phone\" was sent to US urban contemporary radios on September 22, 2009. The release was later recalled and in October 2009, Life & Style reported that Knowles and pop singer Lady Gaga were collaborating for a remixed version of the song. The remixed version featured both Knowles and Lady Gaga trading verses with one another. The remixed version of the song that features Lady Gaga was included on the 2009 deluxe edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce.\nMusically, \"Video Phone\" is a crunk song. According to the sheet music published at Sheetmusicplus.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate groove tempo of 120 beats per minute and in the key of Eb minor. It consists of simple lyrics, with hidden innuendos, and is backed by thin-spread beats; Knowles and Gaga uttering gasps and groans while singing the song. Chris Willman from Yahoo! said that the lyrics are a \"celebration of Skype sex and putting on a solo show, on camera, for a guy you just met at the club.\"\nThe female protagonist sings how she will dance for a man, while he is filming her with his videophone, this being illustrated in the line, \"Press 'record' and I'll let you film me\", and \"You want me naked? If you like this position you can tape it\". According to James Reed of The Boston Globe the lines \"What? You want me naked/ If you likin' this position, you can tape it\" are sung with an accent which was \"part Long Island, part Barbados\". Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club commented that \"Video Phone\" is very similar to Missy Elliott's songs. Rolling Stone's Christian Hoard and The Washington Post's J. Freedom du Lac found similarities between \"Video Phone\" and the songs by rock band Nine Inch Nails. San Francisco Chronicle's Aidin Vaziri noted that the song sounded like it was swiped from Bj\u00f6rk.\nThe song received mixed reviews.  Alexis Petridis from The Guardian compared the song to \"Diva\", stating that \"Video Phone\" is \"Almost equally weird, but much better, [and it] introduces us to the unlikely figure of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, amateur pornographer: 'You want me naked?

Inspired by her state of mind while playing Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic Cadillac Records, Beyonc\u00e9 wrote the song alongside Terius Nash and Shea Taylor; its production was handled by Taylor and Beyonc\u00e9. A throw-back to 1980s music, the uptempo R&B song exhibits style similar to that of Stevie Wonder, Huey Lewis, Whitney Houston and The Jackson 5, among others. While incorporating four key changes, Beyonc\u00e9 adopts a high range when repeating the song's chorus towards the end of the song. She sings about a person whom she can always call, even after facing grief and hard work, finally earning their love and respect. The song ends in the key of E Major.\nThe song's musical composition, as well as Beyonc\u00e9's vocals and versatility, positively surprised critics. Beyonc\u00e9 sang \"Love On Top\" live at 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, announcing her pregnancy at the end of her performance. This caused the upsurge of the song on several charts worldwide. It reached the top ten in Hungary, and the top twenty in Australia, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It also debuted and peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, thus becoming the second highest debut of Beyonc\u00e9's career as a solo artist. \"Love On Top\" remained at number one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for seven consecutive weeks, and has sold over one million copies. Beyonc\u00e9 won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \"Love On Top\" at the 55th ceremony.\nMainly inspired by the work of the American band New Edition, the accompanying music video for \"Love On Top\" shows Beyonc\u00e9 along with five male dancers, performing choreographed moves in a penthouse studio in New York City overlooking the Hudson River towards New Jersey. Critics generally commended the simplicity of the video, the wardrobe changes with every key change, and Beyonc\u00e9's youthful exuberance throughout the clip. The song was part of the singer's set lists on the residency shows 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 (2011) and Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live (2012), as well as The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013\u201314) and The Formation World Tour (2016).\n\"Love On Top\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Terius Nash and Shea Taylor while production was handled by Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor. From June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Beyonc\u00e9's official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and a quote. On June 26, 2011, \"Love On Top\" was the eighth song to be chosen. The quote found Beyonc\u00e9 elaborating on the song's inspiration:\n\"When I played Etta James [in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records] it was the most I'd learned about myself until the recording of this album. When I went into the studio I used the same passion, honesty, and approach with my vocals I channeled as Etta James. It does not sound like the vocals on my past albums. It's a lot rawer. It comes from a deep place.\"\nBeyonc\u00e9, who has covered \"At Last\" which is a song originally recorded by James, portrayed the artist in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records and won critical acclaim for her portrayal. She told Billboard magazine: \"I realized that Etta James was so unapologetic, bold and strong that playing her was a big risk for me. It gave me the confidence and the push to challenge myself a little more with my music.\" \"Love On Top\" impacted Urban radio in the United States on January 10, 2012, as the fourth single from the album in that country.\n\"Love On Top\" is an up-tempo R&B and disco song viewed as a modern take on old school music. It also exhibits elements of retro-soul music, retro-pop, 1980s pop music, funk music, jazz, and 1970s classic disco music, as stated by Joanne Dorken of MTV UK, Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun and Thomas Conner of Chicago Sun-Times. According to Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson, \"Love On Top\" is a \"bright, breezy tribute to the freshness of mid-[19]80s, pre-new-jack-FM R&B reminiscent of Whitney Houston and Anita Baker.\" He also said the song was the \"perfect and totally inverted fraternal twin\" of another song on 4, being \"Rather Die Young\". \"Love On Top\"'s retro elements are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a \"distorted\" bass groove, and a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies, especially in the bridge and the chorus of the song.

The song serves as the fifth international single from the album, and was released in Australia on January 29, 2010, in the United Kingdom on March 15 and in the United States on May 11. The song peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming the fifth top ten hit from the album.\nCo-produced by French DJ/producer David Guetta, the song heavily samples from Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's \"It Takes Two\", making use of the line \"I wanna rock right now\" multiple times, as well as the drum break, and part of the \"Yeah! Woo!\" line. The Black Eyed Peas use Auto-Tune throughout the song, and Fergie's voice has been notably high-pitched. Spin described \"Rock That Body\" as \"trance-y\". The song is most known to critics as a robotic party track on the album. The song has been compared to be stylistically similar to Flo Rida, whose song \"Club Can't Handle Me\" (from the motion picture Step Up 3D) Guetta would later go on to produce.\nFraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog gave \"Rock That Body\" three out of five stars and called it \"a party banger\". \"Rock That Body\" was well-reviewed by Mike Schiller of PopMatters. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating: \"It's got plenty of pounding beats, synths that sound like they've been filled with Red Bull and more twisted vocal effects than an mp3 of Akon cutting loose in a vocoder factory. It's pretty simple stuff and it will no doubt grate something rotten on the 36th listen...\"\nThe song was a success, reaching the top ten in many countries and top twenty in a number of others, too. \nOn the US Billboard Hot 100, the song peaked at number nine, making it their fifth consecutive top ten hit. For airplay, it proved to be their lowest-charting song since non-single \"Gone Going\" from their fourth studio album Monkey Business (2005), released to radio stations in early 2006.\nThe video was filmed on January 13, 2010, at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California. Directed by Rich Lee, it was shot back to back with the video for \"Imma Be\", the fourth song on The E.N.D. The two songs were mashed up into a medley, which is titled \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\". The medley length is 8:15 and the music video in total is 10:21. It premiered on Vevo and Dipdive on Tuesday, February 16, 2010. The videos were separated for music channels with the introduction and conclusion removed. The video is described as a futuristic Wizard of Oz. It is the sequel for the \"Imma Be\" video and the second half of the \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\" video. It begins with the Black Eyed Peas and their good robot arriving at a city, the people in the city are stuck in a glitch. The 4 members of the group shoot them with their stereo-guns to end their loop so they could continue dancing. As things are going well, the bad robot appears and kidnaps Fergie, will.i.am chases after it with his own robot while Fergie fights the bad robot and the other two members free the remaining people. After many failed attempts, will.i.am manages to shoot the bad robot, which starts dancing with the good robot. The video ends as the bad robot runs out of energy and faints. The \"Imma Be Rocking That Body\" video closes with a scene which reveals the entire story to be Fergie's dream as the other members find her barely conscious following her motorcycle accident in the introduction. As they check to see if she is okay, Fergie excitedly begins to tell them of her idea for their next music video.\nUK CD Single\nDigital Download E.P.\nSongwriting - will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, Fergie, David Guetta, Mark Knight, Adam Walder, Jean Baptiste, Jamie Munson, Robert Ginyard\nVocals - will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, Fergie\nProduction - David Guetta, will.i.am, Mark Knight, Funkagenda\nKeyboards - Mark Night, Adam Walder, will.i.am\nGuitar, additional keyboards, additional vocals - Hal Ritson\nArrangement - will.i.am\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n\nList of number-one dance hits of 2010 (UK)\nFMQB: Radio Industry News, Music Industry Updates, Arbitron Ratings, Music News and more!\n[14339,93949]\nGill, Andy (June 12, 2009). \"Album: The Black Eyed Peas, The E.N.D.

It was released on June 9, 2014, and was made available for digital download on Amazon and iTunes on June 10. The single reached number one on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, making it the band's seventh number one single on the chart.\nIn an interview with the Pulse of Radio, and regarding how the single came together, lead singer Sully Erna revealed that it was written in about an hour, stating, \"It's one of those songs that surprisingly came out and was written from back to front in, like, an hour. I started putting one thing together with the next, and then Shannon Larkin started jumping in and then we arranged the whole song, and literally within an hour, maybe 90 minutes, this whole song was written and it was one of the last songs that we wrote, and it ended up becoming the first single.\"\nWhen interviewed by Full Metal Jackie, Erna offered additional details as how the single came to be, stating, \"We had been working on stuff that we had on our own and brought in. I go, 'You know what? We haven\u2019t wrote anything yet, I'm just going to write a song real quick before TC gets back from dinner.' Tony, kidding around, said, 'You should make it a real fast riff because he'll be right back.' So I started playing really fast and then all of a sudden, I was like, 'Hold on. I have something going here.' I started hearing the different movements in the chords and it just started to feel like it was coming together. Then all of a sudden, within 90 minutes the whole song kind of wrote itself.\"\nIn the same interview with the Pulse of Radio, Erna revealed that the working title for the single was \"100,000 Horsepower\", but he felt he needed to change it, explaining, \"Actually, the original title I wanted to put on the song was '100,000 Horsepower'. But unfortunately, rhythmically, it was too many syllables and I couldn't make it fit the way I wanted to creatively, so I trimmed it back to '1000 Horsepower', which is still pretty fuckin' powerful, by the way.\"\nDigital single\nOn August 12, the music video for 1000hp premiered on Shazam, a commercial smartphone-based music identification service. One day later, it premiered on Godsmack's official Vevo channel.\nOn August 4, Godsmack took the stage at the iHeartRadio Theater in New York City as part of the iHeartRadio Live Series for an intimate live performance. The show, which was streamed online, saw the band perform 1000hp live for the first time.\n\nARTISTdirect reviewer Rick Florino gave the song a favorable review and described it as a \"bombastic Boston bruiser of epic proportions\" and that \"all of the hallmarks of the band's patented sound remain intact.\" Florino concluded his review by saying, \"It's the kind of tune you could hear at sports events and during high-octane action movie set pieces for years to come. It's exactly how real rock should sound in 2014, and it's one of the best singles of the year.\" A less favorable review came from Shelly Barclay of AXS, who felt that the song was not on a par with the band's other singles, stating, \"The song does not have the same guttural edge as songs like 'Keep Away'.\" However, she went on to say that the song \"holds its own in the band's library of rock tunes.\"\nUpon its release, \"1000hp\" entered both the Billboard Mainstream Rock and Hot Rock Songs charts, peaking at number one and twenty-two, respectively. \"1000hp\" also debuted at number one on the U.S. iTunes Rock Chart.\n\n\n\nGodsmack\nSully Erna \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, producer\nTony Rombola \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals\nRobbie Merrill \u2013 bass guitar\nShannon Larkin \u2013 drums, percussion\nTechnical personnel\nDave Fortman \u2013 production, mixing\n\"Godsmack: '1000hp' Single Premiere\".

It was written by Pink and Kara DioGuardi, with additional writing by Nate \"Danja\" Hills and Marcella Araica, while production was done by Danja, Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry. The song was released as the album's second single on October 31, 2008, firstly through digital download and later was added to U.S. radio stations on December 1, 2008. The power pop song talks about the quiet sense of comfort in being sober, with the singer claiming it was about the vices that we choose.\nThe song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended the track for being a heartfelt track, with some praising its lyrical content. However, few critics dismissed the track, calling it \"more of the same\" from her previous music. Furthermore, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 2010. Commercially, \"Sober\" attained success on the charts, reaching the top-ten in over thirteen countries, while reaching the top-twenty in the U.S., as well as the top of Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart. A music video for the track was directed by Jonas Akerlund and it finds Pink at a party with her doppelg\u00e4nger.\nIn February 2008, Pink announced that she and her husband Carey Hart had separated, which led the singer to write songs for a new album. It was confirmed that she was working with many music producers such as Butch Walker, Billy Mann, Eg White and Danja. While working on the album, she penned a track called \"Sober\" with Kara DioGuardi, claiming it was \"about the vices that we choose.\" She added, \"I had this idea in my head, 'like how do I feel this good sober?' So I brought that idea to Danja and with this awesome girl Kara DioGuardi and we wrote this song, Sober. And it's a pretty telling song and then me and Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry finished it, production-wise, threw some strings on it and made it a little bit darker and a little bit more rocky.\" Danja and Marcella Araica contributed to additional lyrics, with Danja, Kanal and Harry serving as the producers of the song. Araica, Harry and Jake Davis recorded the track at Sha Recording (Malibu, California), 3:20 Studios (Los Feliz, Los Angeles) and Henson Recording Studios (Virginia Beach, Virginia). Stevie Blacke arranged and performed all the strings, Jimmy Harry was also responsible for guitars and keyboards, while Tony Kanal provided bass.\n\"Sober\" was selected to be \"Funhouse\"'s second single, after the huge success of \"So What\". It received airplay before release in Australia on Today Network's stations and the Hot 30 Countdown and was the number one most added song on Australian radio. It was first released as a digital download on iTunes, on October 31, 2008, before being released to radio stations on December 1, 2008. While announced its release on her official website, Pink claimed, \"It\u2019s just a really, really personal beautiful song, one of my favorites.\u201d While reviewing the single, Alex Fletcher wrote for Digital Spy that the song is \"a dramatic U-turn from the brash and ballsy single 'So What', but reiterated that \"it's a better representation of her 'Funhouse' album\" than its lead single.\" Slant's Jonathan Keefe disagreed, calling it an \"oddly-chosen second single.\"\n\"Sober\" is a power pop song, featuring heavy guitars and booming snare. It is written in the key of E minor (recorded in D\u266f minor) and set at a moderately slow tempo of 91 beats per minute, following a chord progression of D\u266f5\u2013B5\u2013F\u266f. In the song, Pink's vocals span from the low-note of D\u266f\u2083 to the high-note of B\u2085. Lyrically, the song speaks about the quiet sense of discomfort in being sober. Lucy Davies of BBC Music went further, writing that the song \"discusses the blackouts resulting from drinking to avoid becoming those she sneers at.\" Chris William, writing for Entertainment Weekly, commented that the song finds Pink \"questioning her need to be numbed by booze and noise.\" Mark Blankenship of New Now Next analyzed the song, writing that it is \"about a woman who only loves herself when she\u2019s drunk, who wishes she could like herself this much when she\u2019s sober, but who can\u2019t seem to pull herself out of her spiral. She later discussed the song's lyrics in two interviews, stating:\nI wrote a song called \"Sober\", which is actually really dark. I was at a party at my own house, I didn't want to be there, I didn't want anyone else there. And I had this line in my head saying, 'How do I feel this good sober?', it's not just about alcohol, it's"

Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard, \"Even Flow\" was released in 1992 as the second single from the band's debut album, Ten (1991). The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003). A remixed version of the song was included on the 2009 Ten reissue.\n\"Even Flow\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, \"I knew it was a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it.\" Drummer Dave Krusen said, \"I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation.\" He added that \"it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better.\" Guitarist Mike McCready stated, \"We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare. We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out.\"\nAn alternate version of the song was recorded with drummer Dave Abbruzzese in 1992 while the band was recording songs for the soundtrack for the 1992 film, Singles. This version was used for the music video, and was used in single releases in the United Kingdom. This version can also be found on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003).\n\"Even Flow\" was written in the key of D major, with Gossard performing his parts in open D tuning and McCready complementing it with a similar rhythm pattern in standard tuning. The recorded version of the song actually sounds slightly sharper than D major, with everything tuned up \u2014 accidentally or otherwise \u2014 around one quarter of a step. The song features a funk guitar riff by Gossard.\nMcCready on the song:\nThat's me pretending to be Stevie Ray Vaughan, and a feeble attempt at that. Stone (Gossard, Pearl Jam guitarist) wrote the riff and song; I think it's a D tuning. I just followed him in a regular pattern. I tried to steal everything I know from Stevie Ray Vaughan and put it into that song. A blatant rip-off. A tribute rip-off, if you will!\nThe vocal line that appears in the main verse begins with a very prominent tritone interval.\nThe stark lyrics by Vedder for \"Even Flow\" describe the experience of being a homeless man. The subject sleeps \"on a pillow made of concrete\" and panhandles passersby for spare change. In addition to being illiterate, he may also be mentally ill, as he \"looks insane\" when he smiles and struggles to keep coherent thoughts (\"Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies/Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away\").\nAt Pearl Jam's March 28, 1994, concert at the Bayfront Amphitheater in Miami, Vedder introduced the song by saying, \"I thought I'd throw in a bit of street education while you still have an open mind....Right across the street there's a little homeless community that lives under the bridge. You should just know that those people ain't all crazy and sometimes it's not their fault. This song is called 'Even Flow'.\"\nAt the May 12, 2008, show in Toronto, Vedder stated that the song was written under the Space Needle in Seattle. At a subsequent show in Seattle on August 8, 2018, Vedder revealed that the song was inspired by a homeless Vietnam War veteran (also named Eddie) whom he befriended while working on the band's first album. Vedder wrote the song after learning that the man had died while the band was touring.\nWhile the \"Even Flow\" single was released commercially to international markets in 1992, the commercial single was not released in the United States until June 27, 1995, and was only available as a more expensive import version beforehand. The alternate studio recording of \"Even Flow\", which was recorded in 1992 with Abbruzzese, was released as a CD single and 12-inch white vinyl in the United Kingdom. The original version was used in single releases in the United States. The song was released as a single in 1992 with a previously unreleased funk B-side titled \"Dirty Frank\", which can also be found as an extra track on European releases of"

It was released on June 9, 2014, and was made available for digital download on Amazon and iTunes on June 10. The single reached number one on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, making it the band's seventh number one single on the chart.\nIn an interview with the Pulse of Radio, and regarding how the single came together, lead singer Sully Erna revealed that it was written in about an hour, stating, \"It's one of those songs that surprisingly came out and was written from back to front in, like, an hour. I started putting one thing together with the next, and then Shannon Larkin started jumping in and then we arranged the whole song, and literally within an hour, maybe 90 minutes, this whole song was written and it was one of the last songs that we wrote, and it ended up becoming the first single.\"\nWhen interviewed by Full Metal Jackie, Erna offered additional details as how the single came to be, stating, \"We had been working on stuff that we had on our own and brought in. I go, 'You know what? We haven\u2019t wrote anything yet, I'm just going to write a song real quick before TC gets back from dinner.' Tony, kidding around, said, 'You should make it a real fast riff because he'll be right back.' So I started playing really fast and then all of a sudden, I was like, 'Hold on. I have something going here.' I started hearing the different movements in the chords and it just started to feel like it was coming together. Then all of a sudden, within 90 minutes the whole song kind of wrote itself.\"\nIn the same interview with the Pulse of Radio, Erna revealed that the working title for the single was \"100,000 Horsepower\", but he felt he needed to change it, explaining, \"Actually, the original title I wanted to put on the song was '100,000 Horsepower'. But unfortunately, rhythmically, it was too many syllables and I couldn't make it fit the way I wanted to creatively, so I trimmed it back to '1000 Horsepower', which is still pretty fuckin' powerful, by the way.\"\nDigital single\nOn August 12, the music video for 1000hp premiered on Shazam, a commercial smartphone-based music identification service. One day later, it premiered on Godsmack's official Vevo channel.\nOn August 4, Godsmack took the stage at the iHeartRadio Theater in New York City as part of the iHeartRadio Live Series for an intimate live performance. The show, which was streamed online, saw the band perform 1000hp live for the first time.\n\nARTISTdirect reviewer Rick Florino gave the song a favorable review and described it as a \"bombastic Boston bruiser of epic proportions\" and that \"all of the hallmarks of the band's patented sound remain intact.\" Florino concluded his review by saying, \"It's the kind of tune you could hear at sports events and during high-octane action movie set pieces for years to come. It's exactly how real rock should sound in 2014, and it's one of the best singles of the year.\" A less favorable review came from Shelly Barclay of AXS, who felt that the song was not on a par with the band's other singles, stating, \"The song does not have the same guttural edge as songs like 'Keep Away'.\" However, she went on to say that the song \"holds its own in the band's library of rock tunes.\"\nUpon its release, \"1000hp\" entered both the Billboard Mainstream Rock and Hot Rock Songs charts, peaking at number one and twenty-two, respectively. \"1000hp\" also debuted at number one on the U.S. iTunes Rock Chart.\n\n\n\nGodsmack\nSully Erna \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, producer\nTony Rombola \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals\nRobbie Merrill \u2013 bass guitar\nShannon Larkin \u2013 drums, percussion\nTechnical personnel\nDave Fortman \u2013 production, mixing\n\"Godsmack: '1000hp' Single Premiere\".

It was the lead single from his second studio album Storyline (2014). Hayes co-wrote the song in a collaboration with Bonnie Baker and Katrina Elam, while the production was handled by Hayes and Dann Huff. The song was debuted at the 2014 Grammy Awards on January 26, 2014, and was released to digital retailers the same day.\nHayes wrote this song about the bullying that he experienced while growing up. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Hayes said, \"To me it's also just about being misunderstood. Just me being in high school, just the smallest scale I know compared to a lot of stories that I've heard, a lot of people that I've met ... yes, I was a total geek, I was a total nerd, and you know, I still am, and I'm proud of that. But it took me a while to realize that it's OK to be proud of that, right? Because in that time and period of my life, if you didn't fit in, what else was there? Fortunately for me I had incredible parents, I had an incredible support system, musicians around me, and that showed me that there was hope -- that there was maybe something else I could look forward to.\"\nThe music video was directed by Ray Kay and premiered on March 13, 2014.\nThe song received generally positive reviews. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country called the song a \"complex and satisfying expression\" of vulnerability, and praised Hayes for choosing a song with a personal message for his big Grammy moment. Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal was complimentary of both the \"emotional, powerful and inspirational\" lyrics as well as Hayes' conviction, noting that the song indicates growth and maturity over Hayes' debut.\nBrian Braiker of The Guardian was less favorable, saying that \"the song is anodyne, safe and bland. It\u2019ll do fine.\" Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly was also unfavorable, giving the song a \"C+\" and saying that \"His anti-bullying ballad is overbearing, preachy, and perhaps worst of all, boring. If you're gonna write popular music's 457th song about self-esteem, at least don't make it pander to every last clich\u00e9.\"\nHayes performed the song live at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. Entertainment Weekly also graded this performance \"C+\", with Nick Catucci writing that Hayes \"provided the first down moment of the night with a saccharine new song\" and that his performance was \"most notable for the inspirational quotes from the likes of John Lennon and, uh, Steve Jobs, Lady Gaga, and Johnny Depp projected behind him\".\nDigital download\n\"Invisible\" \u2013 4:32\nCD single\n\"Invisible\" \u2013 4:32\n\"Invisible (Instrumental)\" - 4:32\n\"Invisible\" sold 35,000 downloads in the few hours after its premiered on the Grammy, and on the strength on the few hours of sales, the song debuted on the Hot Country Songs at No. 23, and Country Digital Songs charts at No. 7.  This represents Hunter Hayes' highest ever debut thus far. It also debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 88.  In the following week it reached No. 1 on the Country Digital Songs chart with 92,000 copies sold for the week, and reaching No. 4 on Hot Country Songs and No. 44 on Billboard Hot 100.\nThe song has sold 419,000 copies in the U.S. as of June 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hunter Hayes Announces \"We're Not Invisible Tour\" Which Kicks Off March 20\".

It was released on June 9, 2014, and was made available for digital download on Amazon and iTunes on June 10. The single reached number one on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, making it the band's seventh number one single on the chart.\nIn an interview with the Pulse of Radio, and regarding how the single came together, lead singer Sully Erna revealed that it was written in about an hour, stating, \"It's one of those songs that surprisingly came out and was written from back to front in, like, an hour. I started putting one thing together with the next, and then Shannon Larkin started jumping in and then we arranged the whole song, and literally within an hour, maybe 90 minutes, this whole song was written and it was one of the last songs that we wrote, and it ended up becoming the first single.\"\nWhen interviewed by Full Metal Jackie, Erna offered additional details as how the single came to be, stating, \"We had been working on stuff that we had on our own and brought in. I go, 'You know what? We haven\u2019t wrote anything yet, I'm just going to write a song real quick before TC gets back from dinner.' Tony, kidding around, said, 'You should make it a real fast riff because he'll be right back.' So I started playing really fast and then all of a sudden, I was like, 'Hold on. I have something going here.' I started hearing the different movements in the chords and it just started to feel like it was coming together. Then all of a sudden, within 90 minutes the whole song kind of wrote itself.\"\nIn the same interview with the Pulse of Radio, Erna revealed that the working title for the single was \"100,000 Horsepower\", but he felt he needed to change it, explaining, \"Actually, the original title I wanted to put on the song was '100,000 Horsepower'. But unfortunately, rhythmically, it was too many syllables and I couldn't make it fit the way I wanted to creatively, so I trimmed it back to '1000 Horsepower', which is still pretty fuckin' powerful, by the way.\"\nDigital single\nOn August 12, the music video for 1000hp premiered on Shazam, a commercial smartphone-based music identification service. One day later, it premiered on Godsmack's official Vevo channel.\nOn August 4, Godsmack took the stage at the iHeartRadio Theater in New York City as part of the iHeartRadio Live Series for an intimate live performance. The show, which was streamed online, saw the band perform 1000hp live for the first time.\n\nARTISTdirect reviewer Rick Florino gave the song a favorable review and described it as a \"bombastic Boston bruiser of epic proportions\" and that \"all of the hallmarks of the band's patented sound remain intact.\" Florino concluded his review by saying, \"It's the kind of tune you could hear at sports events and during high-octane action movie set pieces for years to come. It's exactly how real rock should sound in 2014, and it's one of the best singles of the year.\" A less favorable review came from Shelly Barclay of AXS, who felt that the song was not on a par with the band's other singles, stating, \"The song does not have the same guttural edge as songs like 'Keep Away'.\" However, she went on to say that the song \"holds its own in the band's library of rock tunes.\"\nUpon its release, \"1000hp\" entered both the Billboard Mainstream Rock and Hot Rock Songs charts, peaking at number one and twenty-two, respectively. \"1000hp\" also debuted at number one on the U.S. iTunes Rock Chart.\n\n\n\nGodsmack\nSully Erna \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, producer\nTony Rombola \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals\nRobbie Merrill \u2013 bass guitar\nShannon Larkin \u2013 drums, percussion\nTechnical personnel\nDave Fortman \u2013 production, mixing\n\"Godsmack: '1000hp' Single Premiere\".

It was written by Carole King, Mark Hudson and Greg Wells, and produced by Sir George Martin. \"The Reason\" was released as the second single from the album in selected European countries on 8 December 1997. In France, it was issued as a double A-side single with \"My Heart Will Go On\".\nCarole King wrote this song first for the band Aerosmith.\nThe music video was directed by Scott Lochmus and released in December 1997. It was showing the recording of the song in the studio.\nDion performed \"The Reason\" during her Let's Talk About Love Tour, and as a duet with Carole King on VH1 Divas and at the 48\u00b0 Festival di Sanremo on 1998 in Italy. On that occasion she also performed \"My Heart Will Go On\".\nThe track was included later on The Collector's Series, Volume One in 2000 and My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection European edition in 2008.\nThe recording of this song was included as a bonus on the Au c\u0153ur du stade DVD.\nFrom 2011\u20132014, \"The Reason\" was included in the set list of Dion's Las Vegas show, Celine. The song was also performed in Dion's 2017 tour and 2018 tour. \"The Reason\" was performed by Dion during her BST Hyde Park concert in London on 5 July 2019. The song was also performed during the first two US shows of Dion's Courage World Tour in 2019.\nCarole King recorded also her own version of this song for her 2001 album Love Makes the World, this time with Dion on backing vocals.\nPip Ellwood-Hughes from Entertainment Focus noted that the song \"immediately reminds you of why Dion has become such a powerhouse.\" He added that \"it highlights how she can pack power and emotion into everything she sings.\" The New York Observer editor Jonathan Bernstein reviewed, \"It kicks off in time-honored fashion with a bombastic power ballad, \"The Reason,\" co-written by Carole King and produced by Sir George Martin. Thus, straight away, we find the inherent wrongheadedness of this record. Carole King hasn't written a memorable song in many a year and-hello?-didn't George Martin recently announce that he was quitting the producing racket because his hearing was going? The latter affliction was probably incurred by a silent prayer offered up during the recording of \"The Reason\" to be struck deaf\". \u00d8yvin S\u00f8raa from Oppland Arbeiderblad called it the best song of the Let's Talk About Love album, describing it as \"powerpop\" with \"clear rock backing\". Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In said that it celebrate's love \"and the affection of a good man\".

The song was written by Aldo Nova and Stephan Moccio and produced by Walter Afanasieff and Nova. It was released as the album's lead single on 11 March 2002. \"A New Day Has Come\" is a piano-driven ballad in  time. However, the midtempo radio version, co-produced by Christian B & Marc Dold of (S.A.F.) along with Ric Wake, converted the song into  time and was released as the lead single. Both versions are included on the album.\nDion revealed that the song represents the birth of her child. It received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Dion's vocals and its uplifting lyrics. The music video was directed by Dave Meyers and premiered in March 2002. The song was a success around the world, reaching top ten on the Canadian Singles Chart, UK Singles Chart and many European charts; while reaching number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping for 21 weeks the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. The song was later included on compilations My Love: Essential Collection, Complete Best, Ultimate Box in 2008 as well as The Best So Far... 2018 Tour Edition in 2018.\nIn 2000, Dion announced that she was taking a break from her career. During the time away, she focused on her personal life and gave birth to her first child. After two years, Dion announced her return and admitted she was eager to get back into the studio. \"I couldn't wait to go back into the recording studio. And, I loved the songs that people wrote for me on this album. Those songs became even closer to me because, the fact that I took two years off, they wrote songs for me that were even closer to my emotions. I had things to talk about. I had things to sing about. It was a fun adventure, no pressure, relaxed, smooth, powerful but controlled. I really had a wonderful time. And to see my friends again, it was great.\"\nThe single is her first in English since 2000's \"I Want You to Need Me\". \"A New Day Has Come\" was released on 6 February 2002 to radio stations in the US. It was released on 11 March 2002 internationally. In October 2008, \"A New Day Has Come\" was included on the compilation My Love: Essential Collection.\n\"A New Day Has Come\" was written by Aldo Nova and Stephan Moccio and produced by Walter Afanasieff, Nova  and Ric Wake (the latter only produced the \"radio edit\"). The song also features additional production from Richie Jones, Christian B, and Marc Dold. The song has two versions: the piano-driven ballad in  time and the midtempo radio version in common time. Both versions are available on the album.  Both versions of the song are written in the key of F\u266f major.  The original version of the song features a slow tempo of 40 beats per minute, while the radio remix features one of 92 beats per minute.\nLyrically, the song is about the world thinking that she has it all, but she draws us in to the sadness she must have experienced with life issues, such as her older husband being ill and knowing that she had problems conceiving a baby. Her then 13-month-old son Rene-Charles Dion Angelil is the main subject of the love song, with Dion singing: \"Where there was weakness I've found my strength/All in the eyes of a boy.\"\nAccording to herself, the song is about her son: \"For me, this represents the birth of my child. Nothing can ever come close to that. But it can mean different things for anyone who has to find strength again. I think it's very positive.\"\n\"A New Day Has Come\" garnered mostly stellar reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic highlighted the song. Barnes & Noble's Editorial review wrote that \"It marks Celine Dion's return to recording after a lengthy maternity leave, and charts the pop diva's growth as an artist and as a woman. Although Dion's songs have always been about the power of love she wasn't mincing words when she titled her 1997 blockbuster Let's Talk About Love, maternal rather than romantic sentiment fuels her fire this time out. As she gushes on the uplifting title song.\" Chuck Taylor from Billboard wrote that the life-affirming \"A New Day Has Come\" \"comes off like a gentle exhale against the world's ills.\" The Ric Wake"

A Decade of Song, released on 1 November 1999. It peaked within the top ten in many countries, like Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. Billboard listed it as one of the Greatest Songs of 1999.\nIt was written and produced by Swedish producers Andreas Carlsson, Max Martin and Kristian Lundin, who had written a string of hit songs for artists such as NSYNC, Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears.\n\"That's the Way It Is\" starts out in the key of E major with a moderate tempo of 93 beats per minute.  Throughout the verses, the song follows a chord progression of C\u266fm\u2013A\u2013B, and Dion's vocals span from B\u2083 to E\u2085.\nThe song has a bridge, and after the bridge is the chorus repeated, only in the key of A major.\nDion sang it live with NSYNC, during her 1999 CBS Special. She also performed \"That's the Way It Is\" on Top of the Pops on 12 November, the 1999 Billboard Music Awards, the Bambi Awards on 11 December, The Rosie O'Donnell Show on 13 December, The Today Show on 31 December, and on the Let's Talk About Love Tour as the closing song.\nWhen Dion returned to the music scene after her 2 years off in 2002, the song was performed on her promotional tour for the A New Day Has Come album including a second time at The Today Show, The Early Show, and at the concert for World Children's Day.\nIn 2015 for the first time in 13 years, Dion added the song as an acoustic version and later the full length version in her 2nd Las Vegas residency show Celine at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. The song was also performed in Dion's 2017 European tour and her 2018 tour. \"That's the Way it is\" was performed by Dion during her BST Hyde Park concert in London on 5 July 2019. The song is also featured on the Courage World Tour in North America.\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that the danceable \"That's the Way It Is\" works and highlighted it as a standout on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Another editor, Jose F. Promis reviewed the US/South Korea CD maxi single and rated it 3 out 5 stars. He called the song itself a \"cheerful pop nugget\", the album version a \"definitive hit\", and the \"Metro Club Remix\" a \"bubbly dance\" version of the song. Michael Paoletta from Billboard highlighted it on the album, and called it a \"welcome uptempo number\". Another editor, Chuck Taylor also praised \"That's the Way It Is\". He wrote that Dion at last \"ups the tempo with the irresistible\" first single. According to Taylor, this new track, a joyful ode to holding the faith but allowing love to take its course when it's ready, matches Dion with a new team of collaborators, consistent hitmakers: Max Martin, Kristian Lundin and Andreas Carlsson. \"Replete with a festive mandolin and a midtempo beat to bring new heights to her as-ever splendid vocal,\" this song is \"destined to enrapture\" top forty and AC the first time through, at last stripping away mainstream radio's gripe that Dion is \"too adult\". He said that, youthful and yet elegant, and glowing brightly with warmth, the song also represents a bold step forward for Martin, who is best known for his work with chart-topping youth acts. All in all, \"That's the Way It Is\" is \"one of the most compelling radio releases yet\" from \"one of the core voices of the decade.\" Can't Stop the Pop stated that the song \"doesn't sound like it's trying to be Britney Spears; it sounds like the authentic evolution of a superstar \u2013 this is a Celine Dion song through and through \u2013 and it's hard to imagine it being performed by anyone else\".\nThe song became a hit, going to number 1 on the adult contemporary charts in Canada and the United States, reaching the top ten in other countries all over the world. It was Dion's first airplay-only single that charted on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 6 (number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay).

It was written by Carole King, Mark Hudson and Greg Wells, and produced by Sir George Martin. \"The Reason\" was released as the second single from the album in selected European countries on 8 December 1997. In France, it was issued as a double A-side single with \"My Heart Will Go On\".\nCarole King wrote this song first for the band Aerosmith.\nThe music video was directed by Scott Lochmus and released in December 1997. It was showing the recording of the song in the studio.\nDion performed \"The Reason\" during her Let's Talk About Love Tour, and as a duet with Carole King on VH1 Divas and at the 48\u00b0 Festival di Sanremo on 1998 in Italy. On that occasion she also performed \"My Heart Will Go On\".\nThe track was included later on The Collector's Series, Volume One in 2000 and My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection European edition in 2008.\nThe recording of this song was included as a bonus on the Au c\u0153ur du stade DVD.\nFrom 2011\u20132014, \"The Reason\" was included in the set list of Dion's Las Vegas show, Celine. The song was also performed in Dion's 2017 tour and 2018 tour. \"The Reason\" was performed by Dion during her BST Hyde Park concert in London on 5 July 2019. The song was also performed during the first two US shows of Dion's Courage World Tour in 2019.\nCarole King recorded also her own version of this song for her 2001 album Love Makes the World, this time with Dion on backing vocals.\nPip Ellwood-Hughes from Entertainment Focus noted that the song \"immediately reminds you of why Dion has become such a powerhouse.\" He added that \"it highlights how she can pack power and emotion into everything she sings.\" The New York Observer editor Jonathan Bernstein reviewed, \"It kicks off in time-honored fashion with a bombastic power ballad, \"The Reason,\" co-written by Carole King and produced by Sir George Martin. Thus, straight away, we find the inherent wrongheadedness of this record. Carole King hasn't written a memorable song in many a year and-hello?-didn't George Martin recently announce that he was quitting the producing racket because his hearing was going? The latter affliction was probably incurred by a silent prayer offered up during the recording of \"The Reason\" to be struck deaf\". \u00d8yvin S\u00f8raa from Oppland Arbeiderblad called it the best song of the Let's Talk About Love album, describing it as \"powerpop\" with \"clear rock backing\". Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In said that it celebrate's love \"and the affection of a good man\". Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic noted the song as \"a typical Celine mid-tempo ballad with plenty of high notes for Celine to hit and re-establish her presence.\"\nEuropean CD single\n\"The Reason\" \u2013 5:01\n\"Be the Man\" \u2013 4:39\nFrench CD single (double A-side)\n\"The Reason\"\u00a0\u2013 5:01\n\"My Heart Will Go On\"\u00a0\u2013 4:40\nUK cssette single\n\"The Reason\" \u2013 5:01\n\"Be the Man\" \u2013 4:39\n\"The Christmas Song\" \u2013 4:12\nEuropean/UK CD maxi-single and French 12\" single\n\"The Reason\" \u2013 5:01\n\"Be the Man\" \u2013 4:39\n\"Make You Happy\" \u2013 4:31\n\"With this Tear\" \u2013 4:12\nUK CD maxi-single #2 \n\"The Reason\" \u2013 5:01\n\"Cherche encore\" \u2013 3:24\n\"Lovin' Proof\" \u2013 4:09\n\"The Christmas Song\" \u2013 4:12\nEuropean/UK promo single\n\"The Reason\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 4:30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench Top 100 singles of the 1990s\nList of number-one singles of 1998 (France)\nA Released as a double A-side with \"My Heart Will Go On\".\nGlatzer, Jenna (2005).

It was written by Carey, Bryan-Michael Cox, Adonis Shropshire and Kendrick Dean, and produced by the former two. \"I Stay in Love\" was released through Island Records on October 28, 2008, as the fourth and final single from the album.  Drawing influence from the R&B music genre, the song features a piano and keyboard-driven melody, and a strong accompanying drum-beat. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting \"her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track.\" She describes the old time she shared with her love interest. She narrates that even though they said let go, and that she is aware that there is nothing left in their relationship, she still \"stays in love with him\".\n\"I Stay in Love\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many considering the song a strong ballad and a highlight from the album, while complimenting its production and piano-driven melody, despite criticizing the similarities to Carey's previous single, \"We Belong Together\" (2005). The song performed weak commercially, becoming Carey's first single from the album to not chart on the US Billboard Hot 100, although peaking at number eighty-one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and becoming Carey's fourteenth number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. In the United Kingdom, the song debuted and peaked at number ninety-five, and spent only one week on the UK Singles Chart.\nCarey performed \"I Stay in Love\" live on two high-profile televised events. First, on November 8, 2008, she was featured as a guest judge and musical performer of the fifth season of the popular British talent competition, The X Factor. Additionally, Carey performed it live at the American Music Awards, held on November 23, 2008. The song's accompanying music video was filmed by Carey's husband, Nick Cannon, and features Carey as a dancer in a Las Vegas show at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino Resort. Additionally, during the show and its preparations, Carey realizes that her ex-lover has found love with one of her fellow dancers, leading her to blow up the car he gave her, as well as its accompaniments in the Mojave Desert.\n\"I Stay in Love\" was written and produced by Mariah Carey and Bryan-Michael Cox, with additional songwriting from Adonis Shropshire and Kendrick Dean, for Carey's eleventh studio album, E=MC\u00b2 (2008). Carey produced the track for Maroon Entertainment and by Cox for Blabby Inc. Copyright is held by Rye Songs which is administered by Songs of Universal (BMI)/W.B.M. Music Corp. O/D/O itself and Songs in the key of B Flat/Noontime South/EMI Foray Music O/B/O itself and Phoenix Ave. Publishing/Christian Combs Publishing (SESAC). The song was recorded by Brian Garten at Stone Groove Studios in New York, and mixed by Phil Tan for Riotproof Productions, Inc. All instrumentation was performed by Cox, while Carey sung all the lead and background vocals. In an interview with Ed Lover for the radio station Power 105 in New York City, Carey revealed that the song was one of her favorites from the album and that she recorded her vocals within a day. Following the commercial underperformance of the album's third single, \"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\", \"I Stay in Love\" was released as the fourth single from E=MC\u00b2. In the United States, it was serviced to mainstream, rhythmic and urban radio stations on October 28, 2008. A four-track EP consisting of remixes by Jody den Broeder and Ralphi Rosario was released in the United States on December 16, 2008.\n\"I Stay in Love\" is a \"beat-driven\" and \"piano-laced\" ballad, that is influenced by pop and R&B music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. It is composed in the key of D\u266d major, with Carey's vocals spanning from the low note of D\u266d\u2083 to the high note of G\u266d\u2085. The song moves at a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute in cut time, and it follows a chord progression of D\u266d\u2013B\u266dm7\u2013G\u266d\u2013A\u266d.  The song features a \"double voice\" effect during its final chorus, where Carey's normal singing tone throughout the rest of the song is combined with her raised pitch. She raises the pitch one octave, and layers it over her normal tone. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting \"her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track.\" She describes the old time she shared with her lover. She also admits that even though they did attempt to save their relationship,"

It was released as a single the following month, and became a major hit on both the country and pop music charts, reaching No. 1 in both at the start of 1960 (the first No. 1 hit of the 1960s). It won the Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording in 1961, and remains Robbins' best-known song. It is widely considered a genre classic for its gripping narrative which ends in the death of its protagonist, its shift from past to present tense, haunting harmonies by vocalists Bobby Sykes and Jim Glaser (of the Glaser Brothers) and the eloquent and varied Spanish guitar accompaniment by Grady Martin that lends the recording a distinctive Tex-Mex feel. The name of the character Feleena was based upon a schoolmate of Robbins in the fifth grade, Fidelina Martinez.\nMembers of the Western Writers of America chose \"El Paso\" as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.\nThe song is a first-person narrative told by a cowboy in El Paso, Texas, in the days of the Wild West. The singer recalls how he frequented \"Rosa's Cantina\", where he became smitten with a young Mexican dancer named Feleena. When the singer notices another cowboy sharing a drink with \"wicked Feleena\", out of jealousy he challenges the newcomer to a gunfight. The singer kills the newcomer, then flees. In the act of escaping, the singer commits the additional hanging offense of horse theft. Departing the town, the singer hides out in the \"badlands of New Mexico.\"\nThe song then fast-forwards to an undisclosed time later \u2013 the lyrics at this point change from past to present tense \u2013 when the singer describes the yearning for Feleena that drives him to return, without regard for his own life, to El Paso. He states that his \"love is stronger than [his] fear of death.\" Upon arriving, the singer races for the cantina, but is chased and fatally wounded by a posse. Feleena rushes to his side, and he dies in her arms after \"one little kiss\".\n\n\n\n\nThere have been three versions of Robbins' original recording of \"El Paso\": the original full-length version, the edited version, and the abbreviated version, which is an alternate take in stereo that can be found on the Gunfighter Ballads album. The original version, released on a 45 single record, is in mono and is around 4 minutes and 38 seconds in duration, far longer than most contemporary singles at the time, especially in the country genre. Robbins' longtime record company, Columbia Records, was unsure whether radio stations would play such a long song, so it released two versions of the song on a promo 45: the full-length version on one side, and an edited version on the other which was nearer to the three-minute mark. This version omitted a verse describing the cowboy's remorse over the \"foul evil deed [he] had done\" before his flight from El Paso. The record-buying public, as well as most disc jockeys, overwhelmingly preferred the full-length version.\n\"El Paso\" frequently was performed by the Grateful Dead in concert. The song entered the band's repertoire in 1969, and remained there until the band's demise in 1995; in total, it was performed 389 times. It was sung by rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, with Jerry Garcia contributing harmony vocals. On the album Ladies and Gentlemen... the Grateful Dead, Bob Weir introduces the song as the Dead's \"most requested number\".\nThe alternative country band Old 97's covered the song, changing the time signature from 3/4 to 4/4. Their cover appears on Hit by a Train: The Best of Old 97's as well as the King of the Hill original TV soundtrack.\nGrady Martin released an instrumental version in 1965 on his Instrumentally Yours album.\nEl Paso has also been recorded by Max Stalling, Michael Martin Murphey, Tom Russell, The Mills Brothers, and Jason and the Scorchers.\nAfter Lolita and her Western Trio had a hit in the US with Seemann (Deine Heimat ist das Meer) she recorded a German version of El Paso which contributed to a long series of bi-national songs such as Wenn der Sommer Kommt and two songs which would top the U.S. country charts thirteen years later as performed by Marie Osmond  Lieber Jonny, Komm doch Wieder and Das einsame Haus in Waikiki.\nA parody version, \"El Pizza\" by H.B. Barnum, was a radio hit in 1960. It moved the action to Azusa, California, where Rosa's Cantina became a pizza place where Feleena worked as a waitress.\nHomer and Jethro"

It took two years of shopping the song around Nashville before Bobby Bare recorded it on his album Bare at the urging of Shel Silverstein. Bare's version did not catch on and was never released as a single, so Schlitz recorded it himself, but that version failed to chart higher than No. 65. Other musicians took notice and recorded the song in 1978, including Johnny Cash, who put it on his album Gone Girl.\nIt was Kenny Rogers, however, who made the song a mainstream success. His version was a No. 1 country hit and made its way to the pop charts at a time when country songs rarely crossed over. It was released in November 1978 as the title track from his album The Gambler which won him the Grammy award for best male country vocal performance in 1980. In 2006, Don Schlitz appeared in the Kenny Rogers career retrospective documentary \"The Journey\", in which he praised both Rogers' and producer Larry Butler's contributions to the song, stating \"they added several ideas that were not mine, including the new guitar intro\".\nThe song itself tells the story of a late-night meeting on a train \"bound for nowhere\" between the narrator and a man known only as \"the gambler\". The gambler tells the narrator that he can tell he is down on his luck (\"out of aces\") by the look in his eyes, and offers him advice in exchange for his last swallow of whisky. After the gambler takes the drink (and smokes a cigarette), he gives the following advice:\nYou've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,\nKnow when to walk away, know when to run.\n\nYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table,\n\nThere'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.\nThe gambler then mentions that the \"secret to survivin' is knowing what to throw away, and knowing what to keep\" and that \"the best you can hope for is to die in your sleep\". At this point, the gambler puts out the cigarette and goes to sleep. Shortly thereafter, he indeed dies in his sleep as he had hoped; \"somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even\", and the narrator finds \"an ace that I could keep\", \"in his final words.\"\n\n\n\n\nJohnny Cash on Gone Girl (1978)\nAlvin and the Chipmunks on their album Urban Chipmunk (1981)\nBlake Shelton on Cracker Barrel: Songs of the Year Concert (2007)\nBrian Posehn with Jamey Jasta on Fart and Wiener Jokes (2010)\nSlightly Stoopid on The Gambler (Single) (2020)\nThe song became Rogers's signature song and most enduring hit. It was one of five consecutive songs by Rogers to hit No. 1 on the Billboard country music charts. On the pop chart, the song made it to No. 16, and No. 3 on the Easy Listening chart. \nIt inspired a a series of TV movies loosely inspired by the song and set in the Old West, starting with Kenny Rogers as The Gambler (1980) and followed by Kenny Rogers as The Gambler: The Adventure Continues (1983), Kenny Rogers as The Gambler, Part III: The Legend Continues (1987), The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw (1991), and Gambler V: Playing for Keeps (1994).\nAs of November 13, 2013, the digital sales of the single stood at 798,000 copies and after all these years the single has yet to be certified gold by RIAA certifications. In 2018, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\" The song was ranked number 18 out of the top 76 songs of the 1970s by Internet radio station WDDF Radio in their 2016 countdown.\nFollowing Rogers' death on March 20, 2020, \"The Gambler\" soared to No. 1 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart, followed by \"Islands in the Stream\", with Dolly Parton, which debuted at No. 2.\n\nOn an episode of Monday Night Raw on November 12, 2001, at the FleetCenter in Boston, Massachusetts, wrestler The Rock sang the chorus to the at the time heel character of Stone Cold Steve Austin in a sing off after Austin sang \"Delta Dawn\" off key to jeers, The Rock sang the chorus of \"The Gambler\" to cheers.\nThe song became a dressing room anthem for the England players in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, which led to it becoming a pop UK top 40 hit.\nThe song was played during a 2019 MLB World Series commercial showing Houston Astros players playing poker.\nThe Houston Gamblers of the United States Football League, who played in Rogers' hometown, were named after the"

It was independently released as the lead single from their self-titled debut album on 27 September 2004. The song was written in December 2001, with the music composed by Turner and the lyrics written by his older brother Tim (aka \"DubLT\").\n\"These Kids\" reached number one on the ARIA Singles Chart, and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The track was nominated at the 2005 ARIA Music Awards and 2006 APRA Music Awards.\nDubLT is quoted as saying, \"I wrote These Kids after one of my mates committed suicide, so it means a lot to me that it connected with so many people\" ... \n\"I never wrote that song thinking it would be recorded or that Joel would get famous. But there is a reason I wrote that song and there\u2019s a reason why Joel got famous. It was so I could bring out that song and someone could see the light.\"\n\u2014\u2009Tim Turner\n In more recent times, the track has also been dedicated to Joel Turner's troubled childhood neighbour and friend.\nMuch of the song's popularity is thought to be due to the reality of its subject matter. It aims to draw attention to the plight of street kids: \n\"Nobody knows the suffering they go through \n And you wouldn\u2019t believe 'em if they told you\"\n The song offers a message of hope to young people going through hard times while also criticizing the justice system: \n\"Instead of listening to the kids with the problems, they just tick them off more \n Until the kid\u2019s in prison or he\u2019s dead before he\u2019s 24\"\n Other issues covered in the song include crime, drugs and depression, with further references to the suicide of DubLT's friend and the 2001 murder of a 14-year-old Brisbane boy stabbed to death by a family friend who had promised to help him buy marijuana.\nTurner travelled to Cairns in far north Queensland at the age of 15 to record the track with producer David Lynch for M.E.L. Productions. Once there, he laid down the vocals, beat and guitars while DubLT recorded his rap verse on a $20 microphone back in Brisbane. Turner has said that he originally tried using a real beat for the song, but subsequently chose to replace it with beatboxing.\nWhen Australian Idol judge Mark Holden heard the recording some time later, he decided to release a remixed version as Turner's first single, which featured the addition of strings and an alternative rap from DubLT. Although the song was edited to four minutes for radio, the full version can be found on the CD single and album, featuring a longer intro, additional choruses and extended electric guitar work. The original M.E.L. mix is also present on the CD single.\nThe song debuted at number five on the Australian Singles Chart on 10 October 2004. It topped the chart in its ninth week, and remained on the chart for twenty-one consecutive weeks. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 70,000 units. Its U-turn is thought to have been helped by Turner's appearance at the 2004 Australian Idol Grand Final, as well as the song's use in promoting Network Ten television show Summerland.\nThe single was nominated for Breakthrough Artist at the 2005 ARIA Music Awards and for Most Performed Urban Work at the 2006 APRA Music Awards.\nThe video for the song, shot by director Amiel Courtin-Wilson, was filmed in Melbourne, although Turner and his group had originally wanted to shoot it in their hometown of Brisbane. During an interview with Brisbane's Courier Mail in 2007, Turner recalled shooting the video with a bright light shining in his eyes, which led to his squinting throughout the clip.\nAlongside footage of Turner performing the track in a home studio, the video features scenes of a teenage couple sleeping outside a train station and begging on the street to passers-by. At one point, the couple is seen holding up a sign that reads \"HOMELESS & HUNGRY\u2026PLEASE HELP\". Courtin-Wilson has said that many of the people walking past (none of whom were actors) thought that the young pair were genuinely in need, and numerous donations of money had to be turned away.\nA remixed version of the track appears as a bonus track on Turner's second album Out of the Box, featuring a substitute verse by rapper Pos of De La Soul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Music Online Biography\n\"The beat generation\".

It was one of the songs Warren and Mauboy worked on in Los Angeles for her second studio album Get 'Em Girls (2010). However, the song did not make the final track list on the standard edition of Get 'Em Girls and was later included on the deluxe edition. \"Inescapable\" is a pop song written in the key of E minor. Mauboy told The Daily Telegraph that it \"is just about a relationship all gone wrong but also a celebration.\" Her manager David Champion said \"Inescapable\" was a dedication to Sony Music record-label executive Jay Dee Springbett, who was found dead at his Sydney apartment on 30 June 2011. Champion said, \"Jess and JD worked very closely together on making 'Inescapable' and she is devastated by his passing... His spirit lives on in the recording.\"\nJonathon Moran of The Daily Telegraph praised \"Inescapable\" for being \"catchy, sexy, [and] radio-friendly\", while a writer for 97.3 FM called it \"an absolute smash.\" For the week commencing 1 August 2011, \"Inescapable\" debuted at number 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart and number eight on the ARIA Urban Singles Chart. The song peaked at number four on the ARIA Singles Chart on 15 August 2011, and became Mauboy's fifth top-ten single. On the ARIA Urban Singles Chart, \"Inescapable\" peaked at number one. It was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for selling over 140,000 copies.\n\nThe music video was directed by Mark Alston and filmed in Sydney. A behind-the-scenes video of the shoot was posted on The Daily Telegraph website on 3 July 2011. The completed video premiered on Mauboy's Vevo account on 15 July 2011.\nThe video opens showing Mauboy on a blue backdrop singing with a gold microphone inside a gold cube without walls. The next scene shows her in front of a gold backdrop wearing a leopard-print dress with black boots; she is standing beside a man who is tied up and sings to him with a megaphone. Another scene shows Mauboy wearing a navy blue jumpsuit in a room full of mirrors. Throughout the video, Mauboy is seen with two male dancers performing choreography on a dark grey backdrop. The video ends with a dedication to Jay Dee Springbett saying, \"To Jay, We did it! This is our song. Your forever in my heart. Love Jess.\"\nA writer for 97.3 FM called the video \"vibrant, fun, [and] colourful fantastic\" and wrote that it \"showcases Jess at her best & is exactly what the Australian public love about our girl.\" A biographer of Mauboy's for The Celebrity Bureau commented, \"Her single 'Inescapable' was written by renowned US songwriter Diane Warren and went on to achieve DOUBLE PLATINUM sales and over 1 million views on YouTube/Vevo.\"\nMauboy performed \"Inescapable\" live for the first time at the 2011 ASTRA Awards on 21 July 2011.

The original recording was not included on the band's debut album, Republica \u2013 two other versions of the song, the US mix and the original mix, were included. This version was later featured on a greatest hits collection, Ready to Go: The Best Of.\nThe single originally reached number 43 on the UK Singles Chart in April 1996. Later in the year, the song began to gain popularity outside the United Kingdom, charting in Australia, Canada, and the United States. It was remixed and rereleased in the United Kingdom in February 1997, when it reached a new peak of number 13. This rerelease also saw the song chart for the first time in western Europe, reaching number 19 in the Netherlands and number 26 in Ireland.\nGerman DJ Tomcraft released a cover of the song in 2007, and another version was released on 7 June 2010. It continues to be successful in the UK, where it is still frequently featured in advertisements and on TV.\n\"Ready to Go\" (unreleased)\n\nAlso known as \"Ready to Go [1996]\", \"Ready to Go (original)\" or incorrectly as \"Ready to Go (album version)\", it was not included in any of the band's albums. It is an unreleased song or probably an early demo with slightly different vocal (but lyrics remain the same). This version is softer than both the US and original mixes of the song. It does not have the piano bridge of the original mix, nor the guitar bridge of the US mix. The bridge is similar to that of the original mix, except it lacks a piano.\n\"Ready to Go\" (original mix)\n\nThis version has a more techno-pop sound while the later version contains electric guitars. It charted at number 43 in the United Kingdom and number 40 in Australia.\n\"Ready to Go\"\n\nA mix was included in the Republica album as the opening track. It was remixed by Ben Grosse and released as a single in 1997. This version is the most well-known. It sounds faster and its beat is stronger, making it heavier in terms of tones. On the UK and American issues of the Republica album, this mix of the song was credited just as \"Ready to Go\", and on the European issue of the album it is sometimes marked as \"Ready to Go (US mix)\". A defining difference between this mix and earlier recordings is the inclusion of a guitar bridge in the place of a piano bridge.\n\"Ready to Go\" (Tomcraft version)\n\nGerman DJ Tomcraft released a Eurodance version of the track in 2007.\n\"Ready to Go 2010\"\n\nA new version of the track was released in June 2010. A preview of the track was made available on the band's official Myspace page. The new version has a more aggressive sound than its two predecessors.\nScottish newspaper Aberdeen Evening Express stated that \"this classic bit of punk-fuelled dance could well do the business.\" BuzzFeed ranked it number 37 in their list of The 101 Greatest Dance Songs Of the '90s in 2017. The Daily Vault's Alfredo Narvaez stated that \"Ready To Go\" is \"one of the best examples of pop mixing with techno. The song throws in acoustic guitars, electric guitars and every other noise you can think of and it sounds great.\" Tracey Pepper from Entertainment Weekly noted that it \"erupts with a blast of fuzzed-out power chords, driving dance rhythms, and a rallying sing-along chorus.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote that \"techno meets rock guitar with strident vocals from singer Saffron, all adding up to a fresh, gritty pop sound which Europe simply can't afford to miss.\" A reviewer from Music Week rated the song four out of five, adding that \"this techno pop rock outfit, bursting with potential, lay down a mean, radio friendly single.\" Dave Fawbert from ShortList called it a \"bloody good tune\". Ben Knowles from Smash Hits said in his review of Republica, that the song is a \"good taster from their cocktail of shouty pop, mad bouncy dance and fun guitars.\"\nTwo different music videos were released for the song. In the original video, lead singer Saffron is jumping on the roof of a building. The video was released in 1996, and the shots took place somewhere in East London. This video is very sunny and upbeat. It is said that it shows the hidden beauty of East London. The video also features lead singer Saffron playing the Sega Saturn video games Virtua Fighter 2 and Hang-On GP. The second music video\u2014the Ben Grosse version\u2014is very different from the original one, and was released in early 1997. Saffron is shown jumping in an empty warehouse, then she is"

Mauboy told The Daily Telegraph that it \"is just about a relationship all gone wrong but also a celebration.\" Her manager David Champion said \"Inescapable\" was a dedication to Sony Music record-label executive Jay Dee Springbett, who was found dead at his Sydney apartment on 30 June 2011. Champion said, \"Jess and JD worked very closely together on making 'Inescapable' and she is devastated by his passing... His spirit lives on in the recording.\"\nJonathon Moran of The Daily Telegraph praised \"Inescapable\" for being \"catchy, sexy, [and] radio-friendly\", while a writer for 97.3 FM called it \"an absolute smash.\" For the week commencing 1 August 2011, \"Inescapable\" debuted at number 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart and number eight on the ARIA Urban Singles Chart. The song peaked at number four on the ARIA Singles Chart on 15 August 2011, and became Mauboy's fifth top-ten single. On the ARIA Urban Singles Chart, \"Inescapable\" peaked at number one. It was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for selling over 140,000 copies.\n\nThe music video was directed by Mark Alston and filmed in Sydney. A behind-the-scenes video of the shoot was posted on The Daily Telegraph website on 3 July 2011. The completed video premiered on Mauboy's Vevo account on 15 July 2011.\nThe video opens showing Mauboy on a blue backdrop singing with a gold microphone inside a gold cube without walls. The next scene shows her in front of a gold backdrop wearing a leopard-print dress with black boots; she is standing beside a man who is tied up and sings to him with a megaphone. Another scene shows Mauboy wearing a navy blue jumpsuit in a room full of mirrors. Throughout the video, Mauboy is seen with two male dancers performing choreography on a dark grey backdrop. The video ends with a dedication to Jay Dee Springbett saying, \"To Jay, We did it! This is our song. Your forever in my heart. Love Jess.\"\nA writer for 97.3 FM called the video \"vibrant, fun, [and] colourful fantastic\" and wrote that it \"showcases Jess at her best & is exactly what the Australian public love about our girl.\" A biographer of Mauboy's for The Celebrity Bureau commented, \"Her single 'Inescapable' was written by renowned US songwriter Diane Warren and went on to achieve DOUBLE PLATINUM sales and over 1 million views on YouTube/Vevo.\"\nMauboy performed \"Inescapable\" live for the first time at the 2011 ASTRA Awards on 21 July 2011. On 2 August 2011, she performed the song on the Australia's Got Talent grand finale, wearing a leopard-print jacket, black dress and black heels. She also performed \"Inescapable\" on Sunrise on 9 August 2011, wearing a black and white dress with black heels. A live version of \"Inescapable\" was included on Mauboy's extended play iTunes Session (2014).\nDigital download\n\"Inescapable\" (Youngboyz Mix) \u2013 3:35\n\"Inescapable\" (OFM Mix) \u2013 3:33\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Video: Jessica Mauboy \u2013 Inescapable\".

Written by George Harrison, it was the first of four songs the band provided for the 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine, to meet their contractual obligations to United Artists. The song was recorded mainly in February 1967, during the sessions for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, but the Beatles chose not to include it on that album. The group completed the recording two months later, straight after finishing work on Sgt. Pepper.\nHarrison wrote \"Only a Northern Song\" out of dissatisfaction with his status as a junior songwriter with the Beatles' publishing company, Northern Songs. The lyrics and music convey his disenchantment at how the company retained the copyright for the songs it published, and at how, following its public listing in 1965, the major shareholders profited more from his compositions than he did. The recording features a Hammond organ, played by Harrison, and an overdubbed montage of assorted sounds including trumpet blasts and spoken voices, anticipating John Lennon's 1968 sound collage \"Revolution 9\". Due to the difficulty in assembling the completed track from two tape sources, \"Only a Northern Song\" remained a rare song from the Beatles' post-1963 catalogue that was unavailable in true stereo until 1999. That year, it was remixed for inclusion on the album Yellow Submarine Songtrack.\nThe song has received a varied response from reviewers; while Ian MacDonald dismisses the track as a \"self-indulgent dirge\", the website Ultimate Classic Rock identifies it as one of the Beatles' best works in the psychedelic genre. A version of the song with a different vocal part, and omitting the sound collage overdubs, was issued on the Beatles' 1996 outtakes compilation Anthology 2. Gravenhurst and Yonder Mountain String Band are among the artists who have covered \"Only a Northern Song\".\nGeorge Harrison said that the subject matter for \"Only a Northern Song\" related to both his city of birth, Liverpool, in Merseyside, and the fact that the copyright for the composition belonged to the Beatles' publishing company, Northern Songs. Author Brian Southall describes the song as Harrison's \"personal denunciation of the Beatles' music publishing business\", given his disadvantageous position with Northern Songs. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 1965, as a means of saving John Lennon and Paul McCartney, the Beatles' principal songwriters, the tax liability generated through the international success of their catalogue. Harrison had formed his own publishing company, Harrisongs, in late 1964; despite the financial advantages offered by his 80 per cent stake in that company, he agreed to remain with Northern Songs, to aid the flotation scheme. Among the four Beatles, Lennon and McCartney were major shareholders in Northern Songs, each owning 15 per cent of the public company's shares, and the pair earned considerable wealth over the first year of the flotation. Harrison and Ringo Starr, as contracted songwriters, owned 0.8 per cent each. This arrangement ensured that, in addition to the company retaining the copyright of all its published songs, Lennon and McCartney profited more from Harrison's compositions than he did.\nWhen discussing the song in two late 1990s interviews with Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White, Harrison commented that the main target of his complaints was Dick James, the managing director of Northern Songs. Having been signed by James in 1963, at the age of twenty, Harrison said that the publisher had failed to explain that by signing the contract, he was also signing away the ownership of his compositions. Harrison added that he only understood the consequences after the 1965 flotation, when the major shareholders were \"making all this money out of this catalog\". With reference to the Rutles' 1978 parody of the Beatles' history, All You Need Is Cash, he also told White: \"I think [the message behind 'Only a Northern Song'] was put better in the make-believe TV documentary \u2026 where it said, 'Dick Jaws, an out-of-work music publisher of no fixed ability' signed them up for the rest of their lives.\"\nIn author Ian MacDonald's estimation, \"Only a Northern Song\" suggests that Harrison \"had yet to recover his enthusiasm for being a Beatle\" after he had threatened to leave the group following their final concert tour, in August 1966. Before the band regrouped in November that year to begin recording their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Harrison spent six"

Written by George Harrison, it was the last new track recorded by the band before their break-up in April 1970. The song originated from their January 1969 rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios when they were considering making a return to live performance. Written at a time of acrimony within the group, the lyrics lament humankind's propensity for self-centredness and serve as a comment on the discord that led to Harrison temporarily leaving the Beatles. The musical arrangement alternates between waltz-time verses and choruses played in the hard rock style.\nThe song reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and their denouncement of ego in favour of universal consciousness. When Harrison presented \"I Me Mine\" at Twickenham, John Lennon showed little interest and instead waltzed with Yoko Ono while the other Beatles rehearsed the song. Footage of the couple dancing was included in the Let It Be documentary film. In January 1970, by which point Lennon had privately left the group, the three remaining members formally recorded the song at EMI Studios in London for the Let It Be album. When preparing the album for release, producer Phil Spector extended the track by repeating the chorus and second verse, in addition to adding orchestration and a female choir.\nAmong music critics, several writers have identified \"I Me Mine\" as a powerful final performance by the Beatles and an apt statement from Harrison. The song has been referenced by some religious scholars in their commentary on egoism. Harrison titled his 1980 autobiography I, Me, Mine after the track. The original recording, lasting just 1:34, appeared on the Beatles' 1996 outtakes compilation Anthology 3, introduced by a mock announcement from Harrison referring to Lennon's departure.\nGeorge Harrison wrote \"I Me Mine\" on 7 January 1969, during the second week of the Beatles' filmed rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios in west London. The film project \u2013 which became known as Get Back and eventually Let It Be \u2013 formed part of the Beatles' proposed return to live performance for the first time since 1966. Harrison recalled that after spending two months in the United States in late 1968, he was \"quite optimistic\" about the new project, but the situation within the group \"was just the same as it had been when we were last in the studio ... There was a lot of trivia and games being played.\" For Harrison, the power struggle between John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and the constant presence of Lennon's girlfriend, avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, created an atmosphere that contrasted sharply with the creative freedom and camaraderie he had recently enjoyed with Bob Dylan and the Band in upstate New York.\nWhen writing the song, Harrison drew inspiration from the divisive atmosphere in the band. The 7 January rehearsal was marked by acrimony, as the Beatles argued over the direction of the project. Hours were given over to rehearsing McCartney's \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" with little improvement, and McCartney confronted Lennon over his lack of new songs, drawing a sarcastic response from Lennon. Since the start of the project, Harrison had presented several new songs for consideration, only to see them given laborious treatment by the band or overlooked entirely. That day, he confronted his bandmates about their attitude to his songs; he later complained that due to their greater experience as songwriters, Lennon and McCartney viewed their own material as the priority and \"I'd have to wait through ten of their songs before they'd even listen to one of mine.\" In their study of the tapes from the Get Back project, authors Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that Lennon and McCartney regularly overlooked Harrison's compositions, even when his songs were \"far better than their own\".\nWhen discussing \"I Me Mine\", Harrison said he was addressing the \"eternal problem\" of egoism and that his perspective was informed by his past experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD. He said the concept was in keeping with Swami Vivekananda's teaching that an individual's goal in life was to realise their divine qualities by transcending ego concerns, which Harrison called \"the little 'i'\", and seeing themselves as part of \"the big 'I'; i.e. OM, the complete whole, universal consciousness that is devoid of duality and ego\". Author Jonathan Gould describes the song as a \"commentary on the selfishness\" of Lennon and McCartney, while musicologist Walter Everett says that after Harrison had written"

It first appeared in its original version on Moloko's second album, I Am Not a Doctor; it was released as a single on 8 March 1999, reaching number 45 on the UK Singles Chart. The song experienced chart success after it was remixed by DJ Boris Dlugosch, peaking at number four in the UK in September 1999. Murphy had started writing the lyrics while clubbing in New York City, and knew the song was at heart a dance track, but the group wanted to record it in a different artistic fashion for its album version.\nTogether with their record company they had commissioned mixes by Todd Terry (who had turned Everything But the Girl's \"Missing\" into an international club anthem). Moloko were not satisfied with the Terry mix and had to convince their label Echo Records to put out the Boris D. version instead. The remixed version was eventually featured on over 100 compilations, and was later added on Moloko's third album, Things to Make and Do, after hitting the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. In 1999 it reached number one on the US dance chart. As a form of barter for the remix, Moloko vocalist R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy later co-wrote and appeared on Boris D.'s \"Never Enough\" single, starring in the video for that release as well.\nScottish newspaper Aberdeen Press and Journal viewed \"Sing It Back\" as a \"Balearic hit\". In her review of the I Am Not a Doctor album, Heather Phares from AllMusic described it as a \"techno torch song\". A reviewer from Daily Record said it is \"their best single since 1996's Fun For Me\". Stevie Chick from NME wrote, \"Roisin Murphy, it must be said, has a remarkable voice, a chalky, skewed howl which can twist into a purr, a cry or a sexy growl. On 'Sing It Back', she's cast as Eartha Kitt, all unquenchable lust, sly, coquettish snarls, a luxuriant, lingering sigh. What a shame it's wasted on some of the limpest, radio-friendly handbag tedium ever put on wax.\"\nThe music video was produced to promote the single, directed by Dawn Shadforth. It features Moloko vocalist R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy dancing alone in a metallic flapper dress, accompanied by psychedelic lighting effects. The video is featured on the DVD of Moloko's special edition for the Statues album. It was later published on Moloko's official YouTube channel in October 2016. The video has amassed more than 16,4 million views as of September 2021. \nSeveral live videos exist as well, including one in the group's live concert movie 11,000 Clicks, a similar concert version from the Dutch Pinkpop broadcast, a televised version from the TV show Later... with Jools Holland, and a samba version featured on MTV Brasil.\nQ Magazine ranked \"Sing It Back\" at number 905 in their list of the 1001 Best Songs Ever in 2002.\nAustralian music channel Max placed it at number 887 in their list of 1000 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2012.\nGerman magazine Musikexpress listed the song as number 449 in their ranking of the 700 Best Songs of All-Time in 2014.\nMixmag put the song in their list of Vocal House: The 30 All-Time Biggest Anthems in 2018.\nTomorrowland featured the song in their Official The Ibiza 500 as high as number 55.\nUK CD1\n\"Sing It Back\" (Tee's Radio) \u2013 3:25\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T Loco Mix) \u2013 5:22\n\"Sing It Back\" (DJ Plankton's Dub) \u2013 8:32\nUK CD2\n\"Sing It Back (Boris Musical Mix Edit) \u2013 4:38\n\"Sing It Back (Herbert's Tasteful Dub) \u2013 5:38\n\"Sing It Back (Tee's Freeze Mix) \u2013 9:02\nBoris Dlugosch mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Musical Mix) \u2013 9:15\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Musical Mix Edit) \u2013 4:37\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Main Instrumental) \u2013 9:19\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Funk Dub) \u2013 6:53\n\"Sing It Back\" (Boris Reprise) \u2013 8:14\n\"Sing It Back\" (BMR Club Mix) \u2013 7:12\nLevent Canseven mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Levent's Funk-O-Rama Mix) \u2013 7:40\n\"Sing It Back\" (Levent's Funk-O-Rama Dub) \u2013 7:42\n\"Sing It Back\" (Can 7 Supermarket Mix) \u2013 8:20\n\"Sing It Back\" (Can 7 Supermarket Radio) \u2013 4:04\nMousse T. mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Bootleg Dub) \u2013 7:37\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Feel Love Mix) \u2013 7:09\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mousse T.'s Feelluvdub) \u2013 7:09\nMatthew Herbert mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Herbert's Evangelista Albertini Acid House Mix) \u2013 6:44\n\"Sing It Back\" (Herbert's Tasteful Dub) \u2013 5:58\nTodd Terry mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Mike Penfold paranoia ice Mix) \u2013 9:02\n\"Sing It Back\" (Tee's Radio) \u2013 3:26\nBooker T mixes\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T Loco Mix) \u2013 5:23\n\"Sing It Back\" (Booker T"

With reference to the Rutles' 1978 parody of the Beatles' history, All You Need Is Cash, he also told White: \"I think [the message behind 'Only a Northern Song'] was put better in the make-believe TV documentary \u2026 where it said, 'Dick Jaws, an out-of-work music publisher of no fixed ability' signed them up for the rest of their lives.\"\nIn author Ian MacDonald's estimation, \"Only a Northern Song\" suggests that Harrison \"had yet to recover his enthusiasm for being a Beatle\" after he had threatened to leave the group following their final concert tour, in August 1966. Before the band regrouped in November that year to begin recording their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Harrison spent six"

Written and composed by the group members in collaboration with Matt Rowe and Richard \"Biff\" Stannard during the group's first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album, Spice, released in November 1996. The song was written, composed, and recorded very quickly but the result was considered lacklustre by their label and was sent to be mixed by Dave Way. The group was not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, this time by Mark \"Spike\" Stent.\n\"Wannabe\" is an uptempo dance-pop song which features Mel B and Geri Halliwell rapping. The lyrics, which address the value of female friendship over the heterosexual bond, became an iconic symbol of female empowerment and the most emblematic song of the group's Girl Power philosophy. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the song won for Best British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards and for British Single of the Year at the 1997 Brit Awards.\n\"Wannabe\" was heavily promoted by the group. Its music video, directed by Johan Camitz, became a big success on the British cable network The Box, which sparked press interest in the group. Subsequently, the song had intensive radio airplay across the United Kingdom, while the group performed it on television programmes and started doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines.\nResponding to the wave of public interest in the group, Virgin released the song as the group's debut single in the United Kingdom in July 1996, well ahead of the planned release date of the Spice album. \"Wannabe\" topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and has received a double Platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The song was released in the United States in January 1997, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was the group's only number-one single in that country. By the end of 1996, \"Wannabe\" had topped the charts in 22 nations, and by March 1997 this number had climbed to 37. \"Wannabe\" became the best-selling single by a girl group in the world, with 1,385,211 and 2,910,000 copies sold in United Kingdom (by 2017) and United States (by 2014), respectively, and over 7 million copies worldwide by the end of 1997. In a 2014 study, it was found to be the most easily recognisable pop song of the last 60 years. An EP titled Wannabe 25 was released in 2021 to mark the single's 25th anniversary.\nIn March 1994, father-and-son team Bob and Chris Herbert, together with financer Chic Murphy, working under the business name of Heart Management, placed an advertisement in The Stage, which asked the question: \"Are you street smart, extrovert, ambitious, and able to sing and dance?\" After receiving hundreds of replies, the management had narrowed their search to a group of five girls: Victoria Adams, Melanie Brown, Melanie Chisholm, Geri Halliwell, and Michelle Stephenson. The group moved to a house in Maidenhead and received the name \"Touch\". Stephenson was eventually fired because she lacked the drive of the other group members. She was replaced by Emma Bunton. In November, the group\u2014now named \"Spice\"\u2014persuaded their managers to set up a showcase in front of industry writers, producers, and A&R men at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush, London. Producer Richard Stannard, at the studio for a meeting with pop star Jason Donovan, attended the showcase after hearing Brown, as she went charging across the corridor. Stannard recalls:\nMore than anything, they just made me laugh. I couldn't believe I'd walked into this situation. You didn't care if they were in time with the dance steps or whether one was overweight or one wasn't as good as the others. It was something more. It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.\nStannard stayed behind after the showcase to talk to the group. He then reported to his songwriter partner, Matt Rowe, that he had found \"the pop group of their dreams\". Chris Herbert booked the group's first professional songwriting session with the producers at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, East London, in January 1995. Rowe recalls feelings similar to Stannard's: \"I love them. Immediately. [...] They were like no one I'd met before, really.\" The session was productive; Stannard and Rowe discussed the songwriting process with the group and talked about what the group wanted to do on the record. In her autobiography, Brown recalls that the duo"

Written by George Harrison, it was the first of four songs the band provided for the 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine, to meet their contractual obligations to United Artists. The song was recorded mainly in February 1967, during the sessions for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, but the Beatles chose not to include it on that album. The group completed the recording two months later, straight after finishing work on Sgt. Pepper.\nHarrison wrote \"Only a Northern Song\" out of dissatisfaction with his status as a junior songwriter with the Beatles' publishing company, Northern Songs. The lyrics and music convey his disenchantment at how the company retained the copyright for the songs it published, and at how, following its public listing in 1965, the major shareholders profited more from his compositions than he did. The recording features a Hammond organ, played by Harrison, and an overdubbed montage of assorted sounds including trumpet blasts and spoken voices, anticipating John Lennon's 1968 sound collage \"Revolution 9\". Due to the difficulty in assembling the completed track from two tape sources, \"Only a Northern Song\" remained a rare song from the Beatles' post-1963 catalogue that was unavailable in true stereo until 1999. That year, it was remixed for inclusion on the album Yellow Submarine Songtrack.\nThe song has received a varied response from reviewers; while Ian MacDonald dismisses the track as a \"self-indulgent dirge\", the website Ultimate Classic Rock identifies it as one of the Beatles' best works in the psychedelic genre. A version of the song with a different vocal part, and omitting the sound collage overdubs, was issued on the Beatles' 1996 outtakes compilation Anthology 2. Gravenhurst and Yonder Mountain String Band are among the artists who have covered \"Only a Northern Song\".\nGeorge Harrison said that the subject matter for \"Only a Northern Song\" related to both his city of birth, Liverpool, in Merseyside, and the fact that the copyright for the composition belonged to the Beatles' publishing company, Northern Songs. Author Brian Southall describes the song as Harrison's \"personal denunciation of the Beatles' music publishing business\", given his disadvantageous position with Northern Songs. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 1965, as a means of saving John Lennon and Paul McCartney, the Beatles' principal songwriters, the tax liability generated through the international success of their catalogue. Harrison had formed his own publishing company, Harrisongs, in late 1964; despite the financial advantages offered by his 80 per cent stake in that company, he agreed to remain with Northern Songs, to aid the flotation scheme. Among the four Beatles, Lennon and McCartney were major shareholders in Northern Songs, each owning 15 per cent of the public company's shares, and the pair earned considerable wealth over the first year of the flotation. Harrison and Ringo Starr, as contracted songwriters, owned 0.8 per cent each. This arrangement ensured that, in addition to the company retaining the copyright of all its published songs, Lennon and McCartney profited more from Harrison's compositions than he did.\nWhen discussing the song in two late 1990s interviews with Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White, Harrison commented that the main target of his complaints was Dick James, the managing director of Northern Songs. Having been signed by James in 1963, at the age of twenty, Harrison said that the publisher had failed to explain that by signing the contract, he was also signing away the ownership of his compositions. Harrison added that he only understood the consequences after the 1965 flotation, when the major shareholders were \"making all this money out of this catalog\". With reference to the Rutles' 1978 parody of the Beatles' history, All You Need Is Cash, he also told White: \"I think [the message behind 'Only a Northern Song'] was put better in the make-believe TV documentary \u2026 where it said, 'Dick Jaws, an out-of-work music publisher of no fixed ability' signed them up for the rest of their lives.\"\nIn author Ian MacDonald's estimation, \"Only a Northern Song\" suggests that Harrison \"had yet to recover his enthusiasm for being a Beatle\" after he had threatened to leave the group following their final concert tour, in August 1966.

It was released on June 4, 2012, as the lead single from their debut self-titled studio album. The music video was released on March 11, 2012. \"Ho Hey\" reached number one for 18 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Rock Songs chart, as well as two weeks in the top spot on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and eight weeks in the top spot on the Adult Pop Songs chart, and reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming their first single to do so, as well as their first top 5 single. It also reached number 2 on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart, behind \"Locked Out of Heaven\" by Bruno Mars. It is also their first single to be certified in the US.\nThe song was originally created during Schultz and Fraites' time in New York as a kiss-off to disinterested concert-goers. \"That song was an effort to get under people's skin at shows in Brooklyn, where everyone is pretty indifferent,\" Schultz told American Songwriter. \"And I figured if we could punctuate it with shouts we might get someone's attention.\"\n\"Ho Hey\" is written in the key of C major. A McIntosh MC240 amplifier was used in the recording.\nThe song became a commercial success and was a breakthrough hit for the Lumineers. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 90 on the week of June 10, 2012. From there, it became a sleeper hit, slowly ascending the chart until it broke into the top ten in the week of November 10, 2012 at number eight and continued to climb until it reached its peak of number 3 in its 28th week on the chart. It also remained in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks, and topped Billboard's Rock Songs chart for 14 weeks. It has also sold over four million copies in the United States as of April 2013.\nThe song also became a crossover hit, topping the Adult Pop Songs, Rock Songs, Alternative Songs, and Triple A charts and reaching number two on the Pop Songs chart, topped only by Bruno Mars' \"Locked Out of Heaven\". It also charted on the Adult Contemporary and Country Airplay charts. This multi-format success allowed it to reach number two on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and stay on the Hot 100 for 62 weeks, one of the longest chart runs ever. On the Billboard Decade-End list on Hot 100 songs in the 2010s, released on November 15, 2019, it was the lowest-ranked song in the top 100 peaking at 100. It was behind number 99, which was \"Wrecking Ball\" by Miley Cyrus, followed by \"In My Feelings\" by Drake and \"Break Your Heart\" by Taio Cruz featuring Ludacris.\nThe song also had international success, reaching the top ten in the UK, Canada, Ireland, France, Israel, Italy, Slovakia, New Zealand, Australia, and Switzerland.\n\"Ho Hey\" has received positive reviews from critics. Anne Erickson of Audio Ink Radio gave the song a rating of 4 out of 5, favorably comparing Wesley Schultz's lead vocals on the song to Raine Maida. Erickson went on to say that \"it's darn refreshing to sit back and take in some genuine, straightforward music that comes from the heart\". Rolling Stone named the song the 26th-best song of 2012.\nThe music video for \"Ho Hey\" was released on March 11, 2012. The video was directed by Ben Fee. The video shows the band walking down a hall in the former Linda Vista Hospital while singing and dancing to the song.\nPrior to its release, \"Ho Hey\" was first featured on the December 5, 2011, episode of Hart of Dixie. Later on, the song was used in a television commercial for Bing on June 1, 2012.\nIn the UK, the song has been used in an advertisement for E.ON, in the final episode of sitcom Cuckoo as well as advertisements for the film Silver Linings Playbook.\nA purely instrumental version has been used in a commercial for Blue Moon beer.\nThe song appears as a playable track in the video game Guitar Hero Live.\n\"Ho Hey\" appears in the premiere episode of the eighth season of Bones, \"The Future in the Past\", which aired September 17, 2012.\nThe song appears in the fifth episode of the tenth season of The X-Files, \"Babylon\", which aired February 15, 2016.\nReferenced in the lyrics, Canal and Bowery are cross streets in lower Manhattan, New York City, NY where bus services arrive and depart from different parts of the U.S.\nThe song appeared in The Vampire Diaries season four episode three \"The Rager\", introducing the character Hayley Marshall.\nIn the sixteenth episode of the first season of Nashville, the characters Maddie and Daphne Conrad covered \"Ho Hey\".

It was released as the album's second single on 13 December 2013 in Italy, and on 13 June 2014 in the United Kingdom. The song was co-written by Ezra with Joel Pott and produced by Cam Blackwood.\nThe single was released on Columbia Records, and distributed by Sony Music, and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. \"Budapest\" has also been a major hit for Ezra in Austria, New Zealand, and Slovenia, topping the charts in all three countries, while reaching the top ten in eleven additional countries. It was the 10th-best-selling single of 2014 in the UK. The song was released in the U.S. in 2015 and has peaked at number 32.\nEzra told The Daily Telegraph that \"Budapest\" was \"[his] first attempt to write a love song, and it uses the first three guitar chords [he] ever learned. There's a lot to be said for that simplicity.\" Ezra has also insisted that, despite its title, the lyrics of \"Budapest\" do not have anything to do with the city in Hungary and that he had never even been there before. He said, \"I was in Malm\u00f6 in Sweden and the Eurovision Song Contest was being held in Malm\u00f6 on that night, and I didn't have a clue about it but everyone there seemed to be really excited about it and having parties. But I didn't know you couldn't buy alcohol after 10 o'clock at night. So I ended up buying a bottle of like, rum, or something like that from a guy in a park so I could have something to drink at this party. Anyway, I was meant to be getting a train to Budapest the next day, and I never got it because I was too hungover and didn't fancy it. So I wrote the song about being miles from Budapest.\"\n\"Budapest\" was originally released as part of Ezra's EP Did You Hear the Rain?, which contains the song of the same name. When asked about how the song became popular, Ezra revealed, \"At first we gave it away as a free track off the/my EP for like a month, and then in Italy it just kicked off for some reason. I've never even been over there, but [the song] was just huge on the radio. It kind of happened overnight. Then it went over [to] Germany and when we released it in the UK, it took off there as well.\"\nWith a tempo of 128 bpm, the song \"Budapest\" is composed in the key of F major.\nChris Willman of Billboard called it an \"acoustically inclined, eminently hummable single\".\nIn 2015, \"Budapest\" became a sleeper hit in the United States. It debuted at number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 2015, and peaked at number 32 in May.\nAn official music video for \"Budapest\" was first released onto YouTube on 21 April 2014. It consists of a large crowd of people all with different styles and accessories all standing motionless together in a tight-knit crowd, occasionally being inter-cut with footage of one of them doing something minor like shifting slightly where they stand, one of them sneezing gaining the attention of everyone around and George playing his guitar and singing to the camera with a smile. As the video goes on, the people start to move and interact by passing their accessories around, a group of three young men having one of them bite into a very spicy chili pepper, a party attendee in a sash and tiara talking on the phone to someone, the crowd looking up together and putting on 3-D glasses, all inter-cut with George crowd-surfing them and playing and singing to the camera again.\nAs the video starts to come to an end, George begins to crowd-surf standing up instead, taking off his guitar and passing it down to join all the other accessories being passed around, this time with people interacting more and dancing together. The video ends with George singing with his guitar standing in the again-motionless crowd; when the song ends he simply stops and becomes motionless too. In a small epilogue, some members of the crowd are all on the floor silently cheering, laughing and clapping together.\nDigital download (United Kingdom)\n\"Budapest\" \u2013 3:20\nCD single (Germany)\n\"Budapest\" \u2013 3:23\n\"Angry Hill\" \u2013 4:11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mystery surrounding George Ezra and other foreign singers fuels buzz\".

It was released on June 9, 2014, and was made available for digital download on Amazon and iTunes on June 10. The single reached number one on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, making it the band's seventh number one single on the chart.\nIn an interview with the Pulse of Radio, and regarding how the single came together, lead singer Sully Erna revealed that it was written in about an hour, stating, \"It's one of those songs that surprisingly came out and was written from back to front in, like, an hour. I started putting one thing together with the next, and then Shannon Larkin started jumping in and then we arranged the whole song, and literally within an hour, maybe 90 minutes, this whole song was written and it was one of the last songs that we wrote, and it ended up becoming the first single.\"\nWhen interviewed by Full Metal Jackie, Erna offered additional details as how the single came to be, stating, \"We had been working on stuff that we had on our own and brought in. I go, 'You know what? We haven\u2019t wrote anything yet, I'm just going to write a song real quick before TC gets back from dinner.' Tony, kidding around, said, 'You should make it a real fast riff because he'll be right back.' So I started playing really fast and then all of a sudden, I was like, 'Hold on. I have something going here.' I started hearing the different movements in the chords and it just started to feel like it was coming together. Then all of a sudden, within 90 minutes the whole song kind of wrote itself.\"\nIn the same interview with the Pulse of Radio, Erna revealed that the working title for the single was \"100,000 Horsepower\", but he felt he needed to change it, explaining, \"Actually, the original title I wanted to put on the song was '100,000 Horsepower'. But unfortunately, rhythmically, it was too many syllables and I couldn't make it fit the way I wanted to creatively, so I trimmed it back to '1000 Horsepower', which is still pretty fuckin' powerful, by the way.\"\nDigital single\nOn August 12, the music video for 1000hp premiered on Shazam, a commercial smartphone-based music identification service. One day later, it premiered on Godsmack's official Vevo channel.\nOn August 4, Godsmack took the stage at the iHeartRadio Theater in New York City as part of the iHeartRadio Live Series for an intimate live performance. The show, which was streamed online, saw the band perform 1000hp live for the first time.\n\nARTISTdirect reviewer Rick Florino gave the song a favorable review and described it as a \"bombastic Boston bruiser of epic proportions\" and that \"all of the hallmarks of the band's patented sound remain intact.\" Florino concluded his review by saying, \"It's the kind of tune you could hear at sports events and during high-octane action movie set pieces for years to come. It's exactly how real rock should sound in 2014, and it's one of the best singles of the year.\" A less favorable review came from Shelly Barclay of AXS, who felt that the song was not on a par with the band's other singles, stating, \"The song does not have the same guttural edge as songs like 'Keep Away'.\" However, she went on to say that the song \"holds its own in the band's library of rock tunes.\"\nUpon its release, \"1000hp\" entered both the Billboard Mainstream Rock and Hot Rock Songs charts, peaking at number one and twenty-two, respectively. \"1000hp\" also debuted at number one on the U.S. iTunes Rock Chart.\n\n\n\nGodsmack\nSully Erna \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, producer\nTony Rombola \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals\nRobbie Merrill \u2013 bass guitar\nShannon Larkin \u2013 drums, percussion\nTechnical personnel\nDave Fortman \u2013 production, mixing\n\"Godsmack: '1000hp' Single Premiere\".

It was released on June 4, 2012, as the lead single from their debut self-titled studio album. The music video was released on March 11, 2012. \"Ho Hey\" reached number one for 18 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Rock Songs chart, as well as two weeks in the top spot on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and eight weeks in the top spot on the Adult Pop Songs chart, and reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming their first single to do so, as well as their first top 5 single. It also reached number 2 on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart, behind \"Locked Out of Heaven\" by Bruno Mars. It is also their first single to be certified in the US.\nThe song was originally created during Schultz and Fraites' time in New York as a kiss-off to disinterested concert-goers. \"That song was an effort to get under people's skin at shows in Brooklyn, where everyone is pretty indifferent,\" Schultz told American Songwriter. \"And I figured if we could punctuate it with shouts we might get someone's attention.\"\n\"Ho Hey\" is written in the key of C major. A McIntosh MC240 amplifier was used in the recording.\nThe song became a commercial success and was a breakthrough hit for the Lumineers. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 90 on the week of June 10, 2012. From there, it became a sleeper hit, slowly ascending the chart until it broke into the top ten in the week of November 10, 2012 at number eight and continued to climb until it reached its peak of number 3 in its 28th week on the chart. It also remained in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks, and topped Billboard's Rock Songs chart for 14 weeks. It has also sold over four million copies in the United States as of April 2013.\nThe song also became a crossover hit, topping the Adult Pop Songs, Rock Songs, Alternative Songs, and Triple A charts and reaching number two on the Pop Songs chart, topped only by Bruno Mars' \"Locked Out of Heaven\". It also charted on the Adult Contemporary and Country Airplay charts. This multi-format success allowed it to reach number two on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and stay on the Hot 100 for 62 weeks, one of the longest chart runs ever. On the Billboard Decade-End list on Hot 100 songs in the 2010s, released on November 15, 2019, it was the lowest-ranked song in the top 100 peaking at 100. It was behind number 99, which was \"Wrecking Ball\" by Miley Cyrus, followed by \"In My Feelings\" by Drake and \"Break Your Heart\" by Taio Cruz featuring Ludacris.\nThe song also had international success, reaching the top ten in the UK, Canada, Ireland, France, Israel, Italy, Slovakia, New Zealand, Australia, and Switzerland.\n\"Ho Hey\" has received positive reviews from critics. Anne Erickson of Audio Ink Radio gave the song a rating of 4 out of 5, favorably comparing Wesley Schultz's lead vocals on the song to Raine Maida. Erickson went on to say that \"it's darn refreshing to sit back and take in some genuine, straightforward music that comes from the heart\". Rolling Stone named the song the 26th-best song of 2012.\nThe music video for \"Ho Hey\" was released on March 11, 2012. The video was directed by Ben Fee.

The song was written by frontman Courtney Taylor-Taylor after seeing a woman pull up in her car to the traffic lights outside his apartment. It was released as the second single from the band's third studio album, Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia, on July 11, 2000.\nUpon its original release, it failed to reach the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 42, even after a yearlong tour. After featuring in a popular Vodafone advertisement, it was re-released on October 9, 2001, and peaked at No. 5 on the same chart.\nLead singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor said the song was inspired when he saw a woman in a car stopped at the traffic light below his apartment window and began to fantasize about a relationship with her. He said, \"My silly little brain ran amok with the dream of love and vintage motor malfunctions. It was only natural to weave it into a song on the spot.\"\nLouis Pattison of NME called the song \"the quintessential Dandy Warhols moment to date\". In 2011, Robert Webb of The Independent called it \"a defining song of the last decade\".\nThe A.V. Club noted the various influences from \"retro\" music present in the song, including how the guitar intro seems to imitate that of 'Little Bitch' by The Specials as well as 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' by the Rolling Stones.\nThe music video for the song, directed by Taylor-Taylor, has been the subject of controversy and is rarely broadcast on television during the day, since it contains full-frontal male and topless female nudity. However, when played on some music channels, these areas are pixelated.\nThe video shows the band playing in a karaoke bar (actually the Slabtown bar in Portland, Oregon, closed in 2014) while many different people mime to the lyrics of the song. This is intercut with a video accompanying the lyrics on the television screen at the bar. In this video, the scenes correspond with the lyrics. In the first verse, a man approaches a young woman who is fixing a car (a hearse, actually) with her friends. They both flirtatiously sing the lyrics to each other as a sign of attraction. The man is so attracted to the woman that he stares at her lower body and then visualizes her naked. Then the video switches to a waiter while he is serving a group of customers at a table. One of the girls in the group is attracted to the waiter and the two begin to flirt and mime the lyrics to the second verse. She visualizes him naked. It then turns out that the waiter and the mechanic who was fixing the car live in the same \"pad\". From the lyrics in the third verse, it is likely that the waiter is the mechanic's ex-boyfriend, as the man she was flirting with earlier is also with her. While the mechanic and her new love interest exchange a look, the woman from the restaurant emerges from a curtain wearing a nightgown. She then takes the waiter's hand and pulls him away. The video ends with the characters from the video miming the lyrics in the karaoke bar along with many other people including a man spinning a hula hoop around his waist.\nThe song has been featured in several movies, including The Replacements, Summer Catch, Igby Goes Down, Clockstoppers, Flushed Away, Little Nicky, Foolproof, Delirious, and Man of the Year. Among the television series it has been featured on are Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Numb3rs, Six Feet Under, Daria, Fresh Meat, and Chuck. A very obvious variation of the song is used as the opening theme song for the American version of the game show Cash Cab. The song was also featured in season 7 of Dancing with the Stars for Cody Linley and Julianne Hough's tango performance. For many years it has been the theme music for the BBC Radio phone-in show 6-0-6. It has also been featured in the PlayStation game Test Drive Le Mans in 2000.\nIn 2006, a mashup between the song and \"Horny\" by Mousse T. was released as the single \"Horny as a Dandy\". It reached No. 17 on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe song was the subject of a minor controversy in 2011 when British conservative politician Theresa May played the song as she walked from a conference speech. It was initially speculated that the track was \"Rocks\" by Primal Scream, who posted a statement on their website condemning her \"inappropriate\" use of their song, calling her a \"legalised bully\" and \"the enemy\".

It was released on June 4, 2012, as the second single from their second studio album of the same name. The song was written by Jeff Bhasker, Nate Ruess, Andrew Dost, and Jack Antonoff. Musically \"Some Nights\" is an indie pop song with elements of power pop and progressive pop while the lyrics depict the protagonist having an existential crisis.\nIn the United States, \"Some Nights\" was a sleeper hit, spending approximately seven months on the Billboard Hot 100 before reaching a peak of number three for six non-consecutive weeks beginning the week of September 29, 2012. The song became Fun's second single to enter the chart's top ten, as well as their second song to be certified platinum in the U.S., after their previous single, \"We Are Young\". \"Some Nights\" was successful around the world, topping the singles charts of Australia, Israel and New Zealand, and it reached the top 10 in an additional nine countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nMusically, \"Some Nights\" is an indie pop song with strong, festive elements of power pop and progressive pop. It is written in the key of C major at a tempo of 108 beats per minute. A line in their lyrics, \"this is it boys, this is war\", recalls \"99 Red Balloons\", the English version of Nena's 1983 hit \"99 Luftballons\". Lyrically, the song expresses the existential angst of a young protagonist who is a long way from home. Lead singer Nate Ruess explained to Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press: \"I'm always thinking about, 'Who am I and why did I do something like that?' And I think then it harkens back to my family, and I have such a strong tie to them and it's always therapeutic to sing about them.\" Ruess came up with the song and album title while on tour in Scotland; he wrote the song based on the title. Lyrically, the song is about \"just being someone different on any given night.\"\nThere has been some confusion with the fans as the lyric \"Some terrible nights\" was mistaken for \"...lies\". Members of Fun. confirmed on November 18, 2012 on their Twitter and Facebook accounts that \"it's NIGHTS not LIES.\" Jeff Giles, writing for Diffuser, compared the song to Simon and Garfunkel's \"Cecilia.\" Ruess commented that Simon's Graceland (1986) was an influence on the song in an interview with Billboard.\nThe Re-View calls \"Some Nights\" a \"bolder, catchier and more striking track than its predecessor \"We Are Young\", upping the stakes when it comes to both style and substance.\" In closing, he cited the track as one that would \"cement [Fun] as one of the most intriguing and exciting new bands to emerge from the States in recent years.\" The Guardian writer Dave Simpson compared Ruess's vocals in the song to those of Freddie Mercury and called the lyrics \"sincere and oddly moving\".\nRay Rahman of Entertainment Weekly, while reviewing the whole album, criticized its second half as inferior to the first and also called \"Some Nights\" the best track on the album, alongside \"We Are Young\".\nRolling Stone named the song the 11th best song of 2012.\n\"Some Nights\" has reached number one in Australia, New Zealand, and Israel. The song has also reached the top ten in the United States, Canada, Ireland, Austria, Italy, Belgium, and the United Kingdom, and has so far made the top 30 in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland; it has also charted in Japan.\nIn the United States, \"Some Nights\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 the same week their album Some Nights debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200. The song remained in the lower region of the chart for approximately four months due to low-level sales and consistent high-level streaming, before finally entering the top 40 in its 18th week. In its 23rd week, it switched places with \"We Are Young\" at number 11 on the chart, where it stayed the week after. In the song's 25th week on the chart, it entered the top ten by jumping to number 8. In its sixth week in the top ten, it reached number 3, which has been its peak position. As of March 2014, the song has sold over 5 million copies in the United States. It also reached number 2 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart, coincidentally behind Maroon 5's \"One More Night\".\nThe music video for \"Some Nights\" was produced by Poonam Sehrawat and directed by Anthony Mandler, and released on MTV.com on June 4, 2012. The video is of a fictional American Civil War night battle where the band performs on the battlefield. The lead singer, Nate Reuss, also sings as he rallies a Union regiment in preparation for"

It was released on June 4, 2012, as the lead single from their debut self-titled studio album. The music video was released on March 11, 2012. \"Ho Hey\" reached number one for 18 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Rock Songs chart, as well as two weeks in the top spot on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and eight weeks in the top spot on the Adult Pop Songs chart, and reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming their first single to do so, as well as their first top 5 single. It also reached number 2 on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart, behind \"Locked Out of Heaven\" by Bruno Mars. It is also their first single to be certified in the US.\nThe song was originally created during Schultz and Fraites' time in New York as a kiss-off to disinterested concert-goers. \"That song was an effort to get under people's skin at shows in Brooklyn, where everyone is pretty indifferent,\" Schultz told American Songwriter. \"And I figured if we could punctuate it with shouts we might get someone's attention.\"\n\"Ho Hey\" is written in the key of C major. A McIntosh MC240 amplifier was used in the recording.\nThe song became a commercial success and was a breakthrough hit for the Lumineers. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 90 on the week of June 10, 2012. From there, it became a sleeper hit, slowly ascending the chart until it broke into the top ten in the week of November 10, 2012 at number eight and continued to climb until it reached its peak of number 3 in its 28th week on the chart. It also remained in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks, and topped Billboard's Rock Songs chart for 14 weeks. It has also sold over four million copies in the United States as of April 2013.\nThe song also became a crossover hit, topping the Adult Pop Songs, Rock Songs, Alternative Songs, and Triple A charts and reaching number two on the Pop Songs chart, topped only by Bruno Mars' \"Locked Out of Heaven\". It also charted on the Adult Contemporary and Country Airplay charts. This multi-format success allowed it to reach number two on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and stay on the Hot 100 for 62 weeks, one of the longest chart runs ever. On the Billboard Decade-End list on Hot 100 songs in the 2010s, released on November 15, 2019, it was the lowest-ranked song in the top 100 peaking at 100. It was behind number 99, which was \"Wrecking Ball\" by Miley Cyrus, followed by \"In My Feelings\" by Drake and \"Break Your Heart\" by Taio Cruz featuring Ludacris.\nThe song also had international success, reaching the top ten in the UK, Canada, Ireland, France, Israel, Italy, Slovakia, New Zealand, Australia, and Switzerland.\n\"Ho Hey\" has received positive reviews from critics. Anne Erickson of Audio Ink Radio gave the song a rating of 4 out of 5, favorably comparing Wesley Schultz's lead vocals on the song to Raine Maida. Erickson went on to say that \"it's darn refreshing to sit back and take in some genuine, straightforward music that comes from the heart\". Rolling Stone named the song the 26th-best song of 2012.\nThe music video for \"Ho Hey\" was released on March 11, 2012. The video was directed by Ben Fee. The video shows the band walking down a hall in the former Linda Vista Hospital while singing and dancing to the song.\nPrior to its release, \"Ho Hey\" was first featured on the December 5, 2011, episode of Hart of Dixie. Later on, the song was used in a television commercial for Bing on June 1, 2012.\nIn the UK, the song has been used in an advertisement for E.ON, in the final episode of sitcom Cuckoo as well as advertisements for the film Silver Linings Playbook.\nA purely instrumental version has been used in a commercial for Blue Moon beer.\nThe song appears as a playable track in the video game Guitar Hero Live.\n\"Ho Hey\" appears in the premiere episode of the eighth season of Bones, \"The Future in the Past\", which aired September 17, 2012.\nThe song appears in the fifth episode of the tenth season of The X-Files, \"Babylon\", which aired February 15, 2016.\nReferenced in the lyrics, Canal and Bowery are cross streets in lower Manhattan, New York City, NY where bus services arrive and depart from different parts of the U.S.\nThe song appeared in The Vampire Diaries season four episode three \"The Rager\", introducing the character Hayley Marshall.\nIn the sixteenth episode of the first season of Nashville, the characters Maddie and Daphne Conrad covered \"Ho Hey\".

                "unshown_background": ": Infobox song. cover: . genre: Traditional English song, Child Ballad. language: English. misc: . name: Riddles Wisely Expounded. prev_title: . released: . writer: . written: 1450. \"Riddles Wisely Expounded\" is a traditional English song, dating at least to 1450. It is Child Ballad 1 and Roud 161, and exists in several variants. The first known tune was attached to it in 1719. The title \"Riddles Wisely Expounded\" was given by Francis James Child and seems derived from the seventeenth century broadside version \"A Noble Riddle Wisely Expounded\".\nThe motif of riddling in folklore is very ancient, the stories of Oedipus and Samson giving two early examples. The particular form used here matches the folktale Aarne-Thompson type 875 The Clever Girl where a woman wins a husband by her clever answers to riddles. Other tales of this type include What Is the Fastest Thing in the World? and The Wise Little Girl. There are strong parallels with ballads in other languages, with many German, and Scottish and Irish Gaelic versions known to exist. There is also significant crossover with other popular English language ballads, such as The Two Sisters (Child 10) and The False Knight on the Road (Child 3) and The Elfin Knight (Child 2).\nIn the earliest surviving version of the song, the \"foul fiend\" proposes to abduct a maiden unless she can answer a series of riddles. The woman prays to Jesus for wisdom, and answers the riddles correctly.\nWol ye here a wonder thynge (\"Will you hear a wondrous story,)\nBetwyxt a mayd and the fovle fende? (Between a maid and the foul fiend (Devil)?\")\nThys spake the fend to the mayd: (Thus spoke the fiend (Devil) to the maid:)\n\n'Beleue on me, mayd, to day. (\"Believe on me, maid, today.\")\n'What ys hyer than ys [the] tre? (\"What is higher than is the tree?)\nWhat ys dypper than ys the see? (What is deeper than is the sea?\")\n'What ys scharpper than ys the thorne? (\"What is sharper than is the thorn?)\nWhat ys loder than ys the horne? (What is louder than is the horn?\")\n'What [ys] longger than ys the way? (\"What is longer(broader) than is the way?)\nWhat is rader than ys the day? (What is redder than is the day?)\n'Hewene ys heyer than ys the tre, (\"Heaven is higher than is the tree)\nHelle ys dypper than ys the see. (Hell is deeper than is the sea.)\n'Hongyr ys scharpper than [ys] the thorne, (\"Hunger is sharper than is the thorn,)\nThonder ys lodder than ys the horne. (Thunder is louder than is the horn.)\n'Loukynge ys longer than ys the way, (Looking is longer(broader) than is the way,)\nSyn ys rader than ys the day. (Sin is redder than is the day.)\nIn a seventeenth century version entitled \"A Noble Riddle Wisely Expounded\", the words of each verse are interspersed with a chorus phrase \"lay the bent to the bonny broom\". A. L. Lloyd  euphemistically describes this as a phrase of \"physiological significance\", explaining that the word \"bent\" means a horn. \"Broom\" most likely refers to the flowering shrub. This version is very similar to The Two Sisters (Child 10).\n'If thou canst answer me questions three,\nLay the bent to the bonny broom\nThis very day will I marry thee.'\n\nFa la la la, fa la la la ra re\nIn later versions, including this one, a knight puts a woman to test before he marries her (sometimes after seducing her); the woman knows the answers, and wins the marriage. In other versions, a devil disguised as a knight tries to carry the woman off.\nThe riddles vary, but typical ones include:\nWhat is longer than the way? -- love\nWhat is deeper than the sea? -- hell\nWhat is louder than the horn?  -- thunder\nWhat is sharper than a thorn? -- hunger\nWhat is whiter than milk? -- snow\nWhat is softer than silk? -- down\nWhat is worse than woman was? -- the devil\nThe most commonly found traditional version in recent times, usually entitled \"Ninety-nine and ninety\", begins roughly as follows:\nNow you must answer my questions nine\nSing ninety-nine and ninety,\nOr you aren't God's you are one of mine\nAnd who is the weaver's bonny.\nWhat is whiter than milk?\nSing ninety-nine and ninety;\nAnd what is softer than silk?\n\nAnd who is the weaver's bonny.\nTraditional recordings of this version have been made several times in the twentieth century. American recordings include those performed by the Appalachian traditional singer Texas Gladden (recorded by Alan and Elizabeth Lomax in 1941) Nancy Philley of Fayetteville, Arkansas (1963) and Alfreda Peel of Salem, Virginia (1932). Jeff Wesley of Whittlebury, Northamptonshire, England (1988) sang a very similar version, suggesting that this popular version came from England relatively recently.\n\nModern literary retellings include Juniper, Gentian, and Rosemary by Pamela Dean and \"A Diorama of the Infernal Regions, or the Devil's Ninth Question,\" by Andy Duncan.\nList of the Child Ballads\nThe Fause Knight Upon the Road\nThe Elfin Knight\nProud Lady Margaret\nThe Riddle Song\nFrancis James Child, \"Riddles Wisely Expounded\"\nFrancis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v"

It was released on July 7, 2003 by Jive Records as the fourth single from the album. He co-wrote the track with its producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo of The Neptunes. According to Timberlake, the song was influenced by Stevie Wonder. Musically, \"Se\u00f1orita\" is an R&B, pop, and jazz up-tempo ballad, featuring an electric piano strut, cowbell in beat of the song, and a rhythm section. The song has been described as a Spanish \"number\" with a \"Latin flavored\" cut beat. In the track, Timberlake sings about a woman, whose attention he is trying to capture. \"Se\u00f1orita\" received positive reviews from music critics, who commented on the track's general sound and lyrics.\nCommercially, the song peaked within the top ten in Australia and New Zealand, the top twenty in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, and the top thirty in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. Its music video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the category for Best Male Video in 2004.\n\"Se\u00f1orita\" was co-written by Justin Timberlake, and The Neptunes' Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo. Before the release of Timberlake's solo album, Justified, Timberlake and the album's producers, Williams and Hugo, gave MTV News a preview of the record in August 2002. While in discussion of \"Se\u00f1orita\", Hugo said that he expected the song to make the track listing of Justified. In another interview, Timberlake revealed that the song was influenced by singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder. Timberlake said that the song had \"that groove that really fits into the summer\". While in development, Timberlake said he was \"beatboxing the notes\". He wrote the song imagining a \"dark-skinned, voluptuous lady whose attention he is trying to capture.\"\n\"Se\u00f1orita\" is a \"Spanish number\" infused with an R&B, up-tempo ballad. The song has been described as a fast \"hot mid-tempo\" and dance song. The song is composed in the key of E\u266d minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 96 beats per minute. The music begins with an electric piano strut, that provides the main chordal accompaniment. A cowbell chimes, in beat of the song, in the background. Timberlake sings in a \"reasonable falsetto vamping\". The song's musicscape also features hand claps, a rhythm section, and \"cruises on an unconventional reedy rhythm and crackling beat\", according to Chuck Cavalaris of The Knoxville News-Sentinel. The track is also considered a \"blues inflected track\", and a dance jam. Kevin O'Hare of the Sunday Republican said the song is \"a Latin-flavored cut with a pronounced beat\". Lisa Rose of The Star-Ledger commented that the song has a \"jazz-funk\u00a0... embellished with a ground-rumbling beat and horn section solos.\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram said that the song has a \"minimalist funk strut\", while a contributor of the New Straits Times said that the single is \"a funk song with an organic feel \u2013 and quite close to Stevie Wonder's soulful style.\"\nAccording to Teresa Gubbins of The Dallas Morning News, she described the theme of the song as Timberlake singing about a girl with brown eyes. O'Hare noted that there are \"some very amusing\" improvisations as Timberlake guides the \"guys and the ladies though their background vocal segment.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic also reported that Timberlake exhorts \"the fellas and ladies\" in \"Se\u00f1orita\" to sing separately \"in a cringe-worthy affectation\". He directs the men to sing, \"It feels like something's heatin' up. Can I leave with you?\" and the women to sing, \"I don't know what I'm thinking bout / really leavin wit you.\"\nMusic critic David Browne of Entertainment Weekly, in review of the album, wrote: \"In the latter category, he's more engaging\u2014the stud on the loose, making promises of romance and more in slurpy cuts like 'Senorita' and 'Rock Your Body'.\" Denise Boyd of the BBC wrote: \"The introduction [of] 'Senorita' immediately grabs your attention.\" Tyler Martin of Stylus said that the song's rhythm section was \"brilliant, a simple, yet distinctive beat that could only come from the Neptunes. The song allows for much amusement in the last minute and a half with a sing-along that is more wonderful and surprising than most artists have offered us this year.\" Jonathan Takiff of the Philadelphia Daily"

The song was released on December 31, 2014, and was the first song released by West since the release of his sixth studio album Yeezus.\nBoth artists co-wrote the song with Kirby Lauryen, Noah Goldstein, and Mike Dean. The song is a tribute to West's daughter, North, and is sung as a message to Kanye from the perspective of his mother, Donda West. McCartney is featured on the track as a musician and can be heard on \"faint\" and electronically manipulated backing vocals, but does not sing any lead vocal part.\nThe song was recorded over a two-day period in Mexico in September 2014 in which West and McCartney, alongside other artists, recorded upwards of nine songs.\nThe track was released on December 31, 2014, to the iTunes Store. The track features English musician and former member of the Beatles and Wings, Paul McCartney, and was the first of two rumored collaborations between the two artists, the other being a track called \"Piss On Your Grave\". \"Only One\" was the first of three McCartney\u2013West collaborations to be released commercially, as the two would later appear on \"FourFiveSeconds\" alongside singer Rihanna, released just twenty-four days after \"Only One\", as well as on West's \"All Day\". \"Only One\" also features uncredited vocals from Ty Dolla $ign.\nKanye West is described in a press release as not being able to remember singing the words to \"Only One\" when he and McCartney were later reviewing the early 2014 sessions that generated the song. Later, West \"realized that perhaps the words had never really come from him \u2026 he understood in that moment that his late mother, Dr. Donda West, who was also his mentor, confidante, and best friend, had spoken through him that day ... A message had been passed down through generations.\" In the song Kanye is singing from the perspective of his mother Donda West, who died in 2007.\nWest's wife Kim Kardashian tweeted upon the release of the track that it is her favorite track by West, saying, \"People always ask me what my favorite Kanye song is and it's 'Only One'.

It was given a discretionary warning by Epilepsy Action, stating that the video \"potentially triggers seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy\". West and Rihanna performed the song at the 2011 NBA All-Star Game, while it was also featured in the promo for the same event.\n\"All of the Lights\" was written by Kanye West, Jeff Bhasker, Malik Jones, Warren Trotter, Stacy Ferguson and Terius Nash. Its production was helmed by West himself and co-produced by Bhasker. Fourteen artists lent their voices as background vocals to the song: Alicia Keys, John Legend, The-Dream, Drake, Fergie, Kid Cudi, Elton John, Ryan Leslie, Charlie Wilson, Tony Williams, La Roux, Alvin Fields, Ken Lewis, and Rihanna, who also sang the song's hook and is labeled as a featured artist on the single version. West and Rihanna previously collaborated with Jay-Z on \"Run This Town\" (The Blueprint 3, 2009).\nThe early working title for \"All of The Lights\" was previously \"Ghetto University\" when the production on the song was just beginning. During the 2010 MTV Europe Music Awards, on November 10, 2010, Rihanna was interviewed by MTV News' staff. In the interview she explained that, West already played his album to her three months ago and that \"All of the Lights\" was one of her favorite songs. About it, she further commented, \"So when he asked me to come up to the studio at 2 o'clock in the morning, I had to, because I loved it, I knew it was that song.\"\nIn an interview for the same publication, Elly Jackson said of the song's vocal layering, \"He got me to layer up all these vocals with other people, and he just basically wanted to use his favorite vocalists from around the world to create this really unique vocal texture on his record, but it's not the kind of thing where you can pick it out\". Andrew Dawson, Anthony Kilhoffer, Mike Dean, HI and Noah Goldstein recorded West's vocals at Avex Recording Studios in Honolulu, Hawaii and Electric Lady Studios in New York City. Rihanna's vocals were recorded by Marcos Tovar at the Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California.\nIn a 2013 interview with The Breakfast Club, West said that the song took two years to finish, and detailed the creation and process of the song;  \n\"'All The Lights' is a futurist song that started out as a Jeezy record with horns on it, then we put in another bridge, then Dream wrote the hook, then Rihanna sang it, and by the time you got it, it was to the level of like, the Nike Flyknit or something like that.\nEven though not fully leaked, \"All of the Lights\" was featured for the first time on \"Runaway\"\u2014a 35-minute film about West's \"true labor of love\" which was released on October 23, 2010. The song was featured in the film together with other songs from West's then-upcoming fifth studio album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), including \"Monster\", \"Power\" and \"Lost in the World\" among others. The song fully leaked on November 4, 2010,"

It was released in the United States on 14 April 2014 and in the United Kingdom on 18 May 2014. \"Stay with Me\" is a gospel-inspired ballad that details the protagonist pleading with their one-night stand not to leave them. The song was written by Smith, James Napier, and William Phillips, with Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne later receiving co-writer credits due to the song's noted melodic similarity to Petty's single \"I Won't Back Down\".\nThe song has become Smith's most successful single to date, peaking at number one in the UK Singles Chart (becoming Smith's third chart-topper there, second as a solo artist), topping the charts in Canada and New Zealand, and reaching number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has also reached top 10 status in over twelve countries worldwide. At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, Darkchild's version of \"Stay with Me\" won two Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\nIn an interview with NME, Smith said that the song was written in a studio in Old Street with James Napier (Jimmy Napes) and William Phillips (also known as \"Tourist\"). Phillips started playing with three chords on the piano, and Napier quickly provided a drum pattern, and according to Smith, \"the song just flowed out of us so naturally,\" and the song was written in 30 to 40 minutes.  After finishing the song, Smith started to layer their vocals about 20 times, singing in different parts of the studio and harmonizing. The result sounded like a gospel choir, but all from Smith's own voice, and this demo was then used in the released song.\nAccording to Smith, \"the song is about the moment in the morning after a one night stand, where the person you are with leaves your house, and you are left by yourself, and it's just a second, where you are just like: 'I wish, I wish'. You don't even love them, you don't really fancy them that much, it's just nice to have someone in the bed next to you.\" The song won the Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, and in their acceptance speech for winning the Record of the Year, Smith said that \"I want to thank the man who this record is about who I fell in love with last year. Thank you so much for breaking my heart because you got me four Grammys.\"\nOn 25 March 2014, the song was played for the first time on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show at 7:30\u00a0pm. On 29 March, they performed the song live on Saturday Night Live in the United States. On 16 May, they performed the song on The Graham Norton Show. In June, they returned to the United States as part of their tour where they performed the song on Good Morning America, at the Apollo Theater in New York with Mary J. Blige, and David Letterman.\nIn January 2015, it was revealed that a settlement had been reached with Tom Petty's publishing company to add Petty and Jeff Lynne as co-writers, and that they would receive a 12.5% songwriting credit. Petty's publisher contacted Smith's team after it noticed a likeness between \"Stay with Me\" and the melody of Petty's 1989 song \"I Won't Back Down\". Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith intentionally plagiarized him, saying \"All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times, you catch it before it gets out the studio door, but in this case, it got by. Sam's people were very understanding of our predicament and we easily came to an agreement.\" According to Smith, they had never heard \"I Won't Back Down\" before they wrote \"Stay with Me\", but they acknowledged the similarity after listening to the song, and said that the likeness was \"a complete coincidence\". Petty and Lynne, however, were not eligible for a Grammy as the Recording Academy considered \"Stay with Me\" to have been interpolated from \"I Won't Back Down\" by Napier, Phillips and Smith; instead Petty and Lynne would be given certificates to honor their contribution to the work, as is usual for writers of sampled or interpolated work.\nIn music notation, \"Stay with Me\" is written in the key of C major; an accidental-free key signature with chord progressions of Am\u2077\u2013F\u2013C, that are persistant throughout the entire song. The song is composed in common (4/4) time signature, and played at a tempo of 84 beats per minute (bpm), all according to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing.\n\"Stay with Me\" was written by Smith, James Napier, William Phillips, with additional"

Azalea co-wrote the song with Maegan Cottone, British girl group Little Mix, and the song's producers, The Invisible Men. The single was released on May 4, 2015, by RCA Records.\nThe music video for \"Pretty Girls\" premiered on May 13, 2015, and was directed by Azalea and Cameron Duddy. The visuals were inspired by the 1988 film Earth Girls Are Easy, starring Geena Davis. The song was performed live by Spears and Azalea for the first time on May 17 at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards. Later that year, it was added to the setlist for Spears' Las Vegas residency show, Britney: Piece of Me.\nThe collaboration peaked within the top 20 in the United Kingdom, Canada, Hungary, Scotland, and South Korea as well as the top 30 in the United States, France, and Australia. The track also received two nominations at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards.\nOn September 9, 2014, during an interview with Extra at The Intimate Britney Spears Collection launch in New York City, Spears revealed she had slowly but steadily started working on a new album. When asked who she would like to collaborate with, Spears said she would like to do something with Katy Perry or Iggy Azalea. Rumors began to circulate that a collaboration between the two artists was already in the works, with Azalea saying she had done a \"secret collaboration\" with someone she had been interested in.\nIn December 2014, Azalea told Kiss 108 backstage at their Jingle Ball Tour 2014 that their collaborative song would premiere in 2015, \"We have a song, which is going to be her first single, coming out next year.\" Asked how the collaboration came about, Azalea added, \"She said she would like to work with me in an interview and they reached out. We recorded a few different things and then one of those just ended up being, I think, undeniably great. Hopefully I think everybody will get to hear it at the beginning of next year.\" In February 2015, Azalea tweeted there were \"epic\" ongoing plans for the song. For Spears's Billboard magazine cover story, published online on March 12, 2015, it was reported that despite Spears being back in the recording studio as back as in September 2014 working on a duet with Azalea, among other tracks, a proper full-length album would not be coming soon. Spears further explained, \"I'm gonna do [a new album] slowly but surely [...] I'm gonna try to do my best to do an amazing album, but it's not my full priority right now\". Azalea confirmed the title of the track the following week. Afterwards, in Spears's cover story with People magazine, it was announced that \"Pretty Girls\" would be released on May 5.\nOn March 29, 2015, on the red carpet of the 2nd iHeartRadio Music Awards in Los Angeles, Azalea confirmed \"Pretty Girls\" would be featured on Spears's upcoming album during an interview with MTV News and explained the song's evolution mentioning its final version being a real duet with her also joining Spears on the chorus instead of a usual featured rapping. When describing the song in an interview with USA Today, Azalea said, \"It's just a lot of fun. It's a classic, girly (song) you want to scream to each other when you're getting ready\". Although the collaboration was finished in fall 2014, Azalea did not meet Spears in person until January 2015, when she invited Spears to her house for lunch.\nOn April 30, 2015, the single artwork, an illustration of the artists in an outer space background referring to the '80s film Earth Girls Are Easy, was unveiled online. Portions of the song began surfacing on the internet later that day, and the song leaked in its entirety on May 2, 2015, two days prior to its official release. On May 3, 2015, Spears announced she had teamed up with Uber to give fans an early listen of the song. For six hours between 3pm-9pm PDT on that day, requesters in Los Angeles were able to ride select Britney-themed vehicles called \"Bees\" while listening to the song and have a chance to win surprise gifts and tickets to her show, Britney: Piece of Me in Las Vegas.\nOn May 4, 2015, \"Pretty Girls\" was released for digital download, with anticipating fans trending the hashtag #PrettyGirls on Twitter.\n\"Pretty Girls\" received mixed to positive reviews from contemporary music critics and fans.

The song fuses R&B with dub step, reggae, pop, drum & bass elements, whilst also sampling the hook from The Fugees' 1996 single \"Fu-Gee-La\", which itself is based on Teena Marie's 1988 hit \"Ooo La La La\".\nThe single was featured on Digital Spy's 10 tracks you need to hear Playlist. So So Gay listed it on their Singles of the Week.\n\n\"Here's to Everything\" was written by Misha B and Talay Riley and produced by Scribz Riley. According to Misha, the concept of the track is \"here's to all the lows that make beautiful highs\". On sampling, she revealed that Lauryn Hill is one of her musical inspirations; \"I had to be cautious, she's one of my inspirations.\"\nIn an interview with on BBC 1xtra Misha B informed CJ Beatz that from the age of nine she had always wanted to produce a song about \"what life meant to me\", to \"write a song entitled or just surrounding the concept here\u2019s to everything\"; the track is a \"toast to life! It\u2019s a feel good song celebrating everything life throws at you. I loved making it and had been waiting to write a song like this for ages. Here it is! Here\u2019s to everything!\".\nSoul Culture noted that \"the upbeat single\" was fused R&B with reggae, pop, drum & bass elements, while Digital Spy mentioned \"bouncy drums that burst on the drum 'n' bass-pop chorus\". Misha B described the sound of the track as \"dub step infused with a splash reggae and dance\", with \"a dancey reggae style which I hope will get everyone dancing. Reggae is a style close to my heart, and I love to draw on my Jamaican roots. So Drums and rhythm are a real priority to me.\"\nOn 8 February 2013, Misha B announced that \"Here's to Everything (Ooh La La)\" would be released as the third single from her forthcoming debut album. On 15 February 2013, the song received its worldwide premier on The Hits Radio. On 19 March 2013, the artwork was released.\nThe single has had mixed reviews. 4music wrote a positive review, commenting, \"With lyrics like Dee Dee Dee Dee Dum and Ooh La La, the song is lighthearted, optimistic and is sure to put you in a good mood.\" Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave the song 3 out of 5 stars in a mixed-to-positive review saying that \"The sentiment may not be the most original, but come summer, we'll no doubt find ourselves raising a glass or two, or three...\" Mark Blankenship of NewNowNext.com wrote a positive review calling it  \"a heart-exploding command to dance your ass off and have a good time.\" Sarah Dean writing for Huffingtonpost called the track \"perfect happy music\" and regarded it as the closest the UK is going to get to a Nicki Minaj hit at the moment. EQ Music Blog reviewed it as an upbeat tune and a \"monster swaggering anthem set by a drum and bass beat... It\u2019s going to make you bump, bump, your hump, hump resolutely in happiness at it\u2019s [sic] every which way, crash and bang burst of positivity.\" Greg White of So So Gay labelled the single as \"a booming, drum n bass, pop number that\u2019s obviously vying to be a song of the summer.\"  Whilst noting that the track was \"slick and well-crafted\", he didn't find the song catchy and labelled it generic. He also expressed that it was too similar to Rihanna's sound and that Misha B tried too hard to flavour the track with a thick island accent. He continued to say that her signature \"powerful and heartfelt\" vocals were not present and labelled the lyrics as \"extremely common\" and lacking personality. Paul Leake of ClickMusic.com stated that with each single release she delivers a \"quality far above the norm for an X Factor alum.\" He went on to praise the track, which shows off \"both her talent as a pop artist and her musical influences, occasionally colliding with mixed results\". However, he thought the sampling felt \"more calculated than shrewd\".\nMisha B performed this song live on Blue Peter. She also performed acoustic versions for several music sites including grammy.com, the Virgin Red Room (Virgin Group), Kiss 100 London, Shazam.com and Planet Notion.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Here's To Everything (Ooh La La)\" debuted on the UK R&B Chart at number 7 on 5 May 2013. It also entered the UK Singles Chart at number 35 in the same week, but did not stay in the top 40.\n\nThe music video was directed by Justin Dickel and produced by Alex Bedford, and was filmed from 24 to 26 February 2013.

Eriksen\nTor Erik Hermansen\nShaffer Smith. \"Take a Bow\" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna for Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded (2008), the re-release of her third studio album Good Girl Gone Bad (2007). The song was written and produced by Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel Eriksen, and Shaffer Smith under their stage names StarGate and Ne-Yo. \"Take a Bow\" was released as the first single on April 15, 2008, from the re-release and the fifth single overall from the two releases. It is an R&B song that contains elements of dance-pop. Critical reception of \"Take a Bow\" was mixed, with some critics praising the song's lyrics and powerful balladry, while others criticized StarGate's production as unoriginal.\nIn the US, the song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became Rihanna's third song to do so. \"Take a Bow\" also peaked at number one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and US Pop Songs chart, and has been certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The song reached number one in Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom, and attained top five positions in Australia, New Zealand, and Norway. Its accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler and presents Rihanna as the female protagonist who leaves her boyfriend because of his infidelity. Rihanna performed \"Take a Bow\" on \"AOL Music Sessions\" and was included on the set lists of the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour (2008\u201309), Last Girl on Earth (2010\u201311), Loud Tour (2011) and Diamonds World Tour (2013).\n\"Take a Bow\" was written and produced by StarGate and Ne-Yo. The song premiered on March 14, 2008, on the KIIS-FM radio show On Air with Ryan Seacrest. \"Take a Bow\" was released as the fifth overall single from Good Girl Gone Bad, but the first from the re-release of the album, entitled Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded. \"Take a Bow\" was made available to purchase in media outlets, via Def Jam Recordings' website, on the same day as its radio premiere in the United States later being made available to download via iTunes on May 6, 2008. The song is written in the key of E major and is set in simple time with a metronome of 82 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of E\u2083 to the high note of C\u266f\u2085. Musically, it is a R&B song that also incorporates elements of dance-pop, whilst lyrically, \"Take a Bow\" tells of how the female protagonist expresses disinterest in rekindling her relationship with a dishonorable and unfaithful ex-boyfriend.\n\"Take a Bow\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Upon the song's release as an official single, Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented its choice for the promotion of Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, writing that the singer could have chosen \"Breakin' Dishes\" which served as a promotional single for Good Girl Gone Bad and charted at number four on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart in February 2008\u2014but had opted for \"Take a Bow\" due to it being new and more likely to find a receptive audience. Levine continued in his review to write that although the ballad succeeds in its mission of telling of a failed relationship, he noted that the song was not at the same level as the singer's previous single, \"Don't Stop the Music\" (2007). Levine cited that his reason for this was that \"'Take a Bow' does what it sets out to do very well, but it's an underwhelming follow-up to the dancefloor rush of 'Don't Stop The Music'\". Levine also commented on the song with regard to the other new songs included on the re-release, \"Disturbia\" and \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" (a collaboration with Maroon 5), as part of his review of Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, writing that \"Take a Bow\" is inferior to the former, but superior to the latter. Natalie Zfat of Rolling Stone gave it three and a half out of five stars.\n\nIn the United States, the song leaped 52 positions from number 53 to number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on May 14, 2008, with digital download sales of 267,000 copies, which prompted the song to debut at number one on the US Hot Digital Songs chart. With \"Take a Bow\" jumping fifty-two positions to number one, this marked the second largest leap to number one in the history of the chart as of May 2008, second only to Maroon 5's \"Makes Me Wonder\", which leaped from number 64 to number one in May 2007. Additionally, at the time of release, Rihanna held two of the top three opening week download"

It was released as the third single from Tragic Kingdom in the United States on April 15, 1996, by Interscope Records. Lead singer Gwen Stefani and her brother Eric Stefani, former No Doubt member, wrote the song originally as a love song. The song went through several rewrites and new versions. Gwen modified it into a breakup song about her bandmate and ex-boyfriend Tony Kanal, shortly after he ended their seven-year relationship.\nDespite the song's popularity, \"Don't Speak\" did not chart on the US Billboard Hot 100 (as rules of the times required commercial singles for charting and one was not issued for the song), but it did reach number one on the Hot 100 Airplay chart for 16 weeks. Outside the United States, it topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, becoming No Doubt's most successful international single. \"Don't Speak\" was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 40th Grammy Awards.\n\"Don't Speak\" was ranked at number 495 on Blender magazine's \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\". The song is a playable track in the 2009 video game Band Hero, and is also included as a downloadable song in 2008's Rock Band 2. The song has been sampled by multiple hip hop artists, including in Rakim's song \"Dedicated\" and Ice Cube's \"War & Peace\".\n\"Don't Speak\" was written by lead singer Gwen Stefani and her brother Eric Stefani, and produced by Matthew Wilder. Originally a love song, Stefani rewrote the lyrics almost completely after her breakup with the band's bass player Tony Kanal. According to her, \"It used to be more upbeat, more of a Seventies rock-type thing. [When] Tony and I broke up... it turned into a sad song.\" A live version that exists from April 1994 shows off a bouncy tune that has the same skeleton as the released version, but not the same urgency. The band performed part of the original song on VH1 Storytellers on August 10, 2000.\n\nThe band's lead guitarist Tom Dumont said about the song's composition: \n There's a lot of stories about that song, because that one unfolded over a longer period of time. Originally, Gwen's brother wrote most of that song, and then after we got at it as a band, Gwen changed the lyrics around to fit her life. Musically, we brought it to another level, but near the end we reworded it. There's an earlier version of the song where the verses are totally different, which is a really beautiful version and it's awesome but it's way more jazzy and really different. That song had a long incubation process.\n\"Don't Speak\" is composed in the key of C minor and F minor. A demo version also appeared on a demo CD, which was presented to Interscope Records prior to the release of Tragic Kingdom.\nUpon release, \"Don't Speak\" immediately began to receive extensive airplay and it eventually became the most widely played song on American radio in 1996. It reached number one on Billboard's Hot 100 Airplay chart and maintained that position for 16 non-consecutive weeks, a record at the time. Although the record would be broken in 1998 by the Goo Goo Dolls's single \"Iris\" with 18 weeks at number one, and again in 2020 by The Weeknd's single Blinding Lights with 20 weeks at number one, the song remains in third place of songs with the most weeks at number one on the Hot 100 Airplay. For all its airplay though, \"Don't Speak\" was not allowed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 as no commercial single was released for it in the United States (a requirement for charting purposes at the time). Slate magazine music critic Chris Molanphy has stated that if the song had been eligible to chart, it almost certainly would have claimed the number one spot.\n\"Don't Speak\" also stayed at number two on Alternative Airplay chart for five consecutive weeks, blocked by the band Bush's single \"Swallowed\". The song also proved to be a crossover hit, reaching number one on the Adult Top 40 chart for 15 consecutive weeks as well as numbers six and nine on the Adult Contemporary and Rhythmic charts, respectively. It was ultimately placed at number one on the Hot 100 Airplay year-end chart of 1997.\nInternationally, \"Don't Speak\" was also very successful. In February 1997, it peaked at number one in both the United Kingdom and Ireland for three weeks. Elsewhere in Europe,"

The track reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart on release in October 2001. Singer Gruff Rhys has described the song as being about \"rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution\".\nCritical reaction to the track was generally positive with many reviewers comparing the song to the work of other groups such as Status Quo, ELO and The Beach Boys. A promotional music video was produced to accompany \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\"'s release as a single. Directed by Pedro Romhanyi the video features images of fictional television stations including \"SFA TV\", which shows the band playing along with the track. An alternative video, directed by Sean Hillen, was included on the DVD version of Rings Around the World on its release in July 2001. This video features the lyrics to the track scrolling slowly from the bottom of the screen upwards in front of an image of a globe. The DVD version of Rings Around the World also includes a Llwybr Llaethog remix of \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\".\nAccording to lead vocalist Gruff Rhys, \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is about \"all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around. If you could visualize all the things we don't see, Earth could look like some kind of fucked-up Saturn. And that's the idea I have in my head\u00a0\u2013 surrounded by communication lines and traffic and debris thrown out of spaceships.\" Rhys has claimed that the theory was initially his girlfriend's father's. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.\n\"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is 3 minutes 29 seconds long and is in the key of B major. The track begins with feedback which plays while drums and a guitar, playing a riff based around a B chord, fade in. The first verse begins on 25 seconds with Gruff Rhys singing the lines \"You expose the film in me, we're drawing rings around the world\" backed by harmony vocals on the title phrase. A short bridge plays, during which the guitar chords change from B, E and F\u266f to just E, F\u266f, E, F\u266f. Another verse, bridge and verse play before the last bridge which begins at 1 minute 23 seconds. The outro starts at 1 minute 32 seconds with Rhys singing \"Ring ring, ring ring, rings around the world\" over the chords B, D and F\u266f backed by harmony vocals. A guitar counter-melody begins at 2 minutes 2 seconds and excerpts from phone calls the band made to random people around the world, including calls to the United States embassies in Madagascar and Moscow, a record shop in Osaka and a record company in Australia, play as the track fades out.\nA Llwybr Llaethog remix of \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is included on the DVD version of Rings Around The World. The track is 3 minutes 33 seconds in length and begins with a reed organ playing a riff in the key of B major. The remix largely follows the arrangement of the original but, for the majority of its duration, dispenses with the instrumental backing, featuring just Gruff Rhys's main vocals, the band's backing vocals and excerpts from the random phonecalls the group made alongside occasional organ and cymbals. Towards the end of the track the original version's guitar, drums and bass appear briefly before the song ends with the same reed organ riff that appeared at the start.\nCritical reaction to \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" was generally positive with many journalists comparing the song to the work of other groups. Writing for the NME, Ted Kessler described the track as \"Status Quo for Generation X-ers with a Manhattan Portage full of millennial tension\" and went on to ask \"who said there was anything wrong with that?\" in his review of the song on its release as a single, despite his earlier review of Rings Around the World claiming that the album would benefit from the removal of the \"Status Quo-ish title track\". Q described the track as \"excellent\" while PopMatters claimed the song \"sounds so much like ELO that it blows away everything on last year's ELO reunion album\" and the Dallas Observer stated that \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is a \"Beach"

According to her, \"It used to be more upbeat, more of a Seventies rock-type thing. [When] Tony and I broke up... it turned into a sad song.\" A live version that exists from April 1994 shows off a bouncy tune that has the same skeleton as the released version, but not the same urgency. The band performed part of the original song on VH1 Storytellers on August 10, 2000.\n\nThe band's lead guitarist Tom Dumont said about the song's composition: \n There's a lot of stories about that song, because that one unfolded over a longer period of time. Originally, Gwen's brother wrote most of that song, and then after we got at it as a band, Gwen changed the lyrics around to fit her life. Musically, we brought it to another level, but near the end we reworded it. There's an earlier version of the song where the verses are totally different, which is a really beautiful version and it's awesome but it's way more jazzy and really different. That song had a long incubation process.\n\"Don't Speak\" is composed in the key of C minor and F minor. A demo version also appeared on a demo CD, which was presented to Interscope Records prior to the release of Tragic Kingdom.\nUpon release, \"Don't Speak\" immediately began to receive extensive airplay and it eventually became the most widely played song on American radio in 1996. It reached number one on Billboard's Hot 100 Airplay chart and maintained that position for 16 non-consecutive weeks, a record at the time. Although the record would be broken in 1998 by the Goo Goo Dolls's single \"Iris\" with 18 weeks at number one, and again in 2020 by The Weeknd's single Blinding Lights with 20 weeks at number one, the song remains in third place of songs with the most weeks at number one on the Hot 100 Airplay. For all its airplay though, \"Don't Speak\" was not allowed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 as no commercial single was released for it in the United States (a requirement for charting purposes at the time). Slate magazine music critic Chris Molanphy has stated that if the song had been eligible to chart, it almost certainly would have claimed the number one spot.\n\"Don't Speak\" also stayed at number two on Alternative Airplay chart for five consecutive weeks, blocked by the band Bush's single \"Swallowed\". The song also proved to be a crossover hit, reaching number one on the Adult Top 40 chart for 15 consecutive weeks as well as numbers six and nine on the Adult Contemporary and Rhythmic charts, respectively. It was ultimately placed at number one on the Hot 100 Airplay year-end chart of 1997.\nInternationally, \"Don't Speak\" was also very successful. In February 1997, it peaked at number one in both the United Kingdom and Ireland for three weeks. Elsewhere in Europe,"

Poor Georgie is the second single from hip-hop artist MC Lyte's third album Act Like You Know (1991). The song was produced by Ivan 'Doc' Rodriguez, and released on December 12, 1991. The song seeks to convey an anti-addiction message, through the story of George and the dysfunctional relationship MC Lyte has with this individual with self-destructive behaviors.\nPoor Georgie become Lyte's first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No.\u00a083 in March 1992. The song also peaked at No.\u00a011 on the Billboard's Hot R&B Singles and became her second song at No.\u00a01 on the Hot Rap Singles chart.\nDuring an interview with Vibe in 2011 Lyte stated on the composition of the song:\n\u201c\u2018Poor Georgie\u2019 was straight up storytelling. I just put every possible bad thing that could happen to someone in one song [laughs]. That was in itself humorous. With that song, I just wanted to paint a picture and have it hit people on all fronts. So if you don\u2019t drink, well what about if you smoke? You don\u2019t smoke, what about if you drink? This is what you stand to face if you do harmful things to your body.\u201d\nDuring another interview in 2013 she says:\n\u201cSo there are times with songs like \u201cPoor Georgie\u201d that when I heard it, it made me feel like oh my god this is a story about a man who has some deep problems and deep issues(...) To a large degree I knew I needed to talk about drugs and the effect it had on people. In Brooklyn there were weed smokers, dope dealers and people dying. In Harlem, where I would spend my weekends, there was heroin and you\u2019d see people nodding out in the middle of the damn street. You would see people with holes in their arms or their legs because they couldn\u2019t find anymore veins to put something into. In Queens there was crack and in Harlem as well. I just knew my mission would be to try to educate my generation about the usage of drugs, selling it or being the drug dealer\u2019s girlfriend and you wind up shot or in jail because of it. So I did make a conscious effort of that at a very young age.\u201d\nThe song was produced by Ivan 'Doc' Rodr\u00edguez, who had previously worked remixed other songs by MC Lyte, including Cappucino.\nThe music video for \"Poor Georgie\" was released in September 1991 and features an appearance by 16-year-old Lauryn Hill.\nThe song contains multi-element samples from Toto's \"Georgy Porgy\", vocals from The Supremes' \"My World Is Empty Without You\", Michael Jackson's \"I Wanna Be Where You Are\", Jimmy Spicer's \"The Bubble Bunch\" hook. The song also samples the drums from Eric B. & Rakim's \"Eric B. Is President\". Additionally, MC Lyte interpolates \"Just Be Good to Me\" from the The S.O.S. Band, from the second verse (\"I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me!\").\n\"Poor Georgie\" was included the compilation albums The Very Best of MC Lyte (2001), The Shit I Never Dropped (2003), Rhyme Masters (2005), Rhino Hi-Five: MC Lyte (2007), and Cold Rock a Party - Best Of MC Lyte (2019).\nIn February 1992, Lyte performed the song on the dance and music show Soul Train.

Produced by Wolf & Epic, it was released on April 9, 1992.\nIn the song Lyte talks about social issues such as AIDS, crack and teenage pregnancy.\nIn May 1992 \"Eyes Are the Soul\" peaked No.\u00a084 on the Billboard's Hot R&B Singles.\nIn each verse of the song, Lyte describes a different afflicted person. The first person in the narrative is a male with HIV\u2013AIDS, the second person is a crack addict wanted by the law, and the third is a young, black, pregnant teenager who is considering abortion.\nShortly after the single was released, speaking at a Baltimore school, she confessed that \"Sometimes I get discouraged when I do songs like this and they don't get as popular as (others). I'm just trying to get the message out.\"\nDuring an interview with Ebony in 2012, Lyte commented on the song's AIDS prevention message:\n\"I can't even tell you that I had lost someone or that I knew of anyone who had lost someone(...) I just knew this disease was on its way to causing devastation in the world, but specifically in our communities, and that knowledge just scared the mess out of me.\"\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" was included on her compilation albums The Very Best of MC Lyte (2001), Rhyme Masters (2005), and Cold Rock a Party \u2013 Best of MC Lyte (2019) The music video was included on the compilation video album Lyte Years (1991).\nConnie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times highlighted the song in her album review, saying \"AIDS, crack addiction and teen pregnancy are topics treated with nonjudgmental empathy.\" James Bernard of Entertainment Weekly called the song \"my own favorite\", commenting \"Lyte slips into a storytelling mode to convey the anguish of her peers who are grappling with AIDS, drug addiction, and the specter of the abortion clinic. Rather than tossing around empty rhetoric, Lyte takes us face-to-face with these people, forcing us to look into their eyes.\"\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic's Alex Henderson also highlighted the song, describing it as \"a poignant reflection on the destruction caused by crack cocaine\". In a 2010 review, Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters commented on the song \"In \u201cEyes Are the Soul\u201d, MC Lyte turns the eyes into symbols of our collective humanity. There's a frailty in this symbolism, one that is echoed by the swelling synth backdrop and busy but light percussion.\" further highlighting its similarities to the TLC hit song \"Waterfalls\".\nIn the book Stare in the Darkness: The Limits of Hip-hop and Black Politics (2011), political scientist Lester Spence commented on the song:\n\"MC Lyte firmly places the responsibility for their condition on their own shoulders. The HIV\u2013AIDS victim contracted the disease because he was irresponsible and did not know the woman with whom he was both sleeping and sharing needles. The crack addict is addicted because his mother was an addict. The final instance?\n'I've watched her grow, little girl down the street\nWhite shirts and skirts with pleats/She cried, fear in her voice/Not knowing, she had a choice'\n\nIn each case, Lyte evinces sympathy and warmth toward the victim. By depicting the girl as she was when she was a child, Lyte depicts her as a young innocent and, in so doing, evokes sympathy from the listener. However, even in her sympathy, she frames the issue as one of individual knowledge. If the girl knew more, just as if the HIV\u2013AIDS victim had better control, she wouldn't be in the situation she's in. There is no consideration of larger structural forces that shape access to material resources or even of the knowledge that Lyte suggests is the solution.\"\n\n\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Soul Remix) (4:10)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Jazzy Soul Remix) (5:24)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (LP Version) (3:53)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Soul Remix Instrumental) (4:10)\n\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Soul Remix) (4:10)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Jazzy Soul Remix) (5:24)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (LP Version) (3:53)\n\"Eyes Are the Soul\" (Soul Remix Instrumental) (4:10)\nCredits are taken from the liner notes.\nLyrics By \u2013 MC Lyte\nMixed By \u2013 Carman Rizzo\nMusic By \u2013 Bret Mazur, Richard Wolf\nProducer \u2013 Wolf & Epic\n\"MC Lyte - Eyes Are the Soul (12 inch Vinyl Single - Atlantic #96188)\".

And then one night on a trip back from Boston after doing in-stores and performing, we had the radio on WBLS and heard Mr. Magic and Marley Marl playing [Antoinette\u2019s] \u2018I Got An Attitude.\u2019 It was the same [Audio Two] track, but it was organized a different way.\u201d\nAccording to Lyte, they told her to write a diss track to Antoinette, as doing so would make them look like \"the wackest men on the face of the planet.\" The song, recorded at the I.N.S. Studios in New York City, became a single from her debut album Lyte as a Rock.\n\u201cIt was pretty easy\u2014we just sat there and thought of the worst things we could possibly say about somebody,\u201d Lyte recalled in 2007 in Brian Coleman's book Check The Technique. \u201cIt's titled that because that's only ten percent of what I could have said. I didn't even know Antoinette. It was strictly a war on wax.\u201d\nThe song contains samples of Roxanne Shante's \"Roxanne's Revenge\" in your intro  and drum break in the background comes from The Honey Drippers's Impeach the President, James Brown's Super Bad and Audio Two's Top Billin'.\n\"10% Dis\" was included in his compilation albums The Very Best of MC Lyte (2001), The Shit I Never Dropped (2003), and  Cold Rock a Party - Best Of MC Lyte (2019).\nMC Lyte herself has sampled the song on her other Diss Track to Antoinette \"Shut the Eff Up! (Hoe)\" and in his collaboration with Billy Lawrence on \"Come On\". It has also been sampled/referenced by several other artists:\nIn 1991, was interpolated in A Tribe Called Quest's song \"The Infamous Date Rape\" from the album The Low End Theory. In the third verse, Q-Tip sings \"Baby, baby, baby I don't wanna be rude/But I know because of your bloody attitude\" in reference to the line of the song in which it says \"30 days a month your mood is rude/We know the cause of your bloody attitude\".\nIn June 1996, 10% Dis was interpolated in Tupac Shakur and Outlawz's diss song Hit 'Em Up, which insults to several East Coast rappers, chief among them, Biggie Smalls. In the fifth verse, E.D.I. Mean sings the chorus \"Beat biter, dope style taker/Tell you to your face you ain't nothing but a faker\" changing it to \"You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker/I'll tell you to your face, you ain't shit but a faker\". Also Tupac Shakur has a sample of the song in \"Crooked Nigga Too\".\nIn November 1996 it was sampled by Ras Kass on the song \"On Earth as It Is...\" from his debut album Soul on Ice.\nIn 1997, was interpolated in Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's song \"U Ain't Bone\" from the album The Art of War. At the beginning of the second verse, Layzie Bone sings the chorus \"Beat biter, dope style taker/Tell you to your face you ain't nothing but a faker\" changing it to \"They beat biters, dope-style takers/When I see you face-to-face/My nigga, I'm a treat you like a hater\".\nSnoop Dogg interpolates 10% Dis in his collaboration with N.W.A in Chin Check (1999). In the fourth verse he refers to the song saying \"God damn hoes, here we go again\"\nIn 1999, is interpolated on Mobb Deep's remix of Quiet Storm with Lil Kim, who used her guest verse to diss rapper Foxy Brown. She would reply in his collaboration with Capone-N-Noreaga in \"Bang, Bang\" (2000), which would also have an interpolation to 10% Dis. In the third verse he quotes the intro of the song singing \"Hot damn ho, here we go again/Pop shit like a cock, +Lyte+ weight as your +Rocks+, bitch.\"\nAnother diss track by Foxy Brown, this time against Queen"

Poor Georgie is the second single from hip-hop artist MC Lyte's third album Act Like You Know (1991). The song was produced by Ivan 'Doc' Rodriguez, and released on December 12, 1991. The song seeks to convey an anti-addiction message, through the story of George and the dysfunctional relationship MC Lyte has with this individual with self-destructive behaviors.\nPoor Georgie become Lyte's first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No.\u00a083 in March 1992. The song also peaked at No.\u00a011 on the Billboard's Hot R&B Singles and became her second song at No.\u00a01 on the Hot Rap Singles chart.\nDuring an interview with Vibe in 2011 Lyte stated on the composition of the song:\n\u201c\u2018Poor Georgie\u2019 was straight up storytelling. I just put every possible bad thing that could happen to someone in one song [laughs]. That was in itself humorous. With that song, I just wanted to paint a picture and have it hit people on all fronts. So if you don\u2019t drink, well what about if you smoke? You don\u2019t smoke, what about if you drink? This is what you stand to face if you do harmful things to your body.\u201d\nDuring another interview in 2013 she says:\n\u201cSo there are times with songs like \u201cPoor Georgie\u201d that when I heard it, it made me feel like oh my god this is a story about a man who has some deep problems and deep issues(...) To a large degree I knew I needed to talk about drugs and the effect it had on people. In Brooklyn there were weed smokers, dope dealers and people dying. In Harlem, where I would spend my weekends, there was heroin and you\u2019d see people nodding out in the middle of the damn street. You would see people with holes in their arms or their legs because they couldn\u2019t find anymore veins to put something into. In Queens there was crack and in Harlem as well. I just knew my mission would be to try to educate my generation about the usage of drugs, selling it or being the drug dealer\u2019s girlfriend and you wind up shot or in jail because of it. So I did make a conscious effort of that at a very young age.\u201d\nThe song was produced by Ivan 'Doc' Rodr\u00edguez, who had previously worked remixed other songs by MC Lyte, including Cappucino.\nThe music video for \"Poor Georgie\" was released in September 1991 and features an appearance by 16-year-old Lauryn Hill.\nThe song contains multi-element samples from Toto's \"Georgy Porgy\", vocals from The Supremes' \"My World Is Empty Without You\", Michael Jackson's \"I Wanna Be Where You Are\", Jimmy Spicer's \"The Bubble Bunch\" hook. The song also samples the drums from Eric B. & Rakim's \"Eric B. Is President\". Additionally, MC Lyte interpolates \"Just Be Good to Me\" from the The S.O.S. Band, from the second verse (\"I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me!\").\n\"Poor Georgie\" was included the compilation albums The Very Best of MC Lyte (2001), The Shit I Never Dropped (2003), Rhyme Masters (2005), Rhino Hi-Five: MC Lyte (2007), and Cold Rock a Party - Best Of MC Lyte (2019).\nIn February 1992, Lyte performed the song on the dance and music show Soul Train.

Co-written with and produced by Sam Watters and Louis Biancaniello, the song was released as the album's second single. It was also the only single released in the United States from the album, peaking at number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.\n\"One Day In Your Life\" was written by Anastacia and co-written with and produced by Sam Watters and Louis Biancaniello. It is a  soulful disco song. It also features a funk synthesizer.\nJose F. Promis written for Allmusic called it \"dramatic\" and said that \"it follows the same formula as her previous hit, 'I'm Outta Love,' but better, with more soaring, epic vocals, and sounds like a rock version of a forgotten disco classic.\" Mark Bautz from Entertainment Weekly commented that \"it has a kicky Flashdance retro vibe.\" Aidin Vaziri from Rolling Stone called it \"a moment of sheer overkill.\"\nThough \"One Day in Your Life\" never charted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, it earned Anastacia her first chart-topper on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart, staying atop for one week. The single fared far better elsewhere, charting within the top ten in Australia and several European countries, including Austria, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, while peaking at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart.\nAnastacia performed \"One Day in Your Life\" at several live events such as the Edison Awards on February 27, 2002 (where she won the award for Best International Female), VH1's Divas Las Vegas on May 23, 2002, the Royal Variety Performance on December 2, 2002, and the Life Ball on May 20, 2006, as well as on television shows like Live with Regis and Kelly in the United States, Top of the Pops in the United Kingdom, Wetten, dass..? in Germany, and Rove Live in Australia. In addition, she performed the song on her 2004\u201305 Live at Last Tour (although it was not included on the Live at Last DVD) and on her 2009 Heavy Rotation Tour.\nBeing her first music video directed by Dave Meyers, who has also directed videos for Janet Jackson, Britney Spears, Pink, and Bow Wow, the video was shot on January 16\u201317, 2002 in Los Angeles and Santa Monica, California. In the beginning, while the sun is rising up, Anastacia is shown eating a bowl of cereal for breakfast, while singing the first verse of the song. After the slow opening, she dances through the room and you see other people in a sort of a game house. The video shows men playing volleyball on the beach and other people swimming in the pool. Then Anastacia is seen lying on a pool side with braids wearing a bikini. When the second chorus breaks, an old man sprinkles her wet using his hose. Next, the camera travels through a sand castle. When it gets out of the castle, Anastacia is seen dancing while behind her people are skateboarding on a ramp. An alternate version of the video also exists, which was released in the United States. This version of the video mainly contains footage from the regular video featuring some new scenes, from the same video shoot.

Cha Cha Cha is the lead single from MC Lyte's second album Eyes on This. Produced by King Of Chill, who also has songwriting credits, it was released on September 8, 1989.\nThe song stayed 18 weeks on the recently created Billboard Hot Rap Singles and became one of the first songs to peak at No.\u00a01 on that chart, staying there for two weeks in December 1989. Although MC Lyte had already reached #1 on Rap chart a few months earlier with the collaborative single \"Self Destruction\", this was the first time that a woman had achieved it as the lead artist. In turn, it would also become Lyte's first appearance on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop (then called \"Billboard Hot Black Singles\"), peaking No.\u00a035.\nIn 2008 \"Cha Cha Cha\" was No.\u00a054 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop list and Lil' Kim performed a rewritten version on her mixtape, Ms. G.O.A.T.\nAlthough the song's credits only feature King of Chill as the songwriter, MC Lyte stated that they wrote the song together:\n\u201cThere were occasions like a song like \u2018Cha Cha Cha\u2019 King of Chill wrote that with me. I didn\u2019t have a problem with opening the door to someone writing with me at times. But I had to have my stamp in it, on it and all round it because I\u2019m not just saying whatever someone writes.\u201d\nAlso comment about the lyrics:\n\u201cThere were some things that were humorous in there that I didn\u2019t write or didn\u2019t like or thought was the hottest line I ever said. It was comical to me\u2026like that line, \u2018Well, well, well, I\u2019ll be damned.\u2019 But turned out that that\u2019s one of the most memorable parts of \u2018Cha Cha Cha.\u2019 Whenever I perform it that\u2019s the part that the whole crowd wants to say. So sometimes you have to get out of yourself and let a new way of approaching a rhyme happen.\u201d\nThe song contains samples of Four Tops's \"I Can't Live Without You\" bass part, Kraftwerk's \"The Man-Machine\" lead synth part, Funkadelic's \"Good Old Music\"'s drum, Cerrone's \"Rocket in the Pocket\"'s drum, and The Fearless Four's \"Rockin' It\" hook. The song also has a vocal interpolation of herself on \"Kickin' 4 Brooklyn\" from her debut album.\nThe music video for the song, directed by Tamra Davis, was filmed in August 1989 on Randall's Island, New York City. In the video, shot almost entirely in black and white, Lyte is shown alongside her bodyguard, her DJ K-Rock, and her dancers Leg One and Leg Two.\nIt was included on her compilation video album Lyte Years (1991).\n\"Cha Cha Cha\" was included in his compilation albums The Very Best of MC Lyte (2001), The Shit I Never Dropped (2003), Rhyme Masters (2005), Rhino Hi-Five: MC Lyte (2007), Cold Rock a Party - Best Of MC Lyte (2019)  and on the EastWest Maxi-Single \"Lyte Of A Decade\" (1996).\nIn the fall of 1991 she performed the song at the Pay-per-view TV concert   Sisters In The Name of Rap.\nThe song was performed by Da Brat and Remy Ma at the MC Lyte tribute at the 2006 VH1 Hip Hop Honors.\nThe song was also featured on the soundtrack of the video game Grand Theft Auto IV on the fictional in-game station \"The Classics 104.1\".\nIn October 2008 she performed \"Cha Cha Cha\" at the BET Hip Hop Awards.\nIn October 14, 2014, MC Lyte performed this song to President Barack Obama in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the legislation that created the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts.\nIn 1999, Ego Trip's editors ranked Cha Cha Cha No.\u00a027 in their list Hip Hop's 40 Greatest Singles by Year 1989 in Ego Trip's Book of Rap Lists.\nIn 2008, it was No.\u00a054 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.\n\nIn 2009, PopMatters's Quentin B. Huff reviewed the song in his note \"I still love H.E.R. (and so should everyone else)\", commenting: \n\"(MC Lyte) tenor of voice and the precision of her delivery make her undeniable, not to mention her willingness to try a variety of subject matter. Despite the variety, however, she is well suited to battle mode where she can verbally stomp her competition. \"Cha Cha Cha\" is that type of song, but the execution is so smooth, with one of the slinkiest bass lines in all of rap, that she accomplishes her mission without being menacing. At the same time, she naturally sounds a bit like a mobster from an old black-and-white movie. I can easily see her pulling a Humphrey Bogart and saying something like, \"Move kid, ya botha me. Am-scray, will ya?\" \"Cha Cha Cha\" is more subdued and matter of fact than \"I'm Bad\", LL Cool J's earnest tribute to his lyrical skill.\"\nJack White revealed the song as the primary inspiration behind his 2014 Grammy\u2013nominated"

The song was written by Benny Andersson, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson, with Anni-Frid Lyngstad singing the lead vocals. During recording sessions, it had the working titles of \"Ring It In\" and \"Number 1, Number 1\". The song was released in February 1977 as the album's fourth and final single from the group's album Arrival.\n\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" was recorded in 1976 at the Metronome studio in Stockholm and was released as a single in February 1977, becoming one of the group's more successful hits. The B-side was \"Happy Hawaii\", an arrangement of another ABBA song, \"Why Did It Have to Be Me?\", but with a different lead vocalist and lyrics. \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" was one of the early ABBA songs to deal with the break-up of a relationship. It predates the divorces of the ABBA members as well as further break-up songs to come: \"The Winner Takes It All\", \"One of Us\" and \"When All Is Said and Done\". Group member Benny Andersson named \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" as one of ABBA's best recordings in a 2004 interview, along with \"Dancing Queen\", \"The Winner Takes It All\" and \"When I Kissed the Teacher\". \"Conoci\u00e9ndome, Conoci\u00e9ndote\" is the Spanish-language version of the song. It was included in the compilation Oro: Grandes \u00c9xitos released in 1993 and Gracias Por La M\u00fasica released in 1980.\nThe music video depicts the band against various colored backdrops singing while facing each other, turning away as a new line is sung. At the end of the video, the band's female members are seen walking away through thick snow. The video was directed by future Academy Award nominee Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and is a landmark in his career alongside most other videos of the band which were directed by him.\n\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" proved to be one of ABBA's more successful singles, hitting #1 in West Germany (ABBA's sixth consecutive chart-topper there) and the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico and South Africa, and reaching the top 3 in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. It was a top 10 hit in Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand and Norway. In the United States, it became ABBA's sixth top 20 single, peaking at #14 on the Hot 100 and reaching #7 on Billboard's AC chart.\nIn the UK, \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" was one of the biggest singles of 1977. It also began a second run of three consecutive #1 singles for ABBA (followed by \"The Name of the Game\" and \"Take a Chance on Me\"), the group having had three consecutive #1 hit singles in 1976. As of September 2021, it is the group's third-biggest song in the country with 1.02 million chart sales, made up of pure sales and streams.\nBy September 1979 in West Germany \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" had sold over 300,000 copies.\nBillboard reviewed the song and described it as a \"melodically energetic but sad worded ditty about a romantic breakup.\"\n\nAnni-Frid Lyngstad \u2013 lead vocals\nAgnetha F\u00e4ltskog - backing vocals\nBj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nBenny Andersson \u2013 keyboards, synthesizer\nRutger Gunnarsson - bass, string arrangements\n\n\n\n\nA cover recorded in 1977 by the Top of the Poppers appears on the 2002 compilation album Knowing Me, Knowing You.\nThe Paraguayan singer Perla recorded a Spanish version, Conociendonos Mas for the 1977 album Relaciones Internacionales.\nCzech singer V\u011bra \u0160pinarov\u00e1 recorded a Czech version, Slune\u010dn\u00e9 pob\u0159e\u017e\u00ed (meaning Sunny Beach in Bulgaria), in 1977.\nThe French conductor Franck Pourcel recorded an instrumental version for his 1978 album Pourcel meets Abba.\nBritish singer Cilla Black recorded a cover for her 1980 album Especially for You.\nSwedish pop group A-Teens included the song as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of their debut album The ABBA Generation.\nDanny Wilson recorded a live version of the song, which was released on their bonus album Three-In-A-Bed Romp in 1991.

Written by the group members, together with Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard during the group's first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album Spice (1996).\n\"2 Become 1\" is a pop ballad that features instrumentation from a guitar, an electronic keyboard and string instruments. The lyrics focus on the bonding of two lovers, and also address the importance of contraception. Its Big TV!-directed music video, which features the group performing against time-lapse footage of Times Square in New York City, was completely shot against a green screen at a studio in London. The backdrop was later superimposed.\nReleased as the group's third single on 16 December 1996, it was generally well received by music critics and was a commercial success. It topped the UK Singles Chart for three weeks, becoming the group's third consecutive chart-topper, their second million-selling single, and their first Christmas number-one single in the United Kingdom. In July 1997, the song was released in the United States, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100, and receiving a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It performed similarly internationally, peaking inside the top ten on the majority of the charts that it entered. The song was named \"Song of the Year\" at the 1998 ASCAP London Music Awards.\nIn 2019, Emma Bunton covered the song, as a duet, with Robbie Williams on her fourth solo album, My Happy Place.\nIn December 1994, the Spice Girls persuaded their former managers\u2014father-and-son team Bob and Chris Herbert\u2014to set up a showcase in front of industry writers, producers and A&R men at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush, London. Producer Richard Stannard was originally at the studio to meet pop star Jason Donovan, but he ended up in the showcase after hearing Melanie Brown, as she went charging across the corridor. Stannard recalls:\nMore than anything, they just made me laugh. I couldn't believe I'd walked into this situation. You didn't care if they were in time with the dance steps or whether one was overweight or one wasn't as good as the others. It was something more. It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.\nStannard stayed after everyone had left the showcase to talk to the group, he then reported back to his songwriter partner Matt Rowe, that he had found the pop group of their dreams. In January 1995, Chris Herbert booked the group's first professional songwriting session with the producers at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, East London. Rowe remember feeling similarly to Stannard when he first met the group, \"I love them. Immediately. [...] They were like no one I'd met before, really.\" The session was productive as the duo seemed to get along with the group, together they discussed about the songwriting process and what they wanted to do with the record. In her autobiography, Brown recalled that the duo instinctively understood their point of view and knew how to incorporate \"the spirit of five loud girls into great pop music\".\n\"2 Become 1\" was co-written by the Spice Girls along with partners Richard Stannard and Matthew Rowe. Stannard and Rowe also co-produced the track. After writing more uptempo dance-based songs, such as \"Wannabe\", the group and the two producers decided to write a slow ballad. But as the group were writing the song, they realised that it was a bit too slushy, so it was decided to address the importance of contraception with the lyrics: \"Be a little bit wiser baby. Put it on, put it on\".\nThe song was inspired by the \"special relationship\" that was developing between Geri Halliwell and Rowe. Brown hinted at this development in her autobiography commenting: \"When he [Rowe] and Geri started making eyes at each other I knew what was going on, even though they denied it. I knew them both too well for it to be a secret for me.\" Stannard commented about the fondness between Halliwell and Rowe: \"I don't want to get into the side of things. They were very close. They clicked. And I think the lyrics in '2 Become 1' came from that, especially the first verse, which they wrote together.\"\nThe group recorded a European Spanish version of the song, written by them, Rowe, Stannard, and N. Ma\u00f1o. The title was \"2 Become 1\" (Spanish Version),"

Written by the group members, together with Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard during the group's first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album Spice (1996).\n\"2 Become 1\" is a pop ballad that features instrumentation from a guitar, an electronic keyboard and string instruments. The lyrics focus on the bonding of two lovers, and also address the importance of contraception. Its Big TV!-directed music video, which features the group performing against time-lapse footage of Times Square in New York City, was completely shot against a green screen at a studio in London. The backdrop was later superimposed.\nReleased as the group's third single on 16 December 1996, it was generally well received by music critics and was a commercial success. It topped the UK Singles Chart for three weeks, becoming the group's third consecutive chart-topper, their second million-selling single, and their first Christmas number-one single in the United Kingdom. In July 1997, the song was released in the United States, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100, and receiving a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It performed similarly internationally, peaking inside the top ten on the majority of the charts that it entered. The song was named \"Song of the Year\" at the 1998 ASCAP London Music Awards.\nIn 2019, Emma Bunton covered the song, as a duet, with Robbie Williams on her fourth solo album, My Happy Place.\nIn December 1994, the Spice Girls persuaded their former managers\u2014father-and-son team Bob and Chris Herbert\u2014to set up a showcase in front of industry writers, producers and A&R men at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush, London. Producer Richard Stannard was originally at the studio to meet pop star Jason Donovan, but he ended up in the showcase after hearing Melanie Brown, as she went charging across the corridor. Stannard recalls:\nMore than anything, they just made me laugh. I couldn't believe I'd walked into this situation. You didn't care if they were in time with the dance steps or whether one was overweight or one wasn't as good as the others. It was something more. It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.\nStannard stayed after everyone had left the showcase to talk to the group, he then reported back to his songwriter partner Matt Rowe, that he had found the pop group of their dreams. In January 1995, Chris Herbert booked the group's first professional songwriting session with the producers at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, East London. Rowe remember feeling similarly to Stannard when he first met the group, \"I love them. Immediately. [...] They were like no one I'd met before, really.\" The session was productive as the duo seemed to get along with the group, together they discussed about the songwriting process and what they wanted to do with the record. In her autobiography, Brown recalled that the duo instinctively understood their point of view and knew how to incorporate \"the spirit of five loud girls into great pop music\".\n\"2 Become 1\" was co-written by the Spice Girls along with partners Richard Stannard and Matthew Rowe. Stannard and Rowe also co-produced the track. After writing more uptempo dance-based songs, such as \"Wannabe\", the group and the two producers decided to write a slow ballad. But as the group were writing the song, they realised that it was a bit too slushy, so it was decided to address the importance of contraception with the lyrics: \"Be a little bit wiser baby. Put it on, put it on\".\nThe song was inspired by the \"special relationship\" that was developing between Geri Halliwell and Rowe. Brown hinted at this development in her autobiography commenting: \"When he [Rowe] and Geri started making eyes at each other I knew what was going on, even though they denied it. I knew them both too well for it to be a secret for me.\" Stannard commented about the fondness between Halliwell and Rowe: \"I don't want to get into the side of things. They were very close. They clicked. And I think the lyrics in '2 Become 1' came from that, especially the first verse, which they wrote together.\"\nThe group recorded a European Spanish version of the song, written by them, Rowe, Stannard, and N. Ma\u00f1o. The title was \"2 Become 1\" (Spanish Version),"

It was written by the group, Richard Stannard, and Matt Rowe, while it was produced by the latter two. The song became the girls' first song without the vocals of Geri Halliwell. It was released by Virgin Records on 14 December 1998 and was later included on their third studio album Forever (2000). \"Goodbye\" is a pop ballad that lyrically consists of the group's farewell to a friend, specifically Halliwell. The lyrics were also seen, by the media and fans alike, as the group's end, although the idea was dismissed by the girls.\n\"Goodbye\" received positive reviews from music commentators, who said it was one of the group's best singles. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the UK Singles Chart and making the Spice Girls the first act to have had three consecutive Christmas number-one singles since The Beatles in 1965. Across the world, it was also commercially successful, reaching the top spots in Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland and peaking inside the top five on the charts in Australia, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Taiwan. Additionally, \"Goodbye\" peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100.\nThe accompanying music video for \"Goodbye\" was filmed at Mentmore Towers and featured the group singing the song at a castle, including Melanie Brown and Victoria Beckham, who were both pregnant at the time. To promote \"Goodbye\", the Spice Girls performed the song on several television shows, such as the Royal Variety Performance and Top of the Pops, and was later included on the group's concert tours Christmas in Spiceworld (1999), The Return of the Spice Girls (2007\u201308) and Spice World - 2019 Tour (2019).\nOn 31 May 1998, member Geri Halliwell announced her departure from the Spice Girls. Through her solicitor, she stated, \"Sadly I would like to confirm that I have left the Spice Girls. This is because of differences between us. I'm sure the group will continue to be successful and I wish them all the best.\" Halliwell claimed that she was suffering from exhaustion and wanted to take a break. Her departure from the group made news headlines around the world and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the year. The four remaining members were adamant that the group would carry on.\nIn July 1998, during the American leg of their Spiceworld Tour, the group decided to rework \"Goodbye\", which had been written when Halliwell was still part of the group. For this, songwriters and music producers Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe flew to Nashville, Tennessee to meet the group. Recording footage was shown in the Channel 4 documentary Spice Girls In America: A Tour Story. In an interview the following September, Mel B denied the song meant the group's split, saying:\n\"That was the first time I've cried listening to one of our songs, the first time I instantly cried. It's got a full orchestra on there and it just sounds fantastic. [The song] is really obviously about what's happened during the year, with Geri leaving and then being strong. [...] The song is called 'Goodbye', but it's not goodbye-goodbye, cause the chorus actually is 'goodbye my friend, it's not the end'. So for all those people thinks we're breaking up, we're not. So correct that\".\nIn the Spice Girls' 1999 autobiography, Forever Spice, group member Melanie C said, \"'Goodbye' was originally about a relationship ending, but now it's about Geri and it's really sad\". Stannard elaborated, saying, \"It was about moving on and saying goodbye to the old Spice Girls. It wasn't Goodbye to Geri; it wasn't really literal. A lot of that song was written when they were touring in America. We wrote it in Nashville so I think it has that sentimental feel to it because everyone was kind of homesick and knackered\". Halliwell later declared that she found \"very flattering that they dedicated it to me.\"\n\"Goodbye\" was first released on 14 December 1998 in the United Kingdom as a CD and cassette single. In the United States, the single was released as part of an extended play album (EP) and contained a cover of The Waitresses' 1981 single \"Christmas Wrapping\", as well as live versions of \"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\" and \"We Are Family\" that were recorded at Wembley Stadium on 20 September 1998. \"Christmas Wrapping\" only featured vocals from Melanie Chisholm and Emma Bunton due to the pregnancies of Melanie Brown and Victoria Beckham.

It was released on January 23, 2012, by Hollywood Records, as the second and final single from the album. The song was written and produced by Josh Alexander and Billy Steinberg. \"Give Your Heart a Break\" incorporates drums, violin and strings. The latter two, according to music critics, are reminiscent of those used in Coldplay's \"Viva la Vida\". Lyrically, the song chronicles the protagonist's attempt to win over their lover who has been hurt in a previous relationship and is fearful of committing again.\n\"Give Your Heart a Break\" received acclaim from music critics, who mostly praised the production and Lovato's vocals. The single debuted at number 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number 16 on the chart, as well as reaching number one on the Billboard Pop Songs chart. The song has debuted at number 33 in New Zealand and has peaked at number nine, marking the first time Lovato had two top 10 singles from one album in the country.\nOriginally, it was announced the second single from the album \"Who's That Boy\" (featuring Dev), but later was scrapped due to Dev's pregnancy. \"Give Your Heart a Break\" was written and produced by Josh Alexander and Billy Steinberg, who are known for their work on The Veronicas' sophomore studio album, Hook Me Up, as well as JoJo's \"Too Little Too Late\". Alexander is credited with having a bigger hand in the song's production, handling all the instruments while programming, recording and engineering the song. Chris Garcia shared engineering credits with Alexander while Scott Roewe is credited with providing Logic and Pro Tools technology. According to MTV, Lovato explained that despite the play on the word \"heartbreak\" in the title, the song is about the exact opposite. \"Last year I began working on a song about a different kind of love,\" they said. \"It's a song about showing someone you love that you're the one right in front of them. This is a song about faith.\"\n\"Give Your Heart a Break\" is three minutes and twenty-five seconds long. The song uses the instruments such as the suspenseful strings that sounds similar to that used in Coldplay's \"Viva la Vida\".  According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc., \"Give Your Heart a Break\" is written in the key of G\u266d major. It is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 123 beats per minute. The song follows the chord progression of C\u266d2\u2013G\u266d\u2013A\u266dm7 (add 4)\u2013D\u266d. Lovato's vocal range spans over two octaves, from the low note of E\u266d\u2083 to the high note of G\u266d\u2085.\n\"Give Your Heart a Break\" received acclaim from music critics. Joe DeAndrea of AbsolutePunk praised the song along with \"Mistake\" as ballads going \"far and beyond anything in Lovato's prior arsenal. It sets a mark as to what should be expected from similar artists such as [them], but in the process, distancing [themself] from being grouped with them becoming a solo entity.\" Jason Scott of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer noted that the song, along with \"Mistake\" and \"Hold Up\", feature \"electrically forceful instrumentation\". Jocelyn Vena of MTV complimented it as a smart dance song, along with \"Hold Up\".\nIn another extensive review, Laurence Green from musicOMH praised the track, calling it an \"exceptionally brilliant track,\" while commenting that they \"become the true pop heroine; backed up by infinitely bigger, better choruses.\" Sam Lansky, a writer and editor for MTV's Buzzworthy Blog, lauded the recording for presenting Lovato's vocals as a masterpiece and praised the production as \"superb\".\n\"Give Your Heart a Break\" peaked at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100, marking Lovato's seventh highest peaking single in the nation. The song topped the US Pop Songs chart, becoming Lovato's first number one there, while reaching number 12 on the US Adult Top 40 chart, number 16 on the US Adult Contemporary chart, and at number 21 on the US Digital Songs chart. With 25 weeks, \"Give Your Heart a Break\" previously shared the record of longest ascendance to the summit of the Mainstream Top 40 with Cee Lo Green's \"Fuck You\". In August 2021, Billboard revealed the song is Lovato's most-heard on US radio accumulating 2.9 billion all-format audience impressions.\nInternationally, \"Give Your Heart a Break\" performed moderately; on the Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) chart, the song peaked at number 32, their first appearance and highest"

The track reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart on release in October 2001. Singer Gruff Rhys has described the song as being about \"rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution\".\nCritical reaction to the track was generally positive with many reviewers comparing the song to the work of other groups such as Status Quo, ELO and The Beach Boys. A promotional music video was produced to accompany \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\"'s release as a single. Directed by Pedro Romhanyi the video features images of fictional television stations including \"SFA TV\", which shows the band playing along with the track. An alternative video, directed by Sean Hillen, was included on the DVD version of Rings Around the World on its release in July 2001. This video features the lyrics to the track scrolling slowly from the bottom of the screen upwards in front of an image of a globe. The DVD version of Rings Around the World also includes a Llwybr Llaethog remix of \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\".\nAccording to lead vocalist Gruff Rhys, \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is about \"all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around. If you could visualize all the things we don't see, Earth could look like some kind of fucked-up Saturn. And that's the idea I have in my head\u00a0\u2013 surrounded by communication lines and traffic and debris thrown out of spaceships.\" Rhys has claimed that the theory was initially his girlfriend's father's. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.\n\"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is 3 minutes 29 seconds long and is in the key of B major. The track begins with feedback which plays while drums and a guitar, playing a riff based around a B chord, fade in. The first verse begins on 25 seconds with Gruff Rhys singing the lines \"You expose the film in me, we're drawing rings around the world\" backed by harmony vocals on the title phrase. A short bridge plays, during which the guitar chords change from B, E and F\u266f to just E, F\u266f, E, F\u266f. Another verse, bridge and verse play before the last bridge which begins at 1 minute 23 seconds. The outro starts at 1 minute 32 seconds with Rhys singing \"Ring ring, ring ring, rings around the world\" over the chords B, D and F\u266f backed by harmony vocals. A guitar counter-melody begins at 2 minutes 2 seconds and excerpts from phone calls the band made to random people around the world, including calls to the United States embassies in Madagascar and Moscow, a record shop in Osaka and a record company in Australia, play as the track fades out.\nA Llwybr Llaethog remix of \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is included on the DVD version of Rings Around The World. The track is 3 minutes 33 seconds in length and begins with a reed organ playing a riff in the key of B major. The remix largely follows the arrangement of the original but, for the majority of its duration, dispenses with the instrumental backing, featuring just Gruff Rhys's main vocals, the band's backing vocals and excerpts from the random phonecalls the group made alongside occasional organ and cymbals. Towards the end of the track the original version's guitar, drums and bass appear briefly before the song ends with the same reed organ riff that appeared at the start.\nCritical reaction to \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" was generally positive with many journalists comparing the song to the work of other groups. Writing for the NME, Ted Kessler described the track as \"Status Quo for Generation X-ers with a Manhattan Portage full of millennial tension\" and went on to ask \"who said there was anything wrong with that?\" in his review of the song on its release as a single, despite his earlier review of Rings Around the World claiming that the album would benefit from the removal of the \"Status Quo-ish title track\". Q described the track as \"excellent\" while PopMatters claimed the song \"sounds so much like ELO that it blows away everything on last year's ELO reunion album\" and the Dallas Observer stated that \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" is a \"Beach"

In 1968, Bowie wrote English lyrics for the Claude Fran\u00e7ois French song \"Comme d'habitude\". After his lyrics were rejected, songwriter Paul Anka rewrote it into \"My Way\", which became famous by singer Frank Sinatra in 1969. Annoyed at the success of \"My Way\", Bowie used the song as a template and wrote \"Life on Mars?\" as a parody of Sinatra's recording. Like other songs Bowie wrote during this period, it was written primarily on piano. Recording for \"Life on Mars?\" took place on 6 August 1971, the final day of the Hunky Dory sessions. Co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, the backing band consisted of guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey; Ronson also composed the song's string arrangement. After failing to acquire pianist Dudley Moore, piano was played by Strawbs member Rick Wakeman.\nMusically, \"Life on Mars?\" is described as a \"soaring, cinematic ballad\". It is primarily glam rock, with elements of cabaret and art rock. The song has a complex structure, containing different chord changes throughout. The instruments act in tangent with one another and Bowie's vocal, steadily growing throughout its runtime. Lyrically, the song describes a girl who goes to the cinema to escape reality, using numerous surreal images. It thematically reflects optimism and the effects of Hollywood. Despite its title, the song has no connection to Mars itself; it is instead a reference to a then-recent media frenzy between the United States and Soviet Union.\nAt the height of Bowie's fame as Ziggy Stardust, RCA Records issued \"Life on Mars?\" as a single on 22 June 1973 in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for thirteen weeks. The single release was promoted by a promotional video shot by photographer Mick Rock, featuring a made-up Bowie in a turquoise suit performing the song against a white backdrop. Bowie performed the song during his concerts frequently throughout his career, performances of which have appeared on several live albums. The song also has appeared on numerous compilation albums and was remixed by Scott in 2003 and 2016, the latter being a 'stripped down' mix. The 2016 mix was accompanied by a remastered and reedited version of Rock's video.\n\"Life on Mars?\" is considered by biographers and reviewers as one of Bowie's finest songs, with many describing it as a masterpiece. Praise is also given to Bowie's vocal performance and growth as a songwriter. Several publications have also considered it one of the greatest songs of all time. The song was the namesake of the British television series Life on Mars and has featured in other films and television shows. Artists who have covered the song include singer Barbra Streisand and Nine Inch Nails members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The song charted worldwide following Bowie's death in 2016 and became a frequent tribute song for the artist; tributes by Nicholas Freestone and singer Lorde garnered widespread attention.\nIn early 1968, David Bowie's publisher, David Platz, was sharing a London office with another music publisher, Geoffrey Heath. One day, Heath brought in an acetate of the 1967 French song \"Comme d'habitude\", composed by Claude Fran\u00e7ois and Jacques Revaux, and sung by Fran\u00e7ois. Having a limited option for the song's British rights, Heath requested Platz for a songwriter to write English lyrics for the song. Platz suggested Bowie, who at that point had done other translations for him. Bowie's then-manager, Kenneth Pitt, believed that Bowie was a stronger lyricist than a composer and if he wrote \"to a strong melody composed by someone else,\" it would guarantee him a hit. Bowie's translation, titled \"Even a Fool Learns to Love\", took influence from his then-recent work as a mime and featured a reference to his 1967 track \"When I Live My Dream\". He later told Michael Parkinson in a 2002 interview that he \"wrote some really terrible lyrics [to it]\". Although he recorded an unreleased demo in February 1968, the French publishers of \"Comme d'habitude\" rejected him, primarily due to his obscurity. Soon after, songwriter Paul Anka bought the"

The song first appeared on the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album in 1973. \"Bennie and the Jets\" has been one of John's most popular songs and was performed during his appearance at Live Aid.\nThe track was a massive hit in the United States and Canada, released in 1974 as an A-side and spelt 'Bennie'. In most territories the track was released as the B-side to \"Candle in the Wind\", but spelt 'Benny'. Album artwork (back-cover track listing and centre-panel design) consistently lists the song as 'Bennie' while either 'Bennie' or 'Benny' appears on the vinyl album depending on territory. The track was released as an A-side in the UK in 1976, as \"Benny and the Jets\".\nIt is ranked number 371 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\nThe song tells of \"Bennie and the Jets\", a fictional band of whom the song's narrator is a fan. In interviews, Taupin has said that the song's lyrics are a satire on the music industry of the 1970s. The greed and glitz of the early 1970s music scene is portrayed by Taupin's words:\nWe'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around,\nyou're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound.\nTaupin also goes on to describe the flashy wardrobe of \"Bennie\", the leader of the band:\nShe's got electric boots, a mohair suit\nYou know I read it in a magazine Ohh...\nProduced by Gus Dudgeon, the song was recorded during the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road sessions in France at Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville's Strawberry Studios, where John and Taupin had recorded their previous two albums, Honky Ch\u00e2teau and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player.\nJohn rarely plays the studio version of the song, and often makes subtle or even drastic changes. Live, the piano solo in the middle of the song has been played in all sorts of variations, from very close to the original to wildly improvised and extended versions, such as the elaborate version during a Central Park concert in 1980 and another memorable take on it during the \"Elton and his band\" part of the show recorded for what would become Live in Australia in December 1986. (It can be seen on various Laserdisc releases of the show.) He has also been known to end the song in a wide range of styles, including classical, swing, boogie-woogie and even using the signature five-note phrase from John Williams' score for Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\nDespite sounding as though recorded live, the song was actually recorded in studio, with live sound effects added in later. Producer Gus Dudgeon explained:\nFor some weird reason, Elton happened to have hit the opening piano chord of the song exactly one bar before the song actually started. So I was doing the mix and this chord kept coming on which you normally wouldn't expect to hear. I turned to engineer [David Hentschel] and I said, \u2018What does that remind you of? \u2026 It's the sort of thing that people do on stage just before they're going to start a song.\u2019 Just to kind of get everybody, \u2018Okay, here we go, ready?\u2019 For some reason that chord being there made me think, \u2018Maybe we should fake-live this.\u2019\nHe mixed in sounds from a 1972 performance of John in Royal Festival Hall and a 1970 Jimi Hendrix concert at the Isle of Wight. He also included a series of whistles from a live concert in Vancouver, and added hand claps and various shouts.\nThe song was the closing track on side one of the album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and John was set against releasing it as a single, believing it would fail. CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, began heavy airplay of the song and it became the #1 song in the Detroit market. This attention caused other American and Canadian Top 40 stations to add it to their playlists as well. As a result, the song peaked at #1 on the US singles chart in 1974. In the US, it was certified Gold on 8 April 1974 and Platinum on 13 September 1995 by the RIAA, and had sold 2.8 million copies by August 1976.\n\"Bennie and the Jets\" was also John's first Top 40 hit on what at the time was called the Billboard Hot Soul Singles chart, where it peaked at #15, the highest position out of the three of his singles which reached that chart. The acceptance of \"Bennie\" on R&B radio helped land John, a huge soul music fan, a guest appearance on the 17 May 1975 edition of Soul Train, where he played \"Bennie and the Jets\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom\". In Canada, it held the #1 spot on the RPM national singles chart for two weeks (13\u201320 April), becoming his"

The song was inspired by 1980s music and is lyrically about moving on after a heartbreak. It was released on 27 March 2020 through RCA UK as the lead single off their sixth studio album, Confetti (2020). \"Break Up Song\" peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart and charted in several other countries. It has since received gold music certifications from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and from Pro-M\u00fasica Brasil (PMB).\nLittle Mix members Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall wrote \"Break Up Song\" with Frank Nobel, and producers Kamille and Goldfingers. According to Thirlwall, they wrote the song more than a year prior to its release with 1980s pop music and an element of nostalgia in mind, similar to that of their 2015 single \"Black Magic\". Edwards, Pinnock and Thirlwall composed it during a whirl of creativity where they wrote seven songs with Kamille in one day, after having only one melody from a frustrating previous session. The track's 1980s sound stemmed from a synthesiser they dabbled with in the studio.\nA different song was initially chosen as their sixth album's lead single with an accompanying music video already filmed. However, the group opted for \"Break Up Song\" at the last minute after hearing the demo again during a playback session. The demo had only one verse and main line. Edwards described it as \"very basic at the time. The beat was all over the place and it was really, really rough - but it just had something about it.\" Thirlwall recalled, \"We got that jittery feeling that we had with \"Shout Out to My Ex\" and \"Black Magic\" where it just felt special.\"\nThirlwall described the track as \"a very feel-good kind of empowerment song about going out and just forgetting about all your woes and troubles\". It was also called an \"80s-synth pop anthem\" about \"getting over the end of a relationship\".\nA Little Mix-themed filter on Instagram was made available to the group's followers to promote the track. The song was released on 27 March 2020 and on the same day a Spotify vertical video and a lyric video were both released. The latter was made by Kayleigh, a fan of the band from the Netherlands.\nLittle Mix announced the official music video for the song on 7 May 2020 on their social media, and it was released a day later at 9am BST. The music video for the song was semi-animated, as the planned video shoot for the song had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The group filmed portions of the video at home using the original concept. The animation of the video displayed felt fabric texture to depict the band. In the video, the animated part was focused on the group hosting a Good Morning Britain-style breakfast show on a television channel called LM TV. Leigh- Anne Pinnock is presented as a news reporter, while Jesy Nelson presents the weather forecast.

It was first released on 7 October 1998 in Italy by Bliss Corporation and became internationally successful the following year. It is the lead single of their debut album Europop. The song is the group's most popular single, reaching number one in many countries' music charts, such as Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, New Zealand, Israel, Lebanon, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Australia, Austria, Greece, Germany, and Hungary, as well as reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in January 2000.\nIn the United Kingdom, the song initially entered the top 40 purely on import sales; it was only the third single to do this. The song also received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 2001 Grammy Awards, two years after it was released.\nWritten by Eiffel 65 lead singer Jeffrey Jey, keyboardist Maurizio Lobina, and producer Massimo Gabutti, \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" was inspired by Lobina's composed opening piano hook. The producers of the song then came up with the idea for a dance song. Jey explained that his inspiration for the lyrics was how a person chooses their lifestyle. The colour blue as the main theme of the song was picked at random, with Lobina telling him to write nonsensical lyrics. Gabutti came up with the \"da ba dee\" hook. The pitch-shifted vocal effect used in the song was created with a harmonizer.\n\"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" is written in the key of G minor, with the vocal range spanning from C\u2083 to E\u266d\u2084, and is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 128 beats per minute.\nThe song's lyrics tell a story about a man who lives in a \"blue world.\" It also explains that he is \"blue inside and outside,\" which, alongside the lyric \"himself and everybody around 'cause he ain't got nobody to listen,\" and \"blue are the feelings that live inside me\" may indicate that the term blue represents his emotional state; however, the song also explains that a vast variety of what he owns is also blue, including his house and his car (\"a blue Corvette\"): different blue-coloured objects are also depicted on the single's cover. The song's hook is the sentence \"I'm blue,\" followed by a repetition of the sounds \"da ba dee da ba die\", which the hook is based around.\nThe song received mixed reviews from critics. Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that \"the hook here, with its dancy but curiously compelling singsongy rhythm and lyric, is destined to react instantly with listeners far and wide.\" He also noted that it has a \"euro sound\", and \"it's creative, it will affect listeners on both ends of the demographic spectrum, and it's anthemic.\" Entertainment Weekly positively reviewed the song, calling the song \"a fleeting, feel-good foot-tapper\" and gave the song a rating of B-. Daily Record said it is the \"strangest-sounding Euro-club hit of the summer\". The Daily Vault's Christopher Thelen described it as a \"quirky little hit\" with a \"bouncy chorus\". He also noted that \"the key is the use of the voice synthesizer\". PopMatters reviewer Chris Massey, in his review of Europop, described his initial reaction to the song as being \"really, really bad.\" However, he later stated in the review that after many repeated listenings of the song he \"loved it.\" AllMusic editor Jose F. Promis described the song as a \"hypnotic smash\" in his review of Europop.\nRolling Stone, however, in their review of Europop, gave the song a negative review, commenting that the song \"blends Cher-esque vocoder vocals, trance-like synth riffs, unabashed Eurodisco beats and a baby-babble chorus so infantile it makes the Teletubbies sound like Shakespeare.\" The magazine also placed the song on their list of the \"20 Most Annoying Songs,\" at No. 14.\nThe single, released in October 1998, was a chart-topper in many European countries. The song initially found success in France, where it debuted in August 1999 and reached number one for three weeks. It then found success in other European countries, reaching the top spot on many charts in September the same year, including Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and many other countries. It replaced \"Mambo No. 5\" by Lou Bega on many of these charts at the top spot. In the United Kingdom, the song spent three weeks at the top of the singles chart in September and"

In 1968, Bowie wrote English lyrics for the Claude Fran\u00e7ois French song \"Comme d'habitude\". After his lyrics were rejected, songwriter Paul Anka rewrote it into \"My Way\", which became famous by singer Frank Sinatra in 1969. Annoyed at the success of \"My Way\", Bowie used the song as a template and wrote \"Life on Mars?\" as a parody of Sinatra's recording. Like other songs Bowie wrote during this period, it was written primarily on piano. Recording for \"Life on Mars?\" took place on 6 August 1971, the final day of the Hunky Dory sessions. Co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, the backing band consisted of guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey; Ronson also composed the song's string arrangement. After failing to acquire pianist Dudley Moore, piano was played by Strawbs member Rick Wakeman.\nMusically, \"Life on Mars?\" is described as a \"soaring, cinematic ballad\". It is primarily glam rock, with elements of cabaret and art rock. The song has a complex structure, containing different chord changes throughout. The instruments act in tangent with one another and Bowie's vocal, steadily growing throughout its runtime. Lyrically, the song describes a girl who goes to the cinema to escape reality, using numerous surreal images. It thematically reflects optimism and the effects of Hollywood. Despite its title, the song has no connection to Mars itself; it is instead a reference to a then-recent media frenzy between the United States and Soviet Union.\nAt the height of Bowie's fame as Ziggy Stardust, RCA Records issued \"Life on Mars?\" as a single on 22 June 1973 in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for thirteen weeks. The single release was promoted by a promotional video shot by photographer Mick Rock, featuring a made-up Bowie in a turquoise suit performing the song against a white backdrop. Bowie performed the song during his concerts frequently throughout his career, performances of which have appeared on several live albums. The song also has appeared on numerous compilation albums and was remixed by Scott in 2003 and 2016, the latter being a 'stripped down' mix. The 2016 mix was accompanied by a remastered and reedited version of Rock's video.\n\"Life on Mars?\" is considered by biographers and reviewers as one of Bowie's finest songs, with many describing it as a masterpiece. Praise is also given to Bowie's vocal performance and growth as a songwriter. Several publications have also considered it one of the greatest songs of all time. The song was the namesake of the British television series Life on Mars and has featured in other films and television shows. Artists who have covered the song include singer Barbra Streisand and Nine Inch Nails members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The song charted worldwide following Bowie's death in 2016 and became a frequent tribute song for the artist; tributes by Nicholas Freestone and singer Lorde garnered widespread attention.\nIn early 1968, David Bowie's publisher, David Platz, was sharing a London office with another music publisher, Geoffrey Heath. One day, Heath brought in an acetate of the 1967 French song \"Comme d'habitude\", composed by Claude Fran\u00e7ois and Jacques Revaux, and sung by Fran\u00e7ois. Having a limited option for the song's British rights, Heath requested Platz for a songwriter to write English lyrics for the song. Platz suggested Bowie, who at that point had done other translations for him. Bowie's then-manager, Kenneth Pitt, believed that Bowie was a stronger lyricist than a composer and if he wrote \"to a strong melody composed by someone else,\" it would guarantee him a hit. Bowie's translation, titled \"Even a Fool Learns to Love\", took influence from his then-recent work as a mime and featured a reference to his 1967 track \"When I Live My Dream\". He later told Michael Parkinson in a 2002 interview that he \"wrote some really terrible lyrics [to it]\". Although he recorded an unreleased demo in February 1968, the French publishers of \"Comme d'habitude\" rejected him, primarily due to his obscurity. Soon after, songwriter Paul Anka bought the"

You Pretty Things\" is a song written by English singer-songwriter David Bowie, released on his 1971 album Hunky Dory. It was the first song he wrote for the album. Recorded as a demo, it was given to singer Peter Noone, lead singer of Herman's Hermits, who decided to release it as his debut solo single. Featuring Bowie on piano, Noone's recording was produced by Mickie Most and featured structural and lyrical differences from Bowie's later version. Released by RAK Records in April 1971 under the title \"Oh! You Pretty Thing\", the single peaked at number 12 in the UK, becoming Bowie's biggest success as a songwriter since his own single \"Space Oddity\" two years earlier.\nBowie recorded his own version at Trident Studios in London during the sessions for Hunky Dory between June and July 1971. Co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, it featured the musicians who would later become known as the Spiders from Mars: guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey. Bowie played piano, although Rick Wakeman, who played piano on the rest of the album, contended in 2017 that he contributed. \nSimilar to other tracks on the album, the themes of \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" are dark, reflecting ideals of the occultist Aleister Crowley and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, while having \"strong hints\" of Arthur C. Clarke's 1953 novel Childhood's End and making a reference to Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1871 novel The Coming Race.\n\"Oh! You Pretty Things\" is considered by music critics as one of the best songs on Hunky Dory and by some publications as one of Bowie's best songs. Bowie performed the track multiple times for BBC radio programmes between 1971 and 1972 and once on the Ziggy Stardust Tour in 1973. Bowie's version has appeared on numerous compilation albums, while Noone's was included on a 2006 compilation named after the track. Other covers have been recorded by Seu Jorge and Au Revoir Simone.\nUpon completing a promotional tour of America in early 1971, David Bowie returned to his home at Haddon Hall in Beckenham, London. After Tony Visconti moved out of Haddon, Bowie acquired a piano for the building, which he used to write songs. It was a first for Bowie, who previously composed songs primarily on acoustic guitar. In total, he composed over three-dozen songs at Haddon, many of which would appear on his next album Hunky Dory and its follow-up The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.\nThe first song Bowie wrote for Hunky Dory was \"Oh! You Pretty Things\". The song came to him in the early hours of a morning in January 1971. He recalled: \"I couldn't sleep...this song was going 'round in my head. I had to get out of bed and just play it...so that I could get back to sleep again.\" He requested studio time from his music publisher Chrysalis, whose partner Bob Grace booked time at London's Radio Luxembourg Studios to record a demo. Bowie recorded the demo sometime between February and March 1971. Paul Trynka states that it featured him on solo piano, his only accompaniment being \"the jangling of the bracelets he was wearing\". According to biographer Marc Spitz, Bowie's demos of \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and other Hunky Dory tracks \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Andy Warhol\" inspired Bowie's new manager, Tony Defries, to look into securing a new record contract for Bowie, eventually signing him with RCA Records.\nAfter recording its demo, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to producer Mickie Most, the most well-known independent producer in the UK at the time. He chose Most due to his popularity at the time, having produced numerous hits for bands such as the Animals and Herman's Hermits, telling Record Collector magazine years later: \"The most sure-fire way of getting a hit in those days was if you got Mickie Most to produce your song.\" Most liked the song and contacted Herman's Hermits' singer Peter Noone, who believed the song would be Noone's first solo hit. Noone recalled, \"[Most] only played the intro and I said, 'That's it, it's perfect!'\"\nNoone's version of \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" was recorded at London's Kingsway Studios on 26 March 1971. With Most producing, the lineup consisted of Noone on lead vocals, Bowie on piano and backing vocals, session player Clem Cattini on drums and Herbie Flowers on bass; Flowers had previously worked with Bowie on his 1969 self-titled album. According to Noone, Bowie struggled with the piano part: \"David had some trouble playing it through completely, so we recorded it in three sections, something Mickie Most helped arrange.\" Most also used acoustic guitar on the recording; according to biographer Chris O'Leary, this was \"to help the chord changes fall easier"

RCA Records then released it as a single from the album on 7 January 1972. Written following his promotional tour of America in early 1971, \"Changes\" was recorded at Trident Studios in London between June and July that year. Co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, it featured Strawbs member Rick Wakeman on piano and the musicians who would later become known as the Spiders from Mars: guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey. The song also marks the first instance of Bowie playing the saxophone on one of his recordings.\nAt this point in his career, Bowie had experimented with numerous musical styles, all of which failed to earn him stardom. The lyrics of \"Changes\" reflect this, with the first verse focusing on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream. The second verse concerns clashes between children and their parents, urging them to allow their children to be themselves as teenagers, a topic Bowie had spoken out about before. Musically, \"Changes\" is an art pop song that features a distinctive piano riff. Upon release as a single, \"Changes\" flopped like its parent album. It wasn't until the success of its follow-up The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars that the song garnered success. RCA later chose it as a B-side for the reissue of \"Space Oddity\" in 1975, which became Bowie's first UK number-one single.\nRetrospectively, \"Changes\" is regarded as one of Bowie's best songs, with many praising Bowie's vocal performance and Wakeman's piano playing. It has also appeared on several best-of lists. His biographers have viewed the track as a manifesto of his entire career, predicting a constant change of musical styles. Bowie performed \"Changes\" frequently during his concert tours; it was the final song he performed on stage before his death in 2016. The song has appeared on numerous compilation albums and is the namesake of several. Several artists have covered the song, including Australian singer Butterfly Boucher for the 2004 film Shrek 2, whose version featured new vocals from Bowie.\nAfter completing a promotional tour of America in early 1971, English singer-songwriter David Bowie returned to his home at Haddon Hall in Beckenham, London, and began writing songs. In total, he composed over three-dozen songs there, many of which would appear on his next album Hunky Dory and its follow-up The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. One of these tracks was \"Changes\", which he demoed between May and June 1971. Featuring Bowie on piano, the demo contained different lyrics than the final recording and remains unreleased.\nWork on Hunky Dory officially began at Trident Studios in London on 8 June 1971 and concluded on 6 August. \"Changes\" was recorded sometime between June and July. Co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, he recorded it with pianist Rick Wakeman and the musicians who would later become known as the Spiders from Mars: guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey. Wakeman, a noted session musician and member of the Strawbs, was asked to play during the Hunky Dory sessions and accepted. He had previously played Mellotron on Bowie's 1969 self-titled album. He recalled in 1995 that he met with Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall in Bakewell, Derbyshire, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"Life on Mars?\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\" Bowie plays a saxophone solo on the final recording \u2013 his first feature of the instrument\u2013 which he recollected was recorded \"when I was still going through ideas of using melodic saxophone.\" Bowie has said that the track \"started out as a parody of a nightclub song, a kind of throwaway\".\n\nMusically, \"Changes\" is an art pop song. While primarily in 4/4 common time, the time signature changes to 2/4 twice (on the lines \"different man\" and \"necks in it\"), and four simultaneous bars of 3/4 feature different chords on each bar and are accompanied by Woodmansey's drum fills. According to James Perone, it features a \"standard British pop song structure\", with \"clearly defined\" verses, choruses and middle-eight sections. The song begins on a tonic chord (C major 7th) piano and strings, thereafter"

In 1968, Bowie wrote English lyrics for the Claude Fran\u00e7ois French song \"Comme d'habitude\". After his lyrics were rejected, songwriter Paul Anka rewrote it into \"My Way\", which became famous by singer Frank Sinatra in 1969. Annoyed at the success of \"My Way\", Bowie used the song as a template and wrote \"Life on Mars?\" as a parody of Sinatra's recording. Like other songs Bowie wrote during this period, it was written primarily on piano. Recording for \"Life on Mars?\" took place on 6 August 1971, the final day of the Hunky Dory sessions. Co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, the backing band consisted of guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey; Ronson also composed the song's string arrangement. After failing to acquire pianist Dudley Moore, piano was played by Strawbs member Rick Wakeman.\nMusically, \"Life on Mars?\" is described as a \"soaring, cinematic ballad\". It is primarily glam rock, with elements of cabaret and art rock. The song has a complex structure, containing different chord changes throughout. The instruments act in tangent with one another and Bowie's vocal, steadily growing throughout its runtime. Lyrically, the song describes a girl who goes to the cinema to escape reality, using numerous surreal images. It thematically reflects optimism and the effects of Hollywood. Despite its title, the song has no connection to Mars itself; it is instead a reference to a then-recent media frenzy between the United States and Soviet Union.\nAt the height of Bowie's fame as Ziggy Stardust, RCA Records issued \"Life on Mars?\" as a single on 22 June 1973 in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for thirteen weeks. The single release was promoted by a promotional video shot by photographer Mick Rock, featuring a made-up Bowie in a turquoise suit performing the song against a white backdrop. Bowie performed the song during his concerts frequently throughout his career, performances of which have appeared on several live albums. The song also has appeared on numerous compilation albums and was remixed by Scott in 2003 and 2016, the latter being a 'stripped down' mix. The 2016 mix was accompanied by a remastered and reedited version of Rock's video.\n\"Life on Mars?\" is considered by biographers and reviewers as one of Bowie's finest songs, with many describing it as a masterpiece. Praise is also given to Bowie's vocal performance and growth as a songwriter. Several publications have also considered it one of the greatest songs of all time. The song was the namesake of the British television series Life on Mars and has featured in other films and television shows. Artists who have covered the song include singer Barbra Streisand and Nine Inch Nails members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The song charted worldwide following Bowie's death in 2016 and became a frequent tribute song for the artist; tributes by Nicholas Freestone and singer Lorde garnered widespread attention.\nIn early 1968, David Bowie's publisher, David Platz, was sharing a London office with another music publisher, Geoffrey Heath. One day, Heath brought in an acetate of the 1967 French song \"Comme d'habitude\", composed by Claude Fran\u00e7ois and Jacques Revaux, and sung by Fran\u00e7ois. Having a limited option for the song's British rights, Heath requested Platz for a songwriter to write English lyrics for the song. Platz suggested Bowie, who at that point had done other translations for him. Bowie's then-manager, Kenneth Pitt, believed that Bowie was a stronger lyricist than a composer and if he wrote \"to a strong melody composed by someone else,\" it would guarantee him a hit. Bowie's translation, titled \"Even a Fool Learns to Love\", took influence from his then-recent work as a mime and featured a reference to his 1967 track \"When I Live My Dream\". He later told Michael Parkinson in a 2002 interview that he \"wrote some really terrible lyrics [to it]\". Although he recorded an unreleased demo in February 1968, the French publishers of \"Comme d'habitude\" rejected him, primarily due to his obscurity. Soon after, songwriter Paul Anka bought the"

It was released on 13 September 1997 as a tribute single to Diana, Princess of Wales, with the global proceeds from the song going towards Diana's charities. In many countries, it was pressed as a double A-side with \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\". It was produced by Sir George Martin.\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" is the second highest-selling physical single of all time (behind Bing Crosby's \"White Christmas\" from 1942), and is the highest-selling single since charts began in the 1950s.\nAfter being released, \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" entered at number one in the UK Singles Chart, John's fourth UK number-one single, and became the best-selling single in UK chart history. In October it became John's ninth US number-one single, where it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks, and is the best-selling single in Billboard history; it was the first single certified Diamond in the US. The song also topped the German Singles Chart for seven weeks, the Australian Singles Chart for six weeks, and many other music charts around the world.\nThe 1997 version won John the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 40th Grammy Awards ceremony in 1998. At the 1998 Brit Awards the song was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Single. The lyrics of the earlier version of \"Candle in the Wind\", also written by Taupin, were a tribute to Marilyn Monroe. The opening lines of the 1973 version, \"Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all,\" were adapted to \"Goodbye England's rose, may you ever grow in our hearts.\" Most of the lyrics were adapted to suit the circumstances of Diana's life and death.\nOn 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, died in a car crash in Paris, France. The news shocked John, as he and the Princess were very good friends. A month earlier, he had also lost another good friend, fashion designer Gianni Versace. Pictures depicting Diana appearing to console a distraught John at Versace's funeral were featured prominently in news coverage throughout the world.\nTo cope with the grief, John wanted to pay a tribute to Diana. In his autobiography, Me, John says he had a phone call from Richard Branson who said that many of those writing in the Book of Condolence at St James Palace were quoting the lyrics of \"Candle in the Wind\". Branson asked John if he would rewrite the lyrics and sing them at the funeral. John believed that Branson had been contacted by the Spencer family. John contacted his songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, asking him to revise the lyrics of their 1973 song \"Candle in the Wind\" to honour her. George Martin was contacted to help produce the song, and added a string quartet (Peter Manning, Keith Pascoe, Levine Andrade, and Andrew Shulman), and woodwind (Pippa Davies, flute and oboe) to help balance the recording. It was recorded at Townhouse Studios in West London, immediately following the funeral.\nJohn publicly performed \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" only once, at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Westminster Abbey on 6 September 1997. He continues to sing the original version of the song at his concerts but has repeatedly turned down requests to perform the revised version, even for the memorial Concert for Diana in July 2007, having vowed never to perform it again unless asked by Diana's sons. The song has never been released (or re-released) on any of his other albums or compilations, not even his 1997 album The Big Picture, nor the 1997 Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute album (an official 2-CD release sanctioned by Diana's family that included other artists such as Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Queen, Celine Dion, and Rod Stewart). The song was included on Diana, Princess of Wales: The BBC Recording of the Funeral Service. The soundtrack was released on 30 September 1997.\n\"Candle in the Wind 1997\" became the fastest-selling single in the UK, selling 658,000 copies on its first day of release and over 1.5"

The song was released on July 22, 2016, intended to be the lead single of their fourth studio album, Music Is the Weapon, but later confirmed as the lead single from  their first greatest hits album Major Lazer Essentials. It was written by Ed Sheeran, Benjamin Levin, Karen Marie \u00d8rsted, Thomas Pentz,Justin Bieber, Jamie Scott, Philip \"Jr. Blender\" Meckseper and Henry \"King Henry\" Allen; the latter three also co-produced the song with Major Lazer. It became Major Lazer's third collaboration with M\u00d8 after \"Lean On\" and \"Lost\".\n\"Cold Water\" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song also reached number one in Australia, Austria, Belgium (Wallonia), Brazil, Canada, Finland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland; as well as the top 10 in Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Mexico, Scotland, South Africa and Spain.\nThe day before Diplo arrived in New York City in May 2016, he was \"more than a little surprised\" when Justin Bieber sent a message on Twitter about the track, \"Cold Water\", asking when it would be coming out. \"That was not planned at all,\" Diplo said. According to Diplo, the song wasn't really done, when Bieber already expressed his excitement. \"It's actually very real. Twitter is the only reason I know he's excited about the song. I don't have his number, so he Twitters at me,\" Diplo added. On May 30, Diplo announced Major Lazer's collaboration with Bieber and M\u00d8. At the time, he did not give a specific release date, only mentioning it would be released \"in a couple of weeks\" and that it would premiere through Beats 1.\nYou can tell if something\u2019s authentic or not\u2026 I felt like [M\u00d8] was so ambiguous, having grown up singing pop and punk\u2026 Her word choice and her metaphors are just so foreign from American songwriters who tend to overuse the same phrases.\n\u2014\u2009Diplo's reply to a question, which said: \"Why did Major Lazer ask M\u00d8 to be on the song?\"\nThe song initially started a project, which eventually built to Major Lazer's fourth studio album's January 2017 release. \"It's complicated because we just want to do it indie,\" described Diplo of \"Cold Water.\" \"And convincing Bieber's marketing crew to do that is hard. We don't need to have some guy tell us, 'Oh, this is what the market research says.' I'm on the ground. I see it.\" \nI had been trying to link with Benny Blanco and Ed Sheeran for years to find the right song we could all work on together and the moment I heard this one, I knew that it was the one. The timing was perfect and when we approached Justin, he was also in love with the song we all had written. I thought it would be interesting to incorporate another vocal and seeing she's family, I reached out to M\u00f8 and we decided to try our best to make something fresh and interesting as Major Lazer.\n\u2014\u2009Diplo on recording \"Cold Water\".\nOn July 1, 2016, Bieber began releasing teasers of the song, and added the song would come out later that month. On July 13, he wrote the release date was set for July 22. A low-quality version of the track leaked on Chinese radio station in July 2016, four days prior to its official release. After the latter incident, \"Cold Water\" was officially released on July 22, 2016. Moreover, it was sent to US Top 40 radio on July 26, 2016.\nThe official remix of \"Cold Water\" features a newly additional verse and replaces Bieber's second verse and the first half of Bieber's second pre-chorus by rapper Gucci Mane. It was first mentioned by both Bieber and Mane through social media. Diplo premiered the remix during Brunch Bounce at Elvis Guesthouse in New York City on July 22, 2016, the same day the original version was released. It was later released online on August 12, 2016. Mane's verse replaces Bieber's second verse and the first half of Bieber's second pre-chorus, while the rest of the song remains the same as the original version.\n\"Cold Water\", a mid-tempo song, includes dancehall and Euro club music influences, while featuring \"vibrant electronic"

It was the second single released from his 1984 album Born in the U.S.A.. Springsteen wrote the song for Donna Summer. However, his manager, Jon Landau, decided the song had hit potential, and so he kept it for the upcoming Springsteen album. It has been certified Gold in the US.\nThe song was recorded on January 25, 1982 at The Hit Factory, during the first wave of the Born in the U.S.A. sessions. At the time, the song was originally suggested for Donna Summer, but rejected by Jon Landau in favor of \"Protection\" (another song written by Springsteen). An unreleased \"outtake\" of the song, titled \"Drop On Down and Cover Me\", has long been considered a precursor to the officially released \"Cover Me\", but was actually recorded in June 1983.\nThe song peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts in October 1984. It was the second of a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles to be released from Born in the U.S.A.\nNo music video was made for the song.\n\n\n\n\nContinuing the club play goal started with \"Dancing in the Dark\", Arthur Baker created the 12-inch \"Undercover Mix\" of \"Cover Me\". This was a large-scale transformation: a new bass line was cut, an unused backing vocal by industry legend Jocelyn Brown was restored, and reggae and dub elements were introduced. It was released on October 15, 1984.\nAs with the previous effort, the result displeased some of Springsteen's more strait-laced fans, but did gain actual club play: the remix went to number 11 on Billboard's Hot Dance/Disco chart.\n\nCover Me \u2013 3:26\nJersey Girl \u2013 6:15 with an edited spoken introduction, or at 6:10 without a spoken introduction.\nThe B-side of the single, \"Jersey Girl\", was a live performance of a Tom Waits song, recorded on July 9, 1981 at Meadowlands Arena.  Springsteen had introduced the song earlier in that special River Tour homecoming stand that opened the arena, slightly rewriting it to replace a Waits line about \"whores on Eighth Avenue\" and adding a verse that included \"that little brat of yours and drop[ping] her off at your mom's.\" \"Jersey Girl\" would become a Springsteen fan favorite, although played rarely as time went on. This same recording would later be released as the closing track of Live 1975-85.\nDiffering pressings of the single had different lengths of \"Jersey Girl\", sometimes dropping most of a spoken introduction of 0:31 seconds in length. The UK 12-inch single contains the full-length version with the complete spoken introduction at 6:36. Both the sleeve and label erroneously state a playing time of 5:50.\n\"Cover Me\" (Undercover Mix) \u2013 6:09\n\"Cover Me\" (Dub 1) \u2013 4:02\n\"Cover Me\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 3:46\n\"Cover Me\" (Dub 2) \u2013 4:15\n\"Cover Me\" \u2013 3:26\n\"Pink Cadillac\" \u2013 3:33\nSpringsteen was unsure of how to play \"Cover Me\" in concert, and initially it appeared irregularly in the 1984\u20131985 Born in the U.S.A. Tour.  Then, inspired by Arthur Baker's remix, he rearranged it to open and close with a quiet, ominous, extended, echoing segment as new E Street backup singer Patti Scialfa wailed a snippet of Martha & the Vandellas' \"Nowhere to Run\" (in her one spotlight role of the show) while her future husband reverbed \"Cuh ... vuh ... me-ee-ee\", after which the song ramped up into showcase guitar work for Springsteen and Nils Lofgren.  \"Cover Me\" thus became a featured song on the tour, often opening the second set; such a performance was included on the 1986 Live/1975-85.\n\"Cover Me\" continued as a regular selection on the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express and Human Rights Now! Tours, and the 1992 leg of the \"Other Band\" Tour (now without Scialfa's part).  After December 1992 it was dropped until Springsteen's first concert in Oslo on July 7, 2008 and most recently in Philadelphia on October 20, 2009.  The song has been performed 300 times through 2008. The song has turned up as a semi-regular on the Working On A Dream Tour, especially after Springsteen and the E Street Band began playing the entire Born in the U.S.A. album in New York and Philadelphia.\nBorn in the U.S.A.

It is the third track from their 1993 album Zooropa and was released in June 1993 as the album's first single. The song features a monotonous mantra of \"don't\" commands spoken by guitarist the Edge amidst a backdrop of various sound effects and samples. The noisy composition and lyrical concept for \"Numb\" were inspired by the theme of sensory overload, which had prominently been incorporated into the Zoo TV Tour. Lead singer Bono and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. provided backing vocals on the track.\n\"Numb\" originated as a discarded song from the Achtung Baby recording sessions called \"Down All the Days\". While recording Zooropa, the band transformed the song with mixing assistance from co-producer Flood, the addition of keyboards and samples by co-producer Brian Eno, and the addition of the Edge's monotone vocals. The song was released as a VHS single, featuring music videos directed by Kevin Godley and Emergency Broadcast Network, respectively, but it did not attain widespread commercial success. U2 added \"Numb\" to their live set lists after resuming their Zoo TV Tour in May 1993, but like most songs on Zooropa it has never been performed live since the end of that tour.\n\"Numb\" originated as a discarded song from the Achtung Baby sessions called \"Down All the Days\" (later released in the premium editions of Achtung Baby's 20th anniversary reissue) that was recorded with producer Daniel Lanois at Berlin's Hansa Studios. The band was not fond of the track\u2014Zooropa co-producer Flood, who was engineer for the Achtung Baby sessions, said it was \"quite a ballady song and in the end it was decided that it didn't fit\" on that record. Guitarist the Edge said, \"It almost worked,\" calling it a \"quite unhinged electronic backing track with a very traditional melody and lyrics\" sung by lead vocalist Bono.\nDuring the Zooropa sessions of February\u2013May 1993, U2 revisited the song. At Windmill Lane Studios, producer Brian Eno began working with a stereo submix of the Berlin version, containing guitar, bass, bass pedals and drums, that Flood had created. Eno added about six or seven tracks of keyboards to the submix, mostly samples and strings from a Yamaha DX7 synthesiser. Some of the samples included Arabic voices and congas. According to Flood, \"The idea of his overdubs was to make up music out of non-musical noises, like loops of pieces of dialogue and video samples.\" The Edge called Eno's additions \"fantastic\".\nThe song's biggest contribution came while the band were organizing the final running order for Zooropa. The Edge spent several hours in another studio with the mix, experimenting with ideas; eventually adding vocals in a monotone, almost rapped delivery. He said that writing the lyrics \"came very quickly\", and that he wrote so many lyrics that two verses had to be cut from the song. His vocals were recorded at Westland Studios in Dublin, where the band spent one day for the album sessions. Flood subtly added gating to his voice \"to turn the level down when he wasn't singing.\" The addition of the Edge's vocals, for the most part, completed \"Numb\".\nBono and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. provided backing vocals. Flood treated Bono's vocals with heavy reverb to complement his \"falsetto soul voice\", while Mullen provided two tracks of backing vocals, one with a falsetto and one with his natural singing voice. After the vocals were overdubbed, Flood and the Edge mixed the track at Westland Studios. The Edge described it as \"a few hours' work and a lot of editing\", but said the mixing was \"the easiest thing in the world\" Flood concurred, calling the mixing \"very straightforward\". A sample of a Walkman cassette player rewinding was accidentally recorded onto the audio tapes, but the group liked the sound and looped it throughout the song. The final mix comprised about 15 or 16 audio tracks.\n\"Numb\" runs for 4:20 (4 minutes, 20 seconds). According to Hal Leonard Corporation\u2019s sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is played in common time at a tempo of 91 beats per minute. It is an industrial rock-influenced song featuring a noisy backdrop of sampled, rhythmic noises, including \"arcade sounds\", and a Walkman rewinding. One of the samples is from Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 propaganda film Triumph of the Will of a Hitler Youth boy playing a bass drum; a video clip of the sample was used as on-screen imagery during future concerts on the band's Zoo TV Tour. The Edge sings lead vocals, providing a monotone list of \"don't\" commands: \"Don't move / Don't talk out of"

It was also issued as the album's lead single, in May that year, and became Harrison's second US number 1, after \"My Sweet Lord\". In doing so, the song pushed Paul McCartney and Wings' \"My Love\" from the top of the Billboard Hot 100, marking the only occasion that two former Beatles have held the top two chart positions in America. The single also reached the top ten in Britain, Canada, Australia and other countries around the world.\n\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" is one of its author's most popular songs, among fans and music critics, and features a series of much-praised slide-guitar solos from Harrison. The recording signalled a deliberate departure from his earlier post-Beatles work, in the scaling down of the big sound synonymous with All Things Must Pass and his other co-productions with Phil Spector over 1970\u201371. Aside from Harrison, the musicians on the track are Nicky Hopkins, Jim Keltner, Klaus Voormann and Gary Wright. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of his desire to be free of karma and the constant cycle of rebirth; he later described the song as \"a prayer and personal statement between me, the Lord, and whoever likes it\".\nHarrison performed \"Give Me Love\" at every concert during his rare tours as a solo artist, and a live version was included on his 1992 album Live in Japan. The original studio recording appears on the compilation albums The Best of George Harrison (1976) and Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison (2009). At the Concert for George tribute to Harrison, in November 2002, Jeff Lynne performed \"Give Me Love\" with Andy Fairweather-Low and Marc Mann playing the twin slide-guitar parts. Marisa Monte, Dave Davies, Elliott Smith, Ron Sexsmith, Sting, James Taylor, Elton John, and Grace Vanderwaal are among the other artists who have covered the song.\nAs with most of the songs on his Living in the Material World album, George Harrison wrote \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" over 1971\u201372. During this period, he dedicated himself to assisting refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War, by staging two all-star benefit concerts in New York and preparing a live album and concert film for release. In addition, much of his time was spent occupied with the business and legal problems afflicting the humanitarian aid project. Author Andrew Grant Jackson writes that Harrison's frustration with this last issue resulted in a sombre quality pervading much of Material World, yet he \"pushed his disillusionment aside for the lead single ['Give Me Love']\".\nThe same period coincided with the height of Harrison's devotion to Hindu spirituality. As with his religious-themed 1970\u201371 hit, \"My Sweet Lord\", and his subsequent singles \"What Is Life\" and \"Bangla Desh\", Harrison wrote \"Give Me Love\" very quickly. Author Alan Clayson describes it as having \"flowed from George with an ease as devoid of ante-start agonies as a Yoko Ono 'think piece'\". In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison recalls of the writing process:\nSometimes you open your mouth and you don't know what you are going to say, and whatever comes out is the starting point. If that happens and you are lucky, it can usually be turned into a song. This song is a prayer and personal statement between me, the Lord, and whoever likes it.\n\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" continues the precedent that Harrison set on \"My Sweet Lord\", through its fusion of the Hindu bhajan (or devotional song) with Western gospel tradition. Author Simon Leng comments that the song repeats another of its composer's hit formulas, by using a three-syllable lyrical hook as its title, like \"My Sweet Lord\", \"What Is Life\" and \"Bangla Desh\".\nThe song's time signature is 4/4 throughout, and the musical key is F major. As on Harrison's recording, this requires the placing of a capo on the guitar's third fret, to transpose the chords from D up to the correct key. The intro features strummed acoustic guitar, similar in style to the opening of Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\". The song builds gradually from its understated introduction, with the rhythm section only fully arriving after the first bridge segment. Harrison biographer Gary Tillery describes the musical mood as \"bouncy yet soothing\".\nIn his lyrics, Harrison expresses his vision for life in the physical world. Following the opening instrumental passage, the song"

It was scheduled to be issued as a single in September that year, as the follow-up to \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\", but the release was cancelled. Music critics have traditionally viewed \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" as a highlight of the Material World album, praising its pop qualities and production, with some considering the song worthy of hit status.\nHarrison wrote and recorded \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" during a period marked by his heightened devotion to Hindu spirituality, which coincided with marital problems with his first wife, Pattie Boyd, and the financial complications affecting his Bangladesh aid project. The track is an upbeat love song in the tradition of early 1960s Brill Building songwriters. Its lyrics have invited debate among commentators as to whether Harrison is addressing a lover such as Boyd or, like the majority of his lyrics on Material World, God.\nAlthough produced by Harrison alone, the recording employs aspects of the Wall of Sound production synonymous with his former collaborator Phil Spector \u2013 through the use of reverb, two drummers and multiple acoustic rhythm guitar parts. The musicians accompanying Harrison on the track are Gary Wright, Nicky Hopkins, Ringo Starr, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. In November 1976, during the filming of their joint appearance on Saturday Night Live, Harrison performed \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" with singer Paul Simon, but the song did not appear in the broadcast.\nAs with all the new songs on his 1973 album Living in the Material World, George Harrison wrote \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" in 1971\u201372, a period of heightened devotion to Hindu spirituality on his part. \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" is a love song, and in light of problems in Harrison's marriage to Pattie Boyd at the time, Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley remarks: \"it's interesting to speculate as to who it was written about\u00a0...\" Author Jeff Walker suggests that the song's apparently non-devotional subject matter may have resulted from Harrison and Boyd's marital difficulties.\nAgainst Harrison's wishes, Boyd had resumed her modelling career in May 1971, having long felt isolated by her husband's association with the Hare Krishna movement. His Concert for Bangladesh aid project had then united the couple, according to their friend Chris O'Dell, who recalls Harrison as \"attentive and affectionate\" towards Boyd while planning the concerts that summer. The project's subsequent business and legal issues became a source of frustration for Harrison, as he spent much of 1972 negotiating with government departments for the release of the funds raised for the refugees. In February 1972, Harrison and Boyd were injured in an automobile accident in England, after which, author Alan Clayson writes, \"her recovery was impaired by George's pounding on a drum-kit that he'd set up in the next room.\"\nIn August that year, Harrison set off for a driving holiday around Europe without Boyd, a trip that Huntley describes as \"the first publicly visible signs\" of problems in the Harrisons' marriage. While in Portugal, Harrison stayed with his musician friend Gary Wright, who, Huntley suggests, \"play[ed] the diplomat\" by telling the press: \"He's writing lots of new things and he seems to be having a good time\u00a0... Sometimes he takes Pattie with him, but I feel he just felt like a holiday and wanted to get away.\"\nIn his book The Words and Music of George Harrison, Ian Inglis writes that \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" incorporates many of the elements of pop composition pioneered during the early 1960s at New York's Brill Building, where songwriters such as Barry Mann, Carole King and Gerry Goffin began their careers. Inglis lists these \"stock motifs\" as \"a repetitive and attractive melody\", \"a stereotypical choice of language\", \"the familiar topic of lost, or unrequited, love\" and \"the conventional form of address from a man to a woman, in the persistent use of 'baby'\". These elements appear in the song's chorus, where Harrison sings: \"How I love you / Baby, so don't let me wait too long.\"\nHarrison biographer Simon Leng views \"pop-soul music\" as \"the obvious root\" of \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" and cites musical tension as one facet of the pop-soul style that Harrison adopts. This tension is evident in the \"implie[d] dissonance\" during the verses, Leng adds, when Harrison moves from an F major chord to D-flat major. In reference to a lyric in the verses, Clayson suggests: \"Although 'Don't Let Me Wait Too Long' betrayed that George's sublimation of lust"

The project's subsequent business and legal issues became a source of frustration for Harrison, as he spent much of 1972 negotiating with government departments for the release of the funds raised for the refugees. In February 1972, Harrison and Boyd were injured in an automobile accident in England, after which, author Alan Clayson writes, \"her recovery was impaired by George's pounding on a drum-kit that he'd set up in the next room.\"\nIn August that year, Harrison set off for a driving holiday around Europe without Boyd, a trip that Huntley describes as \"the first publicly visible signs\" of problems in the Harrisons' marriage. While in Portugal, Harrison stayed with his musician friend Gary Wright, who, Huntley suggests, \"play[ed] the diplomat\" by telling the press: \"He's writing lots of new things and he seems to be having a good time\u00a0... Sometimes he takes Pattie with him, but I feel he just felt like a holiday and wanted to get away.\"\nIn his book The Words and Music of George Harrison, Ian Inglis writes that \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" incorporates many of the elements of pop composition pioneered during the early 1960s at New York's Brill Building, where songwriters such as Barry Mann, Carole King and Gerry Goffin began their careers. Inglis lists these \"stock motifs\" as \"a repetitive and attractive melody\", \"a stereotypical choice of language\", \"the familiar topic of lost, or unrequited, love\" and \"the conventional form of address from a man to a woman, in the persistent use of 'baby'\". These elements appear in the song's chorus, where Harrison sings: \"How I love you / Baby, so don't let me wait too long.\"\nHarrison biographer Simon Leng views \"pop-soul music\" as \"the obvious root\" of \"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\" and cites musical tension as one facet of the pop-soul style that Harrison adopts. This tension is evident in the \"implie[d] dissonance\" during the verses, Leng adds, when Harrison moves from an F major chord to D-flat major. In reference to a lyric in the verses, Clayson suggests: \"Although 'Don't Let Me Wait Too Long' betrayed that George's sublimation of lust"

It was released in April 1989 as the lead single from his first solo album, Full Moon Fever. The song was co-written by Petty and Jeff Lynne, also his writing partner for the album. It reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Album Rock Tracks chart for five weeks, starting the album's road to multi-platinum status.\nPetty recalled the recording of this song to Mojo magazine: \"At the session George Harrison sang and played the guitar. I had a terrible cold that day, and George went to the store and bought a ginger root, boiled it and had me stick my head in the pot to get the ginger steam to open up my sinuses, and then I ran in and did the take.\"\nA message of defiance against unnamed forces of difficulty and possibly oppression, the lyric is set against a mid-tempo beat:\nWell I know what's right, I got just one life\n\nin a world that keeps on pushin' me around\n\nbut I'll stand my ground, and I won't back down\nDue to its themes, the song was played often on American radio following the September 11 attacks.  Petty and the Heartbreakers played a quiet but resolute version of the song at the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon following the 2001 attacks.\nIn the 2007 documentary Runnin' Down a Dream, Petty said that he felt some initial hesitation about releasing the song, given its clear and unabashed message.\nIn January 2015, it was revealed that an agreement had been reached whereby Petty and Jeff Lynne would be credited as co-writers of Sam Smith's song \"Stay with Me\" and receive 12.5% of its royalties. Petty's publishing company had contacted Smith's publisher after noticing a likeness between \"Stay with Me\" and \"I Won't Back Down\". Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith plagiarized him, saying \"All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times you catch it before it gets out the studio door but in this case it got by. Sam's people were very understanding of our predicament and we easily came to an agreement\". Smith claimed not to have heard \"I Won't Back Down\" before writing \"Stay with Me\", but acknowledged the similarity after listening to the song, calling it \"a complete coincidence\". Petty and Lynne were not eligible for a Grammy Award (\"Stay with Me\" was nominated for three awards at the 57th annual ceremony, winning two of them) as the Recording Academy considered \"Stay with Me\" to have been interpolated from \"I Won't Back Down\" by Smith, James Napier, and William Phillips, the writers of \"Stay with Me\"; Petty and Lynne were instead given certificates to honor their participation in the work, as is usual for writers of sampled or interpolated work.\nTom Petty \u2013 lead vocals and backing vocals, acoustic guitar\nMike Campbell \u2013 slide guitar\nGeorge Harrison \u2013 acoustic guitar, backing vocals\nJeff Lynne \u2013 bass, backing vocals\nHowie Epstein \u2013 backing vocals\nPhil Jones \u2013 Linn LM-1, drums\nRingo Starr \u2013 Linn LM-1, drums in video\n\n\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush used \"I Won't Back Down\" at campaign events during the 2000 presidential campaign but was compelled to stop using the song after receiving a cease and desist letter from Petty's publisher. Petty then went on to perform the song at Al Gore's home after Gore conceded the election to President Bush. Jim Webb used the song for his successful bid for one of Virginia's U.S. Senate seats in 2006, as did Hillary Clinton during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign.  The song was also used at campaign events for Congressman Ron Paul of Texas during the 2008 Republican presidential primary campaign, as well as for events for his Campaign for Liberty. The song was also played at an event for Republican Connecticut gubernatorial nominee, Tom Foley. The song was also played at the 2012 Democratic National Convention after a speech delivered by President Bill Clinton, in which President Barack Obama came out on stage to salute him.\nIn June 2020, Petty's family issued a cease and desist letter to President Donald Trump's campaign for its use of \"I Won't Back Down\" at Trump's rally in Tulsa on June 20, 2020. The letter stated: \"Trump was in no way authorized to use this song to further a campaign that leaves too many Americans and common sense behind. Both the late Tom Petty and his family firmly stand against racism and discrimination of any kind. Tom Petty would never want a song of his used for a campaign of hate. He liked to bring people"

The song was released on November\u00a014,\u00a01995 as the second single from Carey's fifth studio album, Daydream (1995) by Columbia Records. The artists co-wrote the song with Walter Afanasieff, who co-produced it with Carey. Lyrically, the song speaks about the death of a loved one, how the protagonist took their presence for granted and misses them, and finally about seeing the person in heaven. Both Carey and Boyz II Men wrote the song about specific people in their lives, being inspired by sufferers of the AIDS epidemic, which was globally prevalent at the time.\n\"One Sweet Day\" received universal acclaim from music critics, many of whom praised its lyrical content and vocals while calling it a standout track on Daydream. It was ranked first in Rolling Stone's reader's poll for the Best Collaboration of All Time. The song spent 16 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, becoming the longest-running number-one song in the chart's history at the time, a record held for 23 years. Subsequently, Billboard ranked it as the ninth best charting single of the 1990s. Internationally, the song topped the charts in Canada and New Zealand; and reached the top-ten in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\nCarey performed \"One Sweet Day\" live alongside Boyz II Men at the 38th Grammy Awards ceremony, held on February 26, 1996. Additionally, the song was performed at Princess Diana's memorial service in September 1997. \"One Sweet Day\" was part of the set list on several of Carey's succeeding tours, making its debut during the album's accompanying set of concerts, the Daydream World Tour. It is featured on her compilation albums, #1's (1998), Greatest Hits (2001), The Ballads (2008), and #1 to Infinity (2015).\nThe music video for \"One Sweet Day\" was filmed in February 1995, and features snippets of Carey and Boyz II Men in and around the studio, and recording the song. The busy schedule of both acts did not allow time to shoot a proper video. Carey later said that she was content a real music video was never filmed, fearing that no video could truly capture the song's strong lyrical message. Critics felt the video choice was wise, and agreed that the simple concept paid homage to the song's selfless message.\n\"One Sweet Day\" was a song that Carey wrote with the R&B group Boyz II Men. After Carey's friend and past collaborator David Cole (of C&C Music Factory) died, she began writing and developing a song that would pay homage to him and all the friends and family her fans had lost along life's journey. Carey had the idea and chorus composed, and after meeting with Boyz II Men, they realized they too had a similar idea in development. Together, using Carey's chorus and idea, as well as the melody they had produced, they wrote and composed the song. The song was produced by Carey and Afanasieff, who built on the song's melody and added various grooves and beats. Carey expressed how the song was \"meant to be\" and how all the pieces fit into place:\n\"I wrote the initial idea for 'One Sweet Day' with Walter, and I had the chorus...and I stopped and said, 'I really wanna do this with Boyz II Men,' because...obviously I'm a big fan of theirs and I just thought that the work was crying out for them, the vocals that they do, so I put it away and said, 'Who knows if this could ever happen, but I just don't wanna finish this song because I want it to be our song if we ever do it together. [The] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [it] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan \"Nate\" Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had basically the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate had a lot to do with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story.\"\nAfter they began working on the song, Carey began to incorporate other lyrics into the chorus, trying to make the song relatable to"

It was written by Carey and Lionel Cole, and produced by the former and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The song was released as the album's lead single on September 30, 2002, and a shorter version was used as the ending credits theme for a 2002 Japanese drama known as You're Under Arrest. Classified by Carey as a ballad, it is influenced by R&B music genres, and features a simple and under-stated piano melody, backed by soft electronic synthesizers. \"Through the Rain\" was meant to be an insight into Carey personal struggles throughout 2001, and lyrically talks about encouraging others.\nThe song has been well-received, with many complimenting its inspirational lyrical content, and described it as an open window into Carey's personal life for listeners. Commercially, it was, at the time, Carey's worst charting lead single on the US Billboard Hot 100, and her first lead single to that point not to reach the top ten in the United States. Though stalling at number 81, it became successful on the Billboard dance charts, hitting number 1 for a week in the United States as well as topping the Hot Singles Sales chart. The song achieved higher placements in international markets, reaching the top spot in Spain and peaking within the top ten in Canada, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\nCarey performed \"Through the Rain\" live on several television and award show appearances around the world. She debuted the song at the 2002 NRJ Awards, and features it on a one-hour special titled Mariah Carey: Shining Through the Rain, which aired three days later on MTV. In the United States, Carey performed the song on Today, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and American Music Awards of 2003s. Throughout Europe, Carey performed the song on The Graham Norton Show and on talent competition, Fame Academy. Additionally, \"Through the Rain\" was included on the set-list of Carey's Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey, which spanned throughout 2003\u201304.\nThe music video, directed by Dave Meyers, was set in the late 1960s. It features a past and present story-line based on Carey's childhood, and stars J. D. Williams and Jamie-Lynn Sigler as the singer's parents. The video begins with past scenes of Carey's mother being disowned by her family after becoming romantically involved with a black man, and finds the singer in the present walking through a heavy rainstorm in New York.\nIn 2000, Carey parted from Columbia Records and signed a record-breaking $100 million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records America (EMI Records). She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Tommy Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. However, in July 2001, Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown. Due to this situation, Virgin and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of Carey's film Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name. Both the releases received negative feedback and were commercially unsuccessful. This also resulted in her deal with Virgin being bought out for $50\u00a0million. Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year. Carey later said that her time at Virgin was \"a complete and total stress-fest [...] I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that.\" Later that year, she signed a contract with Island Records, valued at more than $24\u00a0million, and launched the record label MonarC. To add further to Carey's emotional burdens, her father, with whom she had little contact since childhood, died of cancer that year.\nThroughout the first years of her career, Carey's musical styles mainly involved pop influenced R&B. Additionally, her image was of a reserved and modestly dressed female, or as Carey's later described it \"the 90s version of Mary Poppins\". As the 1990s wore on, Carey began featuring rappers on remixes, and began infusing hip-hop into her musical palette. As her music changed, so too did her image, which became more sexual, and aimed at younger audiences than the more contemporary appeal of her earlier works. According to Michael Paoletta from"

It was released on February 18, 2017, by Polydor Records and Interscope Records, as the lead single from her fifth studio album, Lust for Life (2017). The song was written and produced by Del Rey, Benny Blanco, Emile Haynie and Rick Nowels, with additional production by Kieron Menzies. Its release was first teased with promotional posters hung in Los Angeles on February 17, after which the release date was pushed up due to leaked versions of the song surfacing online the same day.\nThe song received acclaim from critics. Eve Barlow of Pitchfork wrote that \"'Love' is an ode to allowing yourself to feel\" and that it \"reassures the listener that the feeling can still lift, that love can still conquer.\" Barlow also gave the song the Best New Track designation. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone called the song \"anthemic\" and Frank Guan of Vulture called \"Love\" \"marvellously good\".\nPitchfork listed \"Love\" as the 28th-best song of 2017 in their annual ranking.\n\"Love\" debuted at No. 44 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it her highest-charting song on the chart since Ultraviolence's lead single, \"West Coast\". It also debuted at No. 2 on Hot Rock Songs, exceeding the No. 3 peak of \"Young and Beautiful\" in 2013. \"Love\" also launched as her first No. 1 on Rock Digital Song Sales (46,000 downloads sold, according to Nielsen Music) and at No. 5 on Rock Streaming Songs (6.6 million domestic streams). The song also peaked at No. 9 on the Digital Songs chart.\nThe music video was in production in June 2016, as reported by BreatheHeavy.com. Del Rey's hairstylist, Anna Cofone, also shared photos of her makeup kit on set on Instagram, which she later deleted.\nOn February 20, 2017, Del Rey announced the music video on an Instagram livestream. Shortly after the livestream it was made available on YouTube. The music video garnered over 19 million views within a week.\nThe music video begins in black and white, showing Del Rey singing on stage in front of a small audience, intercut with young adult couples getting ready for a day at the beach. As Del Rey sings the chorus, the video fades into color, and scenes of the couples floating through the solar system in their cars and alone. Towards the end of the video, Del Rey is also seen performing with her band on the surface of the moon, with the camera turning to the sky, where a symbolic black hole can be seen. It was directed by Rich Lee.\nDaniel Kreps of Rolling Stone called the video \"dreamy\", while writing that the clip \"alternates between black-and-white and washed-out color, Del Rey sings \"Love\" juxtaposed with footage of people \"young and in love.\" Kelsey J. Waite of A.V Club wrote that \"'Love' sends you tumbling through space\", calling it a \"stunning sci-fi video\". Luke Morgan Britton of NME wrote that \"The video sees Del Rey dramatically performing in Space\", while Ben Kaye of Consequence of Sound called the clip \"romantic\".\nDel Rey first performed \"Love\" at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas on March 17, 2017.\nThe song can be heard in the pilot episode of the television show Siesta Key.

They explained, \"At the time I was going through a breakup. It's about the vulnerability of coming out of a very serious relationship and having a tough time with it. It also at the same time calls out a big misconception with the line, 'You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody,' which again comes from that vulnerability with mixed emotions.\" In an interview with the BBC, Lovato named \"Tell Me You Love Me\" as their favorite track on the album, later explaining that \"It said exactly what I was wanting to tell that person. I wanted to hear them tell me that they loved me.\"\nLovato published a black-and-white teaser on August 23, 2017, on social media, announcing the new album, with \"Tell Me You Love Me\" playing in the background.

It also serves as the final official single from the band before they disbanded in 2011. It was written by Fernando Garibay, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, and The Jackie Boyz, and produced by Garibay. The song's development began while the Sugababes travelled to the United States during April 2009, in which they collaborated with various high-profile producers. The song was re-recorded to feature the vocals of Jade Ewen following the departure of Keisha Buchanan in September 2009. \"Wear My Kiss\" is an uptempo pop song that references the items which compose a man's outfit.\nMany critics praised the song as radio-friendly and catchy, although some regarded it as uninspiring and average. The single reached the top ten on the charts in the UK, Ireland and Scotland, and also charted in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Its music video was directed by Martin Weisz in December 2009. The green screen effect was used to produce the video's scenes, which include clones of the group's members. Critics commended the video for its futuristic concept. The Sugababes performed \"Wear My Kiss\" at the Fight Cervical Cancer in Style fundraising event, on Eurovision: Your Country Needs You, and at Chester Rocks in 2011.\nThe Sugababes travelled Los Angeles and New York City in April 2009 to work on their seventh studio album Sweet 7 (2010). They signed a record deal with Jay Z's record label Roc Nation, which resulted in collaborations with high-profile producers including Stargate and RedOne. \"Wear My Kiss\" was written by Fernando Garibay, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, Carlos Battey and Steven Battey, the latter two collectively known by their stage name The Jackie Boyz. Garibay produced the song, recorded the Sugababes' vocals, provided the track's instrumentation, and completed its programming and arrangement. The Jackie Boyz provide background vocals for the song. Dave Pensado mixed \"Wear My Kiss\" at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, California; AJ Nunez was the assistant. Additional vocal production was provided by Mike Stevens and Marcus Byrne, while additional vocal mixing was completed by Jeremy Wheatley at TwentyOne Studios, London, with assistance from Richard Edgeler. \"Wear My Kiss\" was recorded and tracked at F2 Studios in Hollywood, California.\n\"Wear My Kiss\" is an uptempo pop song. David Balls of Digital Spy described it \"a fuzzed-up pop thumper\". The song is composed of \"thick\" beats, \"sexy\" verses and \"raunchy\" lyrics. The chorus features a chanted 'da-da-da' hook, which according to Al Fox of BBC Music is evocative of the group's 2003 single \"Hole in the Head\". Andy Gill of The Independent noted that the song sees the Sugababes \"effectively subjugated to the status of accessories\"; lyrically, the singers compare themselves to a tie, watch and shoes of a man's outfit. During the pre-hook, group member Heidi Range sings, \"I\"m just a pretty little thing / That'll make you wanna sing / Make you wanna buy a ring\". \"Wear My Kiss\" is reminiscent of songs performed by British girl group Girls Aloud and American recording artist Lady Gaga.\nIn September 2009, speculation arose that group member Amelle Berrabah had left the Sugababes following reports of tension with band member Keisha Buchanan. However, it was announced on 21 September 2009 that Buchanan, the sole original member of the group, had officially left the Sugababes. Buchanan clarified the departure on her official Twitter account, writing: \"I'm sad to say that I am no longer a part of the Sugababes ... Although it was not my choice to leave, it's time to enter a new chapter in my life ... Sometimes a breakdown in communication and lack of trust can result in many different things.\" Buchanan was replaced by former Eurovision contestant Jade Ewen. As a result of the line-up change, \"Wear My Kiss\" was re-recorded for the inclusion of vocals from new member Ewen and the removal of vocals from Buchanan.\nIn October 2009, it was reported that \"Wear My Kiss\" would be released as the third single from Sweet 7 on 8 February 2010. The song was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 21 February 2010 as a digital download, and as a CD single the following day. During an interview with David Balls of Digital Spy, group member Heidi Range explained the reason for the song's release as the album's third single, saying: \"It's had a really good response from radio and our fans"

Cabello's vocals span from G\u2083 to A\u2085.\n\nAlexis Petridis of The Guardian portrayed, \"The piano ballad Consequences is an unexpected triumph: eschewing the usual melodramatics, Cabello\u2019s vocal is controlled, delicate and affecting, while the accompaniment vaguely recalls \u2013 of all things \u2013 Asleep by the Smiths.\"\nWriting for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined the track, \"Consequences exhibits greater-than-average originality. 'Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating,' croons Cabello; 'loving you had consequences'.\" Dennis Leupold of Rolling Stone expressed, \"this girl definitely puts more of her heart into the emo. Cabello has a real flair for melancholy piano break-up ballads, as in 'Consequences,' where she ponders the high price of love: 'Dirty tissues, trust issues.'\" Jamieson Cox of Pitchfork stated that \"The overwrought one-two punch of 'Consequences'\u2014which sounds a little like her attempt at something like Rihanna's 'Stay'\" Sam Lansky of Time applauded its \"pretty-ballad\" songwriting for showcasing Cabello's voice while citing the song as a \"heartfelt\" track both lyrically and musically.\nNick Levine of NME penned, \"Stripped-down piano ballad \u2018Consequences\u2019 feels even more candid: she tells a former partner that 'loving you was dumb and dark and cheap,' and says she 'lost a little weight because I wasn't eating.'\"\nA music video for the orchestral version, directed by Dave Meyers, was released on October 10, 2018. It featured an appearance by Dylan Sprouse. In the video, Cabello and Sprouse run around, kiss and make music together. Cabello walks around a park while reminiscing about the couple's relationship.

It was released on January 23, 2012, by Hollywood Records, as the second and final single from the album. The song was written and produced by Josh Alexander and Billy Steinberg. \"Give Your Heart a Break\" incorporates drums, violin and strings. The latter two, according to music critics, are reminiscent of those used in Coldplay's \"Viva la Vida\". Lyrically, the song chronicles the protagonist's attempt to win over their lover who has been hurt in a previous relationship and is fearful of committing again.\n\"Give Your Heart a Break\" received acclaim from music critics, who mostly praised the production and Lovato's vocals. The single debuted at number 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number 16 on the chart, as well as reaching number one on the Billboard Pop Songs chart. The song has debuted at number 33 in New Zealand and has peaked at number nine, marking the first time Lovato had two top 10 singles from one album in the country.\nOriginally, it was announced the second single from the album \"Who's That Boy\" (featuring Dev), but later was scrapped due to Dev's pregnancy. \"Give Your Heart a Break\" was written and produced by Josh Alexander and Billy Steinberg, who are known for their work on The Veronicas' sophomore studio album, Hook Me Up, as well as JoJo's \"Too Little Too Late\". Alexander is credited with having a bigger hand in the song's production, handling all the instruments while programming, recording and engineering the song. Chris Garcia shared engineering credits with Alexander while Scott Roewe is credited with providing Logic and Pro Tools technology. According to MTV, Lovato explained that despite the play on the word \"heartbreak\" in the title, the song is about the exact opposite. \"Last year I began working on a song about a different kind of love,\" they said. \"It's a song about showing someone you love that you're the one right in front of them. This is a song about faith.\"\n\"Give Your Heart a Break\" is three minutes and twenty-five seconds long. The song uses the instruments such as the suspenseful strings that sounds similar to that used in Coldplay's \"Viva la Vida\".  According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc., \"Give Your Heart a Break\" is written in the key of G\u266d major. It is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 123 beats per minute. The song follows the chord progression of C\u266d2\u2013G\u266d\u2013A\u266dm7 (add 4)\u2013D\u266d. Lovato's vocal range spans over two octaves, from the low note of E\u266d\u2083 to the high note of G\u266d\u2085.\n\"Give Your Heart a Break\" received acclaim from music critics. Joe DeAndrea of AbsolutePunk praised the song along with \"Mistake\" as ballads going \"far and beyond anything in Lovato's prior arsenal. It sets a mark as to what should be expected from similar artists such as [them], but in the process, distancing [themself] from being grouped with them becoming a solo entity.\" Jason Scott of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer noted that the song, along with \"Mistake\" and \"Hold Up\", feature \"electrically forceful instrumentation\". Jocelyn Vena of MTV complimented it as a smart dance song, along with \"Hold Up\".\nIn another extensive review, Laurence Green from musicOMH praised the track, calling it an \"exceptionally brilliant track,\" while commenting that they \"become the true pop heroine; backed up by infinitely bigger, better choruses.\" Sam Lansky, a writer and editor for MTV's Buzzworthy Blog, lauded the recording for presenting Lovato's vocals as a masterpiece and praised the production as \"superb\".\n\"Give Your Heart a Break\" peaked at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100, marking Lovato's seventh highest peaking single in the nation. The song topped the US Pop Songs chart, becoming Lovato's first number one there, while reaching number 12 on the US Adult Top 40 chart, number 16 on the US Adult Contemporary chart, and at number 21 on the US Digital Songs chart. With 25 weeks, \"Give Your Heart a Break\" previously shared the record of longest ascendance to the summit of the Mainstream Top 40 with Cee Lo Green's \"Fuck You\". In August 2021, Billboard revealed the song is Lovato's most-heard on US radio accumulating 2.9 billion all-format audience impressions.\nInternationally, \"Give Your Heart a Break\" performed moderately; on the Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) chart, the song peaked at number 32, their first appearance and highest"

They explained, \"At the time I was going through a breakup. It's about the vulnerability of coming out of a very serious relationship and having a tough time with it.

It was written by Isaac Hasson, Lindy Robbins and Mher Filian and produced by SuperSpy, for Lovato's second studio album of the same name. It was released as the album's lead single on June 23, 2009, through Hollywood Records. The song was the only single from Here We Go Again released in North America. \"Here We Go Again\" is a power pop song with guitar lines and pop hooks and the lyrics speak of the protagonist's on-off relationship with a hesitant boyfriend.\nThe song received positive reviews from critics, who praised its pop hook and made comparisons to works of Kelly Clarkson. \"Here We Go Again\" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Lovato's first top 40 hit on the chart as a solo artist. The song was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2014. It also peaked at number 38 in New Zealand and in the lower region of the Canadian Hot 100.\nLovato released their debut studio album, Don't Forget, in September 2008. Shortly thereafter in January 2009, they had already begun writing material for their sophomore effort. The recording sessions for the album began in January 2009, right after filming from the first season of Sonny with a Chance. According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly finished in just two weeks. Unlike Don't Forget, Lovato did not collaborate with the Jonas Brothers for their second album as they wanted to see what their sound would be like without their input. \"Here We Go Again\" was written by Isaac Hasson, Lindy Robbins and Mher Filian, and produced by Hasson and Filian under the production name SuperSpy. The duo also co-wrote and produced the album track \"U Got Nothin' on Me\".\n\"Here We Go Again\" was recorded at three different recording studios in California; SuperSpy Studios in Los Angeles, Resonate Studios in Burbank, and The Jungle Room in Glendale. Additional recording took place at Safe House Studios in Greensboro, North Carolina. Co-writer Robbins contributed backing vocals. Hasson provided programming, guitars and synths, and Filian handled programming and keys. The instruments were played by Dorian Crozier, who provided drums, and Kenny Johnson, who played the bass. The song was ultimately mixed by Chris Lord-Alge. \"Here We Go Again\" premiered during Planet Premiere on Radio Disney on June 17, 2009, and was released as the lead single for the album of the same name via digital download on June 23, through Hollywood Records. It was later released in Australia and New Zealand on July 17, 2009.\n\"Here We Go Again\" is an uptempo pop-rock song, with guitar lines and pop hooks. Critics made comparisons with works by Kelly Clarkson, particularly the song \"Since U Been Gone\". According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, \"Here We Go Again\" is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderately fast tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F major and Lovato's vocal range spans from the low note of F\u2083 to the high note of A\u2085. It has a basic sequence of F\u2013Dm\u2013Dm\u2013Gm/B\u266d\u2013F as its chord progression. The song's lyrics chronicle the protagonist's on-off relationship with an indecisive boy as they sing that \"Something about you is so addictive\". Lovato explained: \"So it's about, basically, being in a relationship where you break-up and you make-up, and you break-up and it's like 'Here we go again, we just keep doing this over and over'.\"\n\n\"Here We Go Again\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. The Arizona Republic's Ed Masley referred it to as \"an explosion of pop hooks delivered with a winning blend of heartache and bravado\". Kerri Mason of Billboard called the song a potential hit single and noted that Lovato \"almost sounds like Kelly Clarkson's kid sister\". Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times compared it to Clarkson's \"Since U Been Gone\" and wrote that Lovato \"tells a guy where to stick it over buff guitar lines\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the album \"not quite as much fun\" as Don't Forget, \"but still fun, particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like 'Here We Go Again'.\" Erlewine also named it one of the best tracks on the album. Chicago Tribune's Althea Legaspi referred it to as \"anthemic\" and \"catchy\", while Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra described it was not as \"immediate a grabber\" as Lovato's previous singles.\nIn the"

The song makes direct reference to fictional FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the two main characters of the popular sci-fi TV series The X-Files who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In an interview Cerys Matthews, co-writer of the song, explained that while she was not a serious fan of the show, the basic premise of the series matched the concept of what she was trying to express.\n\"Mulder and Scully\" was released as the second single from International Velvet on 19 January 1998. Originally, it was supposed to be the first single but was delayed due to circumstances beyond the band's control. The song was Catatonia's first single in the United States. \"Mulder and Scully\" became the group's break-out hit and received a mixed to positive response from the music press; many critics felt that, musically, the song was well played, but that the track's pop culture references were out of place.\nThe song reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, making it Catatonia's highest-charting UK song. It also became a hit in Iceland, reaching number two, and in Ireland, where it peaked at number 17. A music video was released that featured the band performing the track while Mulder and Scully, played by look-alikes, search the concert venue with torches.\nThe song makes direct reference to FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the two main characters of the popular sci-fi TV series The X-Files who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Although the title and refrain reference the popular show, the song has little to do with the two characters. Instead, the reference to Mulder and Scully is a metaphor for a relationship being so \"strange\" that it could be \"a case for Mulder and Scully\", a reference to the paranormal cases\u2014the titular X-Files\u2014the two investigate on the show. Cerys Matthews, the co-writer of the song, explained that the conceit of the song was \"about asking Mulder and Scully to figure out this thing called love. I like the idea of two people going round the planet investigating odd phenomena, in this case love\".\nMatthews later admitted that she was not a serious fan of the show, but that she only used the line because it adequately described the type of relationship she was singing about. In an interview with the Daily Record, she explained, \"I'm not a big fan of [The X-Files] but I got the line about things getting strange for Mulder and Scully from watching the odd episode\". After questioning, she later said that she would \"prefer to go out for a night on the town with Gazza and Chris Evans than meet [The X-Files] stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny\". Matthews also related that \"I'm sure loads of people bought the record by mistake, but who cares? They should be flattered we wrote a song about [The X-Files] anyway\".\nThe song was met with mixed to positive reviews from critics; many reviewers lauded the band's musical composition, but maligned the track for its heavy reliance on pop culture references.\nThe Sunday Mirror wrote positively of the song and called it \"hard rockin'\". Ben Myers from the now-defunct music magazine Melody Maker named the song the \"Single of the Week\" and called it \"fantastic\". He noted that \"they've damn near written a perfect pop song. The first best single of the year\". Jerry Rubino, host of the popular radio show \"Left of Center\", named the song one of his favorite \"Brit Things\". Sarah Zupko from PopMatters noted that the song was built around \"somewhat silly X-Files references\", but that it possessed \"hooks to die for\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the song a relatively positive review and singled it out as an \"AllMusic Pick\". He also praised the song's \"terrific [hook]\" but was slightly critical of the \"self-conscious pop culture references\". Despite this, he noted the band was successfully able to \"bring memorable melodies to the [song]\". A subsequent review by AllMusic awarded the single, by itself, two-and-a-half stars out of five. NME called the song \"little more than fodder for nostalgia TV\", written by a \"lazy television researcher's imagination\".\nCerys Matthews and the band were extremely pleased with the final product, calling it a \"better song\" than \"All Around the World\" by Oasis, the single's main competitor at the time. Matthews later said that the lyrics for \"Mulder and Scully\" were \"good,"

Sasha Fierce (2008). The track was released as the eighth single from the album on September 22, 2009. A remixed version featuring Lady Gaga was released on November 17, 2009. Musically, the song consists of simple lyrics and hidden innuendos, with Gaga and Beyonc\u00e9 trading verses with each other in the song's remix. The lyrics refer to putting up a sexy display to be recorded on a video phone.\nThe song received generally mixed reviews from most music critics. Some noted that Gaga's featured appearance in the song's remix failed to add anything to the tune. The original version charted in the lower regions of the charts of Australia and its urban music chart, Spain, the United Kingdom and on the R&B charts in the United States. The remixed version charted at number sixty-five on the US Billboard Hot 100, and topped the Dance Club Songs chart in the country. The remix also charted in Australia and its urban music chart, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand, while it bubbled under the main music charts of Belgium.\nA music video was created to accompany the remix featuring Gaga. It portrayed her and Knowles in a number of costumes, brandishing colorful guns towards men and paying homage to the film Reservoir Dogs (1992) and pin-up legend Bettie Page. It received mixed feedback from critics, who called it un-interesting, and felt that it did not present anything new. However, they complimented the costumes and the cinematic homage of the video. In the United States, the video went on to win the BET award for Video of the Year.\n\"Video Phone\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Shondrae Crawford, Sean Garrett and Lady Gaga in the remixed version. It was produced by Bangladesh, The Pen and Knowles. Initially, \"Video Phone\" was sent to US urban contemporary radios on September 22, 2009. The release was later recalled and in October 2009, Life & Style reported that Knowles and pop singer Lady Gaga were collaborating for a remixed version of the song. The remixed version featured both Knowles and Lady Gaga trading verses with one another. The remixed version of the song that features Lady Gaga was included on the 2009 deluxe edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce.\nMusically, \"Video Phone\" is a crunk song. According to the sheet music published at Sheetmusicplus.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate groove tempo of 120 beats per minute and in the key of Eb minor. It consists of simple lyrics, with hidden innuendos, and is backed by thin-spread beats; Knowles and Gaga uttering gasps and groans while singing the song. Chris Willman from Yahoo! said that the lyrics are a \"celebration of Skype sex and putting on a solo show, on camera, for a guy you just met at the club.\"\nThe female protagonist sings how she will dance for a man, while he is filming her with his videophone, this being illustrated in the line, \"Press 'record' and I'll let you film me\", and \"You want me naked? If you like this position you can tape it\". According to James Reed of The Boston Globe the lines \"What? You want me naked/ If you likin' this position, you can tape it\" are sung with an accent which was \"part Long Island, part Barbados\". Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club commented that \"Video Phone\" is very similar to Missy Elliott's songs. Rolling Stone's Christian Hoard and The Washington Post's J. Freedom du Lac found similarities between \"Video Phone\" and the songs by rock band Nine Inch Nails. San Francisco Chronicle's Aidin Vaziri noted that the song sounded like it was swiped from Bj\u00f6rk.\nThe song received mixed reviews.  Alexis Petridis from The Guardian compared the song to \"Diva\", stating that \"Video Phone\" is \"Almost equally weird, but much better, [and it] introduces us to the unlikely figure of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, amateur pornographer: 'You want me naked? If you like this position you can tape it.' She"

Written by George Harrison, the group's lead guitarist, it was released on a non-album single in May 1969, as the B-side to \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\". The song was subsequently included on the band's compilation albums Hey Jude, 1967\u20131970 and Past Masters, Volume Two. Although \"Old Brown Shoe\" remains a relatively obscure song in the band's catalogue, several music critics view it as one of Harrison's best compositions from the Beatles era and especially admire his guitar solo on the track.\nThe lyrics to \"Old Brown Shoe\" address the concept of duality while its rhythm is partly in the ska style. The Beatles rehearsed the song during the sessions for their Let It Be album in January 1969. Harrison subsequently taped a solo demo of the song, along with two other compositions that the band had overlooked: \"Something\" and \"All Things Must Pass\". The group formally recorded \"Old Brown Shoe\" in April, during the early sessions for Abbey Road.\nThe 1969 demo was released on the Beatles' Anthology 3 compilation in 1996. A concert version by Harrison was included on his 1992 album Live in Japan. Gary Brooker performed the song at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, held at London's Royal Albert Hall a year after Harrison's death.\nGeorge Harrison began writing \"Old Brown Shoe\" in late 1968 on a piano rather than guitar, his main instrument. The song's rhythm suggests the influence of ska. In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison says that the lyrical content started as a study in opposites and addresses \"the duality of things\". This idea was also prevalent in the Beatles' 1967 single \"Hello, Goodbye\", which Paul McCartney had written as an exercise in word association. For Harrison, the concept of duality also appealed on a philosophical level, consistent with his interest in Eastern religion. Neil Aspinall, the Beatles' assistant, later recalled Harrison employing the metaphysical theme of opposites to disperse some Hells Angels who had taken up residence in the Beatles' Apple headquarters over Christmas 1968 and refused to leave. According to theologian Dale Allison, \"Old Brown Shoe\" is a further reflection of Harrison's interest in \"dualities and contradictions\", but stated in terms that avoid the religiosity evident in much of his songwriting.\nBefore returning to England for Christmas, Harrison spent time with Bob Dylan and the Band in upstate New York. The visit allowed Harrison to experience a musical camaraderie that had been absent in the Beatles over much of 1968, and inspired him as he emerged as a prolific songwriter. Author and critic Ian MacDonald identifies the \"hood-eyed spirit\" of Dylan in the song's \"dusty shuffle-beat\" and ironic lyrics, while recognising the \"surprising and graphic\" chord progression as typical of Harrison's work. Author Alan Clayson also detects a Dylan influence in the rhythm, which he calls a \"'Highway 61 Revisited' chug\".\n\"Old Brown Shoe\" is in the key of C major, although its chords also suggest the latter's relative minor key, A minor. The time signature is 4/4 throughout. Following a four-bar introduction, the song's structure comprises two verses, a bridge, an instrumental verse, followed by a second bridge, a final verse and the outro.\nThe verse employs blues-inflected C7 and D7 chords (or I7 and II7 chords in Roman numeral analysis) before an increase in harmonic movement is marked by changes to F, A\u266d, F, E augmented and A minor. The verses avoid the expected plagal cadence by resolving with the relative minor chord rather than I7. In achieving this via the augmented chord, a C note resonates through the final changes, a device that musicologist Dominic Pedler cites among the Beatles' most effective uses of augmented chords. The bridge is structured in familiar 1960s rock fashion with its reliance on V and IV (G and F) chords. The section again resolves unusually, however; rather than using the expected D7 chord before exiting with a return to G, a disguised imperfect cadence is achieved through a dissonant iv\u266f diminished chord (F\u266fdim7) before the final V chord. Among other musicologists' assessments, Walter Everett considers that the composition's \"A/C duality\" fits well with Harrison's lyrical theme, while Alan Pollack highlights the flat VI (A\u266d) chord in the verse and the frequent bluesy flat 3rd and 7th notes alongside the I7 chords.\nMusic"

The song makes direct reference to fictional FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the two main characters of the popular sci-fi TV series The X-Files who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In an interview Cerys Matthews, co-writer of the song, explained that while she was not a serious fan of the show, the basic premise of the series matched the concept of what she was trying to express.\n\"Mulder and Scully\" was released as the second single from International Velvet on 19 January 1998. Originally, it was supposed to be the first single but was delayed due to circumstances beyond the band's control. The song was Catatonia's first single in the United States. \"Mulder and Scully\" became the group's break-out hit and received a mixed to positive response from the music press; many critics felt that, musically, the song was well played, but that the track's pop culture references were out of place.\nThe song reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, making it Catatonia's highest-charting UK song. It also became a hit in Iceland, reaching number two, and in Ireland, where it peaked at number 17. A music video was released that featured the band performing the track while Mulder and Scully, played by look-alikes, search the concert venue with torches.\nThe song makes direct reference to FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the two main characters of the popular sci-fi TV series The X-Files who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Although the title and refrain reference the popular show, the song has little to do with the two characters. Instead, the reference to Mulder and Scully is a metaphor for a relationship being so \"strange\" that it could be \"a case for Mulder and Scully\", a reference to the paranormal cases\u2014the titular X-Files\u2014the two investigate on the show. Cerys Matthews, the co-writer of the song, explained that the conceit of the song was \"about asking Mulder and Scully to figure out this thing called love. I like the idea of two people going round the planet investigating odd phenomena, in this case love\".\nMatthews later admitted that she was not a serious fan of the show, but that she only used the line because it adequately described the type of relationship she was singing about. In an interview with the Daily Record, she explained, \"I'm not a big fan of [The X-Files] but I got the line about things getting strange for Mulder and Scully from watching the odd episode\". After questioning, she later said that she would \"prefer to go out for a night on the town with Gazza and Chris Evans than meet [The X-Files] stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny\". Matthews also related that \"I'm sure loads of people bought the record by mistake, but who cares? They should be flattered we wrote a song about [The X-Files] anyway\".\nThe song was met with mixed to positive reviews from critics; many reviewers lauded the band's musical composition, but maligned the track for its heavy reliance on pop culture references.\nThe Sunday Mirror wrote positively of the song and called it \"hard rockin'\". Ben Myers from the now-defunct music magazine Melody Maker named the song the \"Single of the Week\" and called it \"fantastic\". He noted that \"they've damn near written a perfect pop song. The first best single of the year\". Jerry Rubino, host of the popular radio show \"Left of Center\", named the song one of his favorite \"Brit Things\". Sarah Zupko from PopMatters noted that the song was built around \"somewhat silly X-Files references\", but that it possessed \"hooks to die for\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the song a relatively positive review and singled it out as an \"AllMusic Pick\". He also praised the song's \"terrific [hook]\" but was slightly critical of the \"self-conscious pop culture references\". Despite this, he noted the band was successfully able to \"bring memorable melodies to the [song]\". A subsequent review by AllMusic awarded the single, by itself, two-and-a-half stars out of five. NME called the song \"little more than fodder for nostalgia TV\", written by a \"lazy television researcher's imagination\".\nCerys Matthews and the band were extremely pleased with the final product, calling it a \"better song\" than \"All Around the World\" by Oasis, the single's main competitor at the time. Matthews later said that the lyrics for \"Mulder and Scully\" were \"good,"

It was released on 3 September 2013 by Columbia Records as the first single from her eleventh English-language studio album of the same name (2013). The song was co-written by Sia, Hasham \"Sham\" Hussain and Denarius \"Motesart\" Motes, and produced by Sham and Motesart. The official live music video was uploaded on Vevo on 18 September 2013. \"Loved Me Back to Life\" received critical acclaim and became a top forty hit in various countries, including number fourteen in the United Kingdom, number seventeen in South Korea, number twenty-five in Switzerland and Belgium, number twenty-six in Canada, number twenty-nine in Ireland, number thirty-two in France and number thirty-eight in Germany and Austria.\n\"Loved Me Back to Life\" is a power ballad sung in a minor key, backed by a chorus that features a dubstep beat drop. It was co-written by Sia Furler who, among many achievements, provided vocals for David Guetta's \"Titanium\" and wrote the lyrics and melody for Rihanna's \"Diamonds\". The production duties were handled by  Hasham \"Sham\" Hussain and Denarius \"Motesart\" Motes, who are also responsible for \"Is Anybody Out There?\" by K'naan and Nelly Furtado. \"Loved Me Back to Life\" premiered on the radio on 3 September 2013 and was released as a digital download on the same day. The official audio for the single was then released onto Dion's Vevo channel. The song was sent to adult contemporary radio stations in the United States on 9 September 2013 and \"Loved Me Back to Life\" (BBC Radio 2 Mix) premiered on BBC Radio 2 in the United Kingdom on 28 September 2013. The making of \"Loved Me Back to Life\" was released on Vevo on 24 September 2013. The dance remixes were done by David Morales, Dave Aud\u00e9 and Jump Smokers, and were officially released in October 2013.\n\"Loved Me Back to Life\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Gary Graff of Billboard write that Dion has acknowledged modern pop trends with the lead single and title track from her first English-language album in six years. The \"stuttering\" vocal hook and dubstep beats are certainly of the moment, keeping pace with the Rihannas of the world, while Dion's own performance\u2014full and soaring, if a bit darker in tone than usual\u2014is characteristically \"\u00c2commanding\". Popjournalism praised the song and concluded: \"'Life' nicely sets up Dion's 5 Nov album release as a unit-selling single that hits the perfect mainstream sweet spot without alienating even her most milquetoast fan\". MTV's Brad Stern also praised and named it as one of five must-hear pop songs of the week: \"For her first English studio album in six years, Celine's leading with \"Loved Me Back to Life,\" a major power ballad penned by pop's most in-demand songwriter, Sia. It's a serious chills-inducing belter, packed full of emotion and crisp production. Welcome back, Celine, we missed you!\"  The Huffington Post was also positive, but little less by: \"a supremely modern track which sees the 45-year-old legend dipping into dubstep and even employing a bit of a hip-hop style beat. The song is nice, but it almost sounds like her soaring chorus is going to be followed up by some fiery Eminem verses over the skittering bass and drums\". Idolator editor Sam Lansky wrote a rave review: \"That stuttering vocal loop! The bombastic production! The funky instrumentation! The huge, surging chorus! The dubby beat drop on the refrain! The fact that it was written by Sia! The fact that it's new Celine Dion in the first place! It's all just marvellous. Unsurprisingly, the song has shades of Rihanna's \"Diamonds,\" but it feels markedly fresh and modern in its own right; as many divas have shown, staying relevant gets thornier when you\u2019re entering, y\u2019know, your fourth decade as an international superstar, but this is a solid effort from the Canadian chanteuse that should introduce her to some new fans as well as satisfying longtime supporters\".\nOK! compared: \"Her new song, in my opinion, is like Cher meets J.Lo and is a departure from \"My Heart Will Go On\" but I'm into it. You?\". Feedback Musiq praised a song: \"The studio cut sounds as powerful as she did live and is easily one of the best lyrical efforts by Sia. If six years has been too long for you, you\u2019re about to fall in love with Celine all over again as she gives you life with this new one\". DaysTune was surprised: \"I'm not sure"

She co-wrote the song with Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and  Ali Payami. Capitol Records first released it on July 14, 2016, as a standalone single, and Katy Perry\u2019s first single in almost two years. \"Rise\" is a mid-tempo electronic song with lyrical themes of victory and rising above one's opponents. After an Olympics-themed promotional video was released the following day, an official music video debuted on August 4, 2016.\nCommercially, the song reached number one in Australia, the top ten in the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Scotland, and Spain, the top twenty in Argentina, Canada, Lebanon, Switzerland, and the United States, and the top thirty in Austria, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\nNBC Sports announced upon the release of \"Rise\" that it would be prominently featured during its US television coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics. Perry stated that the track is \"a song that's brewing inside me for years, that has finally come to the surface\", and wanted to release it as a standalone track instead of including it on an album \"because now more than ever, there is a need for our world to unite\". Half of the song had previously been written prior to the Olympics, but was not completed because she felt \"it didn't come out right\". Perry further added:\nI can't think of a better example than the Olympic athletes, as they gather in Rio with their strength and fearlessness, to remind us how we ALL can come together, with the resolve to be the best we can be. I hope this song can inspire us to heal, unite, and rise together. I am honored that NBC Olympics has chosen to use ['Rise'] as an anthem before and during the Rio Games.\nNBC felt its message spoke \"directly to the spirit of the Olympics and its athletes\" for its inspirational themes. It was released as a single on July 14, 2016, for streaming on Apple Music and for download on iTunes.\nPerry co-wrote \"Rise\" with Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and  Ali Payami. It is a mid-tempo electronic song about victory and rising above opponents. Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic wrote the song is \"a languid anthem of determination that uses an echo machine and aggressive use of metaphor to evoke icons as diverse as Katniss Everdeen, Maya Angelou, and Jesus.\" BenI Ratliff of The New York Times called it a \"slow-footed\" song. In a review for Entertainment Weekly, Kevin O'Donell noted that the song \"starts with brooding atmospherics and minor-key synths before exploding into a huge chorus\".\nThe song is three minutes and twenty-three seconds long. It is written in the key of E\u266d minor with a common time tempo of 101.5 beats per minute. Perry's vocals span from C\u266f\u2084 to E\u266d\u2085 in the song.\nDaniel Kreps of Rolling Stone described the song as \"a galvanic sequel\" to \"Roar\". Marissa Payne from The Washington Post wrote: \"Sure, it's a bit of a slow jam, but the uplifting lyrics to 'Rise' are pretty solid.\" The song received a mixed response from The New York Times's journalists Jon Pareles, Ben Ratliff and Jon Caramanica who deemed the song \"limp\", writing they feel \"psyched\" and \"uneasy\". It received an average score of 5.7/10 from Idolator's critics. Kevin O'Donell of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a B+.\nChris Ingalls from Pop Matters described the song's nature as an \"emotional delivery\", and felt it worked nicely for the Olympics. Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent deemed it as \"power anthem mode\".\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Rise\" became Perry's 20th entry in the UK Singles Chart top 75, when it debuted and peaked at number 25 on the chart dated 22 July 2016, with first week sales of 22,497 copies. It became the 1055th number-one song in Australia, and the second song to debut atop the ARIA Singles Chart in 2016 following \"Pillowtalk\" by Zayn Malik. Perry's accumulated weeks at number-one atop the chart equaled to fourteen, placing her at fifth position on the list of artist with most number-ones in the 2010s. It also became her fourth number-one in the nation after \"I Kissed a Girl\", \"California Gurls\", and \"Roar\", and was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association for shipments of 35,000 units.\nIn the United States, \"Rise\" debuted and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, for the chart of August 6, 2016. It became Perry's 24th Hot 100 entry and her third-highest debut at the time behind \"Part of Me\" (number one) and \"California Gurls\" featuring Snoop Dogg (number two). It is also her first entry on the Hot 100 since 2014's \"This Is How We Do\"."

It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album Prism (2013) on October 16, 2013, two days before the album was released. Inspiration for the song came primarily from a humanitarian trip to Madagascar that Perry made in partnership with UNICEF. Having been surrounded by what she described as unconditional love, she co-wrote it with the song's producers Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Cirkut to reflect that feeling.\n\"Unconditionally\" is a power ballad styled in rock, backed against a bassline and percussion. Commercially, it peaked within the top ten in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Lebanon, and South Africa as well as the top twenty in Australia, Austria, Canada, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and the United States.\nThe single release was promoted with an Instagram-based campaign, a lyric video directed by Aya Tanimura and live performances\u2014one of the latter, at the American Music Awards of 2013, was the center of controversy due to accusations of cultural appropriation. Brent Benacorso served as the director for the track's music video, which adopts the theme of love and uses a series of metaphors to enrich its concept.\n\"Unconditionally\" was written by Perry alongside its producers Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Cirkut. Perry denoted the song as her favorite within the record. She also mentioned that she wrote the song bearing in mind the sentiments she had felt during her UNICEF humanitarian trip to Madagascar in April 2013. Such sentiments inspired her to delve into the theme of unconditional love. She stated that, while on that voyage, Perry and her team would \"go in cruisers up the mountain\" to see newly constructed schools. After observing a group of children, she realized that even without social networking, they felt \"pure\" unconditional love towards each other.\nInspired by that situation, the song was described by Perry as approaching all forms of love. \"I love this song because not only can it be a romantic, intimate song\", she expounded. \"But it can be about the type of love that a mother has when she sees her first child, or best friends [...] It is a transcendent love, not just relationship status.\" \"Unconditionally\" was also inspired by the acceptance of one's flaws in a relationship, which Perry believed was relatable to listeners. It was engineered by Peter Carlsson, Clint Gibbs, Sam Holland, and Michael Illbert, with assistance by Eric Eylands, Rachael Findlen, Justin Fox, and Cory Bice, at the MXM Studios in Stockholm, Sweden and Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Perry also handled vocal production. Engineering for mix was carried out by John Hanes and final mixing was helmed by Serban Ghenea at the MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\nAt a length of three minutes and forty-eight seconds (3:48), \"Unconditionally\" is a pop power ballad, which is styled in the genre of rock. According to the sheet music published by Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc. at Musicnotes.com, it is written in the key of G major. It paces at a moderately fast metronome, at approximately 129 beats per minute, while it is set at a 4/4 time signature, following a chord progression of Em\u2013C\u2013G\u2013D. Perry's vocals in the track span from G\u2083 to E\u2085. The track's \"uncluttered\" instrumentation features woodblock percussion and a \"dramatic\" bass line. Lyrically, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard deemed it the \"most mature offering\" on Prism, claiming it served as a \"predicate\" to Perry's 2010 single \"Teenage Dream\".\nIn September 2013, Perry teased the release of the song as the second single from Prism, without revealing its title or date. However, MTV concluded that such song was \"Unconditionally\", which she discussed during a listening party for the record. The release was confirmed by Billboard. The track debuted on October 16, 2013 and was serviced by Capitol Records to contemporary hit radio stations in the United States on October 22. The next day, it was sent to Australian radio stations. A CD single was released in Germany on November 22\u2014 the same date it was serviced to radios in Italy. In France, imports of the CD started being sold on December 3. A remix version of the song by Johnson Somerset was featured on a compilation album entitled Songs for the Philippines benefiting those affected by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.\nThe"

She co-wrote the song with Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and  Ali Payami. Capitol Records first released it on July 14, 2016, as a standalone single, and Katy Perry\u2019s first single in almost two years. \"Rise\" is a mid-tempo electronic song with lyrical themes of victory and rising above one's opponents. After an Olympics-themed promotional video was released the following day, an official music video debuted on August 4, 2016.\nCommercially, the song reached number one in Australia, the top ten in the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Scotland, and Spain, the top twenty in Argentina, Canada, Lebanon, Switzerland, and the United States, and the top thirty in Austria, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\nNBC Sports announced upon the release of \"Rise\" that it would be prominently featured during its US television coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics. Perry stated that the track is \"a song that's brewing inside me for years, that has finally come to the surface\", and wanted to release it as a standalone track instead of including it on an album \"because now more than ever, there is a need for our world to unite\". Half of the song had previously been written prior to the Olympics, but was not completed because she felt \"it didn't come out right\". Perry further added:\nI can't think of a better example than the Olympic athletes, as they gather in Rio with their strength and fearlessness, to remind us how we ALL can come together, with the resolve to be the best we can be. I hope this song can inspire us to heal, unite, and rise together. I am honored that NBC Olympics has chosen to use ['Rise'] as an anthem before and during the Rio Games.\nNBC felt its message spoke \"directly to the spirit of the Olympics and its athletes\" for its inspirational themes. It was released as a single on July 14, 2016, for streaming on Apple Music and for download on iTunes.\nPerry co-wrote \"Rise\" with Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and  Ali Payami. It is a mid-tempo electronic song about victory and rising above opponents. Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic wrote the song is \"a languid anthem of determination that uses an echo machine and aggressive use of metaphor to evoke icons as diverse as Katniss Everdeen, Maya Angelou, and Jesus.\" BenI Ratliff of The New York Times called it a \"slow-footed\" song.

It was first released on 7 October 1998 in Italy by Bliss Corporation and became internationally successful the following year. It is the lead single of their debut album Europop. The song is the group's most popular single, reaching number one in many countries' music charts, such as Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, New Zealand, Israel, Lebanon, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Australia, Austria, Greece, Germany, and Hungary, as well as reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in January 2000.\nIn the United Kingdom, the song initially entered the top 40 purely on import sales; it was only the third single to do this. The song also received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 2001 Grammy Awards, two years after it was released.\nWritten by Eiffel 65 lead singer Jeffrey Jey, keyboardist Maurizio Lobina, and producer Massimo Gabutti, \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" was inspired by Lobina's composed opening piano hook. The producers of the song then came up with the idea for a dance song. Jey explained that his inspiration for the lyrics was how a person chooses their lifestyle. The colour blue as the main theme of the song was picked at random, with Lobina telling him to write nonsensical lyrics. Gabutti came up with the \"da ba dee\" hook. The pitch-shifted vocal effect used in the song was created with a harmonizer.\n\"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" is written in the key of G minor, with the vocal range spanning from C\u2083 to E\u266d\u2084, and is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 128 beats per minute.\nThe song's lyrics tell a story about a man who lives in a \"blue world.\" It also explains that he is \"blue inside and outside,\" which, alongside the lyric \"himself and everybody around 'cause he ain't got nobody to listen,\" and \"blue are the feelings that live inside me\" may indicate that the term blue represents his emotional state; however, the song also explains that a vast variety of what he owns is also blue, including his house and his car (\"a blue Corvette\"): different blue-coloured objects are also depicted on the single's cover. The song's hook is the sentence \"I'm blue,\" followed by a repetition of the sounds \"da ba dee da ba die\", which the hook is based around.\nThe song received mixed reviews from critics. Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that \"the hook here, with its dancy but curiously compelling singsongy rhythm and lyric, is destined to react instantly with listeners far and wide.\" He also noted that it has a \"euro sound\", and \"it's creative, it will affect listeners on both ends of the demographic spectrum, and it's anthemic.\" Entertainment Weekly positively reviewed the song, calling the song \"a fleeting, feel-good foot-tapper\" and gave the song a rating of B-. Daily Record said it is the \"strangest-sounding Euro-club hit of the summer\". The Daily Vault's Christopher Thelen described it as a \"quirky little hit\" with a \"bouncy chorus\". He also noted that \"the key is the use of the voice synthesizer\". PopMatters reviewer Chris Massey, in his review of Europop, described his initial reaction to the song as being \"really, really bad.\" However, he later stated in the review that after many repeated listenings of the song he \"loved it.\" AllMusic editor Jose F. Promis described the song as a \"hypnotic smash\" in his review of Europop.\nRolling Stone, however, in their review of Europop, gave the song a negative review, commenting that the song \"blends Cher-esque vocoder vocals, trance-like synth riffs, unabashed Eurodisco beats and a baby-babble chorus so infantile it makes the Teletubbies sound like Shakespeare.\" The magazine also placed the song on their list of the \"20 Most Annoying Songs,\" at No. 14.\nThe single, released in October 1998, was a chart-topper in many European countries. The song initially found success in France, where it debuted in August 1999 and reached number one for three weeks. It then found success in other European countries, reaching the top spot on many charts in September the same year, including Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and many other countries. It replaced \"Mambo No. 5\" by Lou Bega on many of these charts at the top spot. In the United Kingdom, the song spent three weeks at the top of the singles chart in September and"

It was produced by Butch Walker, and released on January 12, 2009, as the album's third single. \"Thinking of You\" deals with a break-up in which Perry does not want to move on but has no choice, and feels nostalgic of a previous lover while in a relationship with another man.\nThe song peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the album's only single to fail to reach the Top 10 in the United States, and peaked at number 27 in the United Kingdom. There are two music videos released for the song. The first was released in 2007 and features Perry in two different rooms\u2014black and white\u2014and was directed by a friend of hers. The second was the commercial release in 2009, which is set in the 1940s and features Perry playing a woman who lost her lover, a soldier (played by Matt Dallas), in battle during World War II. Perry began playing the song during gigs as early as 2006, and performed the song on all of her concert tours: the Hello Katy Tour, the California Dreams Tour, the Prismatic World Tour and Witness: The Tour. In South America, the song was included in the international soundtrack of Brazilian soap opera India, a Love Story and became very successful.\n\"Thinking of You\" was written by Perry in 2002 and produced by Butch Walker. Amateur video of Perry performing an entirely acoustic version at the Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Los Angeles as early as 2006 is available on YouTube. The single was released on January 12, 2009, in the US, and in Australia a week later.\nAccording to digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony-ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of E major and the tempo moves at 76 beats per minute. Perry's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of G\u266f\u2083 to the higher note of C\u2085. According to Perry, the lyrics of the song are about a break-up after which she doesn't want to move on but has no choice, and is thinking about her ex-boyfriend while she is with her current lover. Perry describes her former lover as \"perfection\" and feels disgusted with herself when she kisses her current boyfriend, calling him second best in comparison.\nWriting for BBC Music, Lizzie Ennever exalted her vocal performance while commenting that the song possesses \"edge\" and \"rawness\" that, according to Ennever, are characteristic of the \"real [Perry]\". David Balls from Digital Spy described the track as a \"serious offering designed to show off her vocal and songwriting talents\", and compared it to the catalogues of Alanis Morissette and band Evanescence. Giving it three stars out of five, he wrote: \"So does she succeed? Well, certainly not for want of trying.\" In a less positive review, Nicole Frehsee from Rolling Stone dismissed the song as \"generic Dawson's Creek schlock\".\nJon Caramanica of The New York Times favored the song's production, stating that Perry works better with melody and emotion. He contrasted the song\u2014which he described as \"gently and compellingly angry\"\u2014with Perry's singles of sexual themes, and concluded that \"feeling deeply is shocking enough\". For Contactmusic.com, Kelda Manley called the song \"high quality\" whereas NME reviewer Alex Miller jokingly regarded it as having \"all the emotional subtlety of a flamethrower\". A writer for The Boston Globe found similarities to Alanis Morissette's musicality in the track, such as her \"sour melodicism\" and vocals. Reviewing the single for Billboard, editor CT praised Perry for her \"distinct vocal inflection\". Another writer of Capital described it as \"cracking\" and \"single material\".\nIn the United States, \"Thinking of You\" attained moderate success. The song debuted on the US Billboard component chart Bubbling Under Hot 100 at number 5. Three weeks later, it entered the primary Hot 100 chart at number 79; having climbed to number 50 in the following week. It rose fifteen spots one week after, giving the track the title of \"Greatest Digital Gainer\" for that chart issue. The following week, it reached a peak of number 29, where it stayed for more two weeks. By the seventh week spent on the chart, the song moved to number 31; from there on, it started plummeting down the chart. Following a chart progression of 34\u2013 44\u2013 51\u2013 55\u2013 67\u2013 68\u2013 84, it left the chart at number 91 on the May 9 chart issue. \"Thinking of You\" has sold 1.1 million copies in the United States as of January 2015.\nInternationally, commercial outcomes for"

She co-wrote the song with Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and  Ali Payami. Capitol Records first released it on July 14, 2016, as a standalone single, and Katy Perry\u2019s first single in almost two years. \"Rise\" is a mid-tempo electronic song with lyrical themes of victory and rising above one's opponents. After an Olympics-themed promotional video was released the following day, an official music video debuted on August 4, 2016.\nCommercially, the song reached number one in Australia, the top ten in the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Scotland, and Spain, the top twenty in Argentina, Canada, Lebanon, Switzerland, and the United States, and the top thirty in Austria, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\nNBC Sports announced upon the release of \"Rise\" that it would be prominently featured during its US television coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics. Perry stated that the track is \"a song that's brewing inside me for years, that has finally come to the surface\", and wanted to release it as a standalone track instead of including it on an album \"because now more than ever, there is a need for our world to unite\". Half of the song had previously been written prior to the Olympics, but was not completed because she felt \"it didn't come out right\". Perry further added:\nI can't think of a better example than the Olympic athletes, as they gather in Rio with their strength and fearlessness, to remind us how we ALL can come together, with the resolve to be the best we can be. I hope this song can inspire us to heal, unite, and rise together. I am honored that NBC Olympics has chosen to use ['Rise'] as an anthem before and during the Rio Games.\nNBC felt its message spoke \"directly to the spirit of the Olympics and its athletes\" for its inspirational themes. It was released as a single on July 14, 2016, for streaming on Apple Music and for download on iTunes.\nPerry co-wrote \"Rise\" with Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and  Ali Payami. It is a mid-tempo electronic song about victory and rising above opponents. Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic wrote the song is \"a languid anthem of determination that uses an echo machine and aggressive use of metaphor to evoke icons as diverse as Katniss Everdeen, Maya Angelou, and Jesus.\" BenI Ratliff of The New York Times called it a \"slow-footed\" song. In a review for Entertainment Weekly, Kevin O'Donell noted that the song \"starts with brooding atmospherics and minor-key synths before exploding into a huge chorus\".\nThe song is three minutes and twenty-three seconds long. It is written in the key of E\u266d minor with a common time tempo of 101.5 beats per minute. Perry's vocals span from C\u266f\u2084 to E\u266d\u2085 in the song.\nDaniel Kreps of Rolling Stone described the song as \"a galvanic sequel\" to \"Roar\". Marissa Payne from The Washington Post wrote: \"Sure, it's a bit of a slow jam, but the uplifting lyrics to 'Rise' are pretty solid.\" The song received a mixed response from The New York Times's journalists Jon Pareles, Ben Ratliff and Jon Caramanica who deemed the song \"limp\", writing they feel \"psyched\" and \"uneasy\". It received an average score of 5.7/10 from Idolator's critics. Kevin O'Donell of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a B+.\nChris Ingalls from Pop Matters described the song's nature as an \"emotional delivery\", and felt it worked nicely for the Olympics. Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent deemed it as \"power anthem mode\".\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Rise\" became Perry's 20th entry in the UK Singles Chart top 75, when it debuted and peaked at number 25 on the chart dated 22 July 2016, with first week sales of 22,497 copies. It became the 1055th number-one song in Australia, and the second song to debut atop the ARIA Singles Chart in 2016 following \"Pillowtalk\" by Zayn Malik. Perry's accumulated weeks at number-one atop the chart equaled to fourteen, placing her at fifth position on the list of artist with most number-ones in the 2010s. It also became her fourth number-one in the nation after \"I Kissed a Girl\", \"California Gurls\", and \"Roar\", and was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association for shipments of 35,000 units.\nIn the United States, \"Rise\" debuted and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, for the chart of August 6, 2016. It became Perry's 24th Hot 100 entry and her third-highest debut at the time behind \"Part of Me\" (number one) and \"California Gurls\" featuring Snoop Dogg (number two).

It was written by American musician Prince using the pseudonym \"Christopher\" and was originally intended for the group Apollonia 6 in 1984. Lyrically, it describes a woman who is waking up to go to work on Monday, wishing it was still Sunday so she could continue relaxing.\nThe single, released by Columbia Records on Monday, January 27, 1986, received generally positive reviews from music critics and some comparisons with the Mamas & the Papas' \"Monday, Monday\". It became the Bangles' first hit, reaching No. 2 in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as in Austria, Canada, Germany, and Ireland, and peaked within the Top 5 in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland. It was later certified silver in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\nPrince wrote \"Manic Monday\" in 1984, and recorded it as a duet for the band Apollonia 6's self-titled album; however, he eventually pulled the song. Two years later, he offered the single to the Bangles under the pseudonym \"Christopher\", a character he played in the 1986 film Under the Cherry Moon. It was rumored by various writers that after Prince listened to the band's 1984 debut album All Over the Place, he gave the song to Bangles rhythm guitarist Susanna Hoffs, in hopes of winning her affection. Prince's original demo recording of the song would not be released until it appeared on the 2019 demo compilation Originals.\nIn an interview with MTV UK in 1989 Debbi Peterson explained why Prince gave them the song: \"[Prince] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher.\" Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: \"It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it.\"\nA pop song written in D major, \"Manic Monday\" moves at a tempo of 116 beats per minute and is set in common time. The song has a sequence of D\u2013A\u2087\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2087\u2013G as its chord progression. Lyrically, the song is about someone waking up from a romantic dream at six o'clock on Monday morning, and facing a hectic journey to work when she would prefer to still be enjoying relaxing on Sunday\u2014her \"I-don't-have-to-run day\". Actor Rudolph Valentino is referred in the first verse.\n\nSome critics compared the song with the single \"Monday, Monday\" by the band the Mamas & the Papas. In a review for AllMusic, Mark Deming said that the single \"was a far cry from anything the Bangles had recorded before\"; while Matthew Greenwald, also from the website, said\nIt's a clever and deceptively simple pop narrative, an infectious pop confection ... There is also an excellently written bridge that shows Prince/Christopher to be an excellent craftsman, and, to their credit, the Bangles carry it off with style and wit?\nRobert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times called the song \"a candidate for best single of the year\". The Guardian music critic Dorian Lynskey commented about the painful rhyming of \"Sunday\" with \"I-don't-have-to-run day.\"\nMark Moses from The Phoenix said \"the lack of lyrical substance is so glaring that Prince's lame 'Manic Monday' seems like a thematic highlight\". Greg Baker of The Miami News wrote in the album's review that \"the song should put the Bangles on the 'pop 'n' roll' map\". A writer in Toledo Blade noted that \"Manic Monday\" was \"infectious\" and,"

Co-written with and produced by Sam Watters and Louis Biancaniello, the song was released as the album's second single. It was also the only single released in the United States from the album, peaking at number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.\n\"One Day In Your Life\" was written by Anastacia and co-written with and produced by Sam Watters and Louis Biancaniello. It is a  soulful disco song. It also features a funk synthesizer.\nJose F. Promis written for Allmusic called it \"dramatic\" and said that \"it follows the same formula as her previous hit, 'I'm Outta Love,' but better, with more soaring, epic vocals, and sounds like a rock version of a forgotten disco classic.\" Mark Bautz from Entertainment Weekly commented that \"it has a kicky Flashdance retro vibe.\" Aidin Vaziri from Rolling Stone called it \"a moment of sheer overkill.\"\nThough \"One Day in Your Life\" never charted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, it earned Anastacia her first chart-topper on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart, staying atop for one week. The single fared far better elsewhere, charting within the top ten in Australia and several European countries, including Austria, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, while peaking at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart.\nAnastacia performed \"One Day in Your Life\" at several live events such as the Edison Awards on February 27, 2002 (where she won the award for Best International Female), VH1's Divas Las Vegas on May 23, 2002, the Royal Variety Performance on December 2, 2002, and the Life Ball on May 20, 2006, as well as on television shows like Live with Regis and Kelly in the United States, Top of the Pops in the United Kingdom, Wetten, dass..? in Germany, and Rove Live in Australia. In addition, she performed the song on her 2004\u201305 Live at Last Tour (although it was not included on the Live at Last DVD) and on her 2009 Heavy Rotation Tour.\nBeing her first music video directed by Dave Meyers, who has also directed videos for Janet Jackson, Britney Spears, Pink, and Bow Wow, the video was shot on January 16\u201317, 2002 in Los Angeles and Santa Monica, California. In the beginning, while the sun is rising up, Anastacia is shown eating a bowl of cereal for breakfast, while singing the first verse of the song. After the slow opening, she dances through the room and you see other people in a sort of a game house. The video shows men playing volleyball on the beach and other people swimming in the pool. Then Anastacia is seen lying on a pool side with braids wearing a bikini. When the second chorus breaks, an old man sprinkles her wet using his hose. Next, the camera travels through a sand castle. When it gets out of the castle, Anastacia is seen dancing while behind her people are skateboarding on a ramp. An alternate version of the video also exists, which was released in the United States. This version of the video mainly contains footage from the regular video featuring some new scenes, from the same video shoot.

She co-wrote the song with Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and  Ali Payami. Capitol Records first released it on July 14, 2016, as a standalone single, and Katy Perry\u2019s first single in almost two years. \"Rise\" is a mid-tempo electronic song with lyrical themes of victory and rising above one's opponents. After an Olympics-themed promotional video was released the following day, an official music video debuted on August 4, 2016.\nCommercially, the song reached number one in Australia, the top ten in the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Scotland, and Spain, the top twenty in Argentina, Canada, Lebanon, Switzerland, and the United States, and the top thirty in Austria, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\nNBC Sports announced upon the release of \"Rise\" that it would be prominently featured during its US television coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics. Perry stated that the track is \"a song that's brewing inside me for years, that has finally come to the surface\", and wanted to release it as a standalone track instead of including it on an album \"because now more than ever, there is a need for our world to unite\". Half of the song had previously been written prior to the Olympics, but was not completed because she felt \"it didn't come out right\". Perry further added:\nI can't think of a better example than the Olympic athletes, as they gather in Rio with their strength and fearlessness, to remind us how we ALL can come together, with the resolve to be the best we can be. I hope this song can inspire us to heal, unite, and rise together. I am honored that NBC Olympics has chosen to use ['Rise'] as an anthem before and during the Rio Games.\nNBC felt its message spoke \"directly to the spirit of the Olympics and its athletes\" for its inspirational themes. It was released as a single on July 14, 2016, for streaming on Apple Music and for download on iTunes.\nPerry co-wrote \"Rise\" with Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and  Ali Payami. It is a mid-tempo electronic song about victory and rising above opponents. Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic wrote the song is \"a languid anthem of determination that uses an echo machine and aggressive use of metaphor to evoke icons as diverse as Katniss Everdeen, Maya Angelou, and Jesus.\" BenI Ratliff of The New York Times called it a \"slow-footed\" song. In a review for Entertainment Weekly, Kevin O'Donell noted that the song \"starts with brooding atmospherics and minor-key synths before exploding into a huge chorus\".\nThe song is three minutes and twenty-three seconds long. It is written in the key of E\u266d minor with a common time tempo of 101.5 beats per minute. Perry's vocals span from C\u266f\u2084 to E\u266d\u2085 in the song.\nDaniel Kreps of Rolling Stone described the song as \"a galvanic sequel\" to \"Roar\". Marissa Payne from The Washington Post wrote: \"Sure, it's a bit of a slow jam, but the uplifting lyrics to 'Rise' are pretty solid.\" The song received a mixed response from The New York Times's journalists Jon Pareles, Ben Ratliff and Jon Caramanica who deemed the song \"limp\", writing they feel \"psyched\" and \"uneasy\". It received an average score of 5.7/10 from Idolator's critics. Kevin O'Donell of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a B+.\nChris Ingalls from Pop Matters described the song's nature as an \"emotional delivery\", and felt it worked nicely for the Olympics. Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent deemed it as \"power anthem mode\".\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Rise\" became Perry's 20th entry in the UK Singles Chart top 75, when it debuted and peaked at number 25 on the chart dated 22 July 2016, with first week sales of 22,497 copies. It became the 1055th number-one song in Australia, and the second song to debut atop the ARIA Singles Chart in 2016 following \"Pillowtalk\" by Zayn Malik. Perry's accumulated weeks at number-one atop the chart equaled to fourteen, placing her at fifth position on the list of artist with most number-ones in the 2010s. It also became her fourth number-one in the nation after \"I Kissed a Girl\", \"California Gurls\", and \"Roar\", and was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association for shipments of 35,000 units.\nIn the United States, \"Rise\" debuted and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, for the chart of August 6, 2016. It became Perry's 24th Hot 100 entry and her third-highest debut at the time behind \"Part of Me\" (number one) and \"California Gurls\" featuring Snoop Dogg (number two). It is also her first entry on the Hot 100 since 2014's \"This Is How We Do\"."

The song was written by Lavigne, David Hodges, Chad Kroeger, Jacob Kasher, and its producer Martin Johnson. It was released as the lead single from the album on April 9, 2013, by Epic Records. \"Here's To Never Growing Up\" is a midtempo pop rock song that talks about a \"celebration of being forever young\" and features a reference to English alternative rock band Radiohead.\nMusic critics provided mixed reviews to \"Here's To Never Growing Up\" and drew comparisons between the song and songs by Lavigne's contemporaries Katy Perry, Kesha, and Taylor Swift. The single was an international success, reaching number one on the Taiwan and Philippines charts, while reaching the top ten in Belgium, China, Ireland, Japan, Russia, Scotland, South Korea, South Africa and Ukraine, also reaching the top twenty in Australia, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States despite the lack of initial exposure. It achieved certifications by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) due to the chart success.\nAn accompanying music video for \"Here's To Never Growing Up\" was directed by Robert Hales. It features Lavigne and her band performing at the school's prom, and resembles to the music video for her 2002 single \"Complicated\". The video gained positive feedback from critics, who praised Lavigne's look in the clip. Due to the song's success, Lavigne performed \"Here's To Never Growing Up\" on a number of shows, including Dancing with the Stars, Today and The Voice UK. The song is playable in the video game Guitar Hero Live.\n\"Here's To Never Growing Up\" was written by Lavigne, David Hodges, Chad Kroeger, Jacob Kasher, and producer of the song Martin Johnson. The song was recorded in early 2013 at Henson Recording Studios. During an interview with Ryan Seacrest for 102.7 KIIS-FM show, Lavigne said, \"I wanted to write something fun and summery. It's about being young, wanting to be young forever, living in the moment and having a blast\". Talking about the song's conception to 4Music, Lavigne revealed that she missed her high school prom so much, and that was the reason why she wrote \"Here's To Never Growing Up\". She said, \"When I was writing it, I was thinking about being younger \u2013 I\u2019m still in my 20s, but you know, like high school \u2013 and with my 20s being in music and everything, I love the concept of 'simply prom' for the video\". Lavigne announced the song would be released as the first single from her fifth studio album on 8 February 2013 via Twitter. Lavigne later revealed the single's official artwork as well as its release date via Twitter on April 3, 2013. Epic Records premiered \"Here's to Never Growing Up\" on On Air with Ryan Seacrest (KIIS-FM) radio show, on iTunes Stores and eventually sent the single to US contemporary hit radio station on April 9, 2013.\n\"Here's To Never Growing Up\" is a midtempo pop rock song, with a moderate tempo of 82 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F major. Lavigne's vocal range in the track spans from the low-note of A\u2083 to the high-note of C\u2085. The \"punchy\" song is built around a \"big, kick-drum\" stomp, acoustic-guitar-strumming, and simple-minded tunes. Digital Spy editor Robert Cospey wrote the song has a \"pumping guitars 'n drums melody\". Melinda Newman from HitFix thought that \"Here's to Never Growing Up\" is a \"throwback\" to Kesha's \"Tik Tok\" (2009) and Lavigne's \"Girlfriend\" (2007) for the same musical structure.\nLyrically, the song talks about a \"celebration of being forever young\". In the song, Lavigne sings about the things she's going to do that she believes will keep her forever young, such as getting drunk and dancing on a bar, running down the street screaming profanities, blasting music and staying up all night. At the beginning, Lavigne sings \"Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs\", referencing the rock band Radiohead, which is also featured in the chorus. At the chorus, she continues \"We'll be running down the street yelling kiss my ass\", followed by an \"ear-snagging chant\" of \"oh-woah-oh\". Lavigne declares her celebration at the second verse, \"This is who we are/ I don't think we'll ever change/ They say 'Just grow up,' but they don't know us/ We don't give a fuck!\".\n\n\"Here's To Never Growing Up\" received mixed reviews from contemporary critics.

It was written by American musician Prince using the pseudonym \"Christopher\" and was originally intended for the group Apollonia 6 in 1984. Lyrically, it describes a woman who is waking up to go to work on Monday, wishing it was still Sunday so she could continue relaxing.\nThe single, released by Columbia Records on Monday, January 27, 1986, received generally positive reviews from music critics and some comparisons with the Mamas & the Papas' \"Monday, Monday\". It became the Bangles' first hit, reaching No. 2 in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as in Austria, Canada, Germany, and Ireland, and peaked within the Top 5 in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland. It was later certified silver in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\nPrince wrote \"Manic Monday\" in 1984, and recorded it as a duet for the band Apollonia 6's self-titled album; however, he eventually pulled the song. Two years later, he offered the single to the Bangles under the pseudonym \"Christopher\", a character he played in the 1986 film Under the Cherry Moon. It was rumored by various writers that after Prince listened to the band's 1984 debut album All Over the Place, he gave the song to Bangles rhythm guitarist Susanna Hoffs, in hopes of winning her affection. Prince's original demo recording of the song would not be released until it appeared on the 2019 demo compilation Originals.\nIn an interview with MTV UK in 1989 Debbi Peterson explained why Prince gave them the song: \"[Prince] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher.\" Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: \"It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it.\"\nA pop song written in D major, \"Manic Monday\" moves at a tempo of 116 beats per minute and is set in common time. The song has a sequence of D\u2013A\u2087\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2087\u2013G as its chord progression. Lyrically, the song is about someone waking up from a romantic dream at six o'clock on Monday morning, and facing a hectic journey to work when she would prefer to still be enjoying relaxing on Sunday\u2014her \"I-don't-have-to-run day\". Actor Rudolph Valentino is referred in the first verse.\n\nSome critics compared the song with the single \"Monday, Monday\" by the band the Mamas & the Papas. In a review for AllMusic, Mark Deming said that the single \"was a far cry from anything the Bangles had recorded before\"; while Matthew Greenwald, also from the website, said\nIt's a clever and deceptively simple pop narrative, an infectious pop confection ... There is also an excellently written bridge that shows Prince/Christopher to be an excellent craftsman, and, to their credit, the Bangles carry it off with style and wit?\nRobert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times called the song \"a candidate for best single of the year\". The Guardian music critic Dorian Lynskey commented about the painful rhyming of \"Sunday\" with \"I-don't-have-to-run day.\"\nMark Moses from The Phoenix said \"the lack of lyrical substance is so glaring that Prince's lame 'Manic Monday' seems like a thematic highlight\". Greg Baker of The Miami News wrote in the album's review that \"the song should put the Bangles on the 'pop 'n' roll' map\". A writer in Toledo Blade noted that \"Manic Monday\" was \"infectious\" and,"

It was written by Lavigne and the Matrix (Scott Spock, Lauren Christy, and Graham Edwards), and produced by the Matrix. The single peaked at number one in Australia (for six weeks), New Zealand and Mexico (for nine weeks), number two on the Billboard Hot 100, behind Nelly's \"Hot in Herre\" and \"Dilemma\" featuring Kelly Rowland and number three in the United Kingdom. Based on its chart performance, the song is Lavigne's second most successful single (only behind her 2007 single \"Girlfriend\") and was one of the most successful releases of 2002 with sales of over 3 million copies sold worldwide. Lavigne broke a record set by Natalie Imbruglia's \"Torn\" when \"Complicated\" held the number one spot on the Adult Top 40 chart for 16 weeks in a row. \"Complicated\" was the fourth-most played song on radio in Canada in 2002, and the most played song of the year by a Canadian artist. \"Complicated\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\nAfter being signed to Arista Records in November 2000 upon the authorization of the label's CEO, Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, Lavigne moved to New York with the assistance of Reid. There, she began working on her debut album, Let Go, collaborating with a host of prime songwriters and producers. For six months, the label set up Lavigne with two co-writers, who worked with her upon Arista's instructions. Reid expected Lavigne to record folk songs because she auditioned to them in a \"balladic, 'new country'\" type. However, the collective failed to click \"with a girl who'd just discovered guitar-based rock\". For a year, nothing was working for Lavigne and was on the verge of getting dropped off Arista. The management pitched her songs written by other songwriters, but she declined, insisting she wanted to write songs herself. Lavigne relocated to Los Angeles, where she collaborated with songwriter-producer Clif Magness, who gave her ample creative control in the writing process. Lavigne and Magness wrote \"Losing Grip\" and \"Unwanted\", songs that she deemed reflective of her vision for the entire album. However, Arista was not thrilled with the heavy-guitar laden songs that Lavigne was writing, prompting the label to look for other producers to match their demands.\nTwo years since she signed the deal, Lavigne came to the attention of the three-piece production team the Matrix. Arista could not find the right direction for Lavigne, so the team's manager, Sandy Roberton, suggested that they work together. According to member Lauren Christy, they had been listening to Lavigne's early songs and felt they contained \"a Faith Hill kind of vibe\". As soon as they saw Lavigne coming into their studio, the Matrix felt that her musical direction was incongruous to her image and attitude. After talking to Lavigne for an hour, the singer said she wanted songs with punk rock inclinations. They told her to come back the following day, and in the afternoon during that day, they wrote a song that evolved into \"Complicated\" and another song called \"Falling Down\". They played it to Lavigne when she came back the following day, inspiring her what path she should take.\nWhen Josh Sarubin, the A&R executive who signed Lavigne to the imprint, heard the song, he knew it was right for her. Lavigne presented the song to Reid, who agreed the musical direction Lavigne and the Matrix were taking, and set \"Complicated\" as the album's lead single.\nComposed in the key of F major, \"Complicated\" is a pop rock song about how people can feign or pretend in front of others. Lavigne said about the song: \"People sometimes bother me how they're not real and how they're just, like, putting on a face and being two-faced\". Lavigne stated that she experienced this with both boyfriends and female friends.\n\nThe song received generally positive reviews from critics.  In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted \"Complicated\" as the eighth Top single of the decade. \"Complicated\" also ranked at #197 in Blender magazine's \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\".  In an AOL Radio listener's poll, \"Complicated\" was voted Lavigne's sixth best song.\nDavid Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a B- and said \"Avril Lavigne's not kidding about that title, she's the epitome of the blossoming anti-Britney movement\".

The single was an international success, reaching number one on the Taiwan and Philippines charts, while reaching the top ten in Belgium, China, Ireland, Japan, Russia, Scotland, South Korea, South Africa and Ukraine, also reaching the top twenty in Australia, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States despite the lack of initial exposure. It achieved certifications by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) due to the chart success.\nAn accompanying music video for \"Here's To Never Growing Up\" was directed by Robert Hales. It features Lavigne and her band performing at the school's prom, and resembles to the music video for her 2002 single \"Complicated\". The video gained positive feedback from critics, who praised Lavigne's look in the clip. Due to the song's success, Lavigne performed \"Here's To Never Growing Up\" on a number of shows, including Dancing with the Stars, Today and The Voice UK. The song is playable in the video game Guitar Hero Live.\n\"Here's To Never Growing Up\" was written by Lavigne, David Hodges, Chad Kroeger, Jacob Kasher, and producer of the song Martin Johnson. The song was recorded in early 2013 at Henson Recording Studios. During an interview with Ryan Seacrest for 102.7 KIIS-FM show, Lavigne said, \"I wanted to write something fun and summery. It's about being young, wanting to be young forever, living in the moment and having a blast\". Talking about the song's conception to 4Music, Lavigne revealed that she missed her high school prom so much, and that was the reason why she wrote \"Here's To Never Growing Up\". She said, \"When I was writing it, I was thinking about being younger \u2013 I\u2019m still in my 20s, but you know, like high school \u2013 and with my 20s being in music and everything, I love the concept of 'simply prom' for the video\". Lavigne announced the song would be released as the first single from her fifth studio album on 8 February 2013 via Twitter. Lavigne later revealed the single's official artwork as well as its release date via Twitter on April 3, 2013.

It is composed in the key of F major. Lavigne's vocal range in the track spans from the low-note of A\u2083 to the high-note of C\u2085.

Digital Spy editor Robert Cospey wrote the song has a \"pumping guitars 'n drums melody\".

In the song, Lavigne sings about the things she's going to do that she believes will keep her forever young, such as getting drunk and dancing on a bar, running down the street screaming profanities, blasting music and staying up all night.

In 2021, Anaconda became first music video for a solo female rap song to hit 1 billion views.  To further promote the song, Minaj performed it live at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and also performed it at Fashion Rocks and the iHeartRadio Music Festival. \"Anaconda\" was nominated for Best Rap Song at the 2015 Grammy Awards. The song was also nominated for two categories at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, Best Female Video and Best Hip-Hop Video, winning the latter.\nOn August 5, 2014, producer Polow da Don claimed the \"Anaconda\" instrumental was originally intended for rapper and musician Missy Elliott, but was scrapped and then re-recorded by Minaj. However, on August 24, 2014, Elliott revealed to fans and followers via her Twitter account that Polow's recollections were untrue and additionally confirmed that she never received the alleged instrumental. The cover art for the single went viral on the web after being revealed. On various digital music stores, the cover art is censored with the Parental Advisory label over Minaj's buttocks. The song heavily samples \"Baby Got Back\" by Sir Mix-a-Lot, who also has vocals in the chorus of the song.\nThe song has been viewed by some as a diss track, in answer to \"Baby Got Back\". Whereas Sir Mix-a-Lot focuses on a woman's body and the pleasure it gives him, Minaj raps from the perspective of the unnamed woman, and shows how she uses her body to profit and empower herself.\nAccording to Minaj's sound engineer Aubry \"Big Juice\" Delaine, \"Anaconda\" had 27 different versions at first. Production team Da Internz were then brought in to add drums to the song, whereafter it was sent for mixing and mastering, which made it \"perfect\".\nMusically, the song is a hip hop and pop-rap song. The song is written in the key of C\u266f minor with a tempo of 130 beats per minute.\nCarolyn Menyes from Music Times said it is a bit \"raunchy\" though this was \"expected\" and saying \"Anaconda\" continues Minaj's promise to move away from her poppier singles such as \"Super Bass\" and \"Starships\", and go back to her hardcore rap roots. Kory Grow from Rolling Stone praised the use of the \"Baby Got Back\" sample and said the song stayed true to the theme of the original. Kevin Goddard from HotNewHipHop said \"Nicki's raunchy new version may be the next big thing to hit the industry.\" Dan Reilly from Spin said \"Minaj takes the good Sir's '92 ode to protruding posteriors and adds a heavy dose of 2014 sex lingo.\" Amy Davidson from Digital Spy gave the song three stars out of five and said that \"Nicki's breaking down barriers.\"\nSir Mix-a-Lot said he had, \"a whole new level of respect for Minaj\" after hearing the record and that he became a \"fan for life\" of Minaj.\nThe song made Spin's end of year 'The 101 Best Songs of 2014' list. It ranked #3 on the list of 101 entries and Spin herald it \"much more than just a song\" but a \"cultural movement.\" She was the only rapper to make the top ten of the list as a lead artist. \"Anaconda\" was also placed at number two on MTV's Best Songs of 2014.\nHowever, despite the positive reviews the song received negative reactions. The London Economic called it \"one of the worst songs ever.\" Critics from National Review referred to the song as \"degrading,\" adding that it promoted prostitution, drug abuse and immorality to young girls. A city in Israel banned the song and prohibited"

It was written by Minaj and produced by Jeremy Reid. Commercially, the song peaked at number 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100, reached the top 20 in Canada, and the top 30 in France and the United Kingdom. It won the award for Best Hip-Hop Video at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.\nIn March 2017, Minaj released a three-single pack that included \"Changed It\" with Lil Wayne, \"No Frauds\" with Drake and Wayne, and \"Regret in Your Tears\", intended as lead singles for Queen but eventually did not make the final cut. On April 10, 2018, Minaj announced on Instagram that she will be releasing two new songs: \"Barbie Tingz\" and \"Chun-Li\" on April 12, and also posted cover artworks of the respective singles. \"Chun-Li\", which takes its name from the Street Fighter character of the same name, was released alongside the buzz single \"Barbie Tingz\" as a part of Minaj's upcoming fourth studio album Queen (2018) and made available for streaming and digital download on April 12 by Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records. The release of songs landed on the 10th anniversary of Minaj's second mixtape, Sucka Free (2008). On May 30, Minaj posted a video showing the making of the song, in preview of her upcoming documentary about the making of Queen set to air on HBO Max in 2021.\n\"Chun-Li\" was produced by Atlanta-native producer J. Reid for Chevi Muzic, alongside Minaj who was credited as a coproducer. According to him, Minaj wanted to deliver the type of \"boom-bap\" flavored beats that are reminiscent of New York City hip hop. The song is sonically built on slapping, percussion and sparse soundbeads. Minaj linked with Reid in late December 2017, and later explained to him what kind of beat she wanted for the song. She proceeded to rap it and give him the vibe. He made about 13 different beats, and Minaj picked out one. The song was done in early April 2018, including writing, production, mixing and mastering.\nLyrically, Minaj \"rails\" (criticises) online detractors and references negative press in the track. \"They need rappers like me! So they can get on their fucking keyboards and make me the bad guy, Chun-Li,\" she declares in the second interlude.\nA vertical music video for the song was released on April 13, 2018, via Minaj's YouTube channel. It is a video montage of videos filmed by Minaj while holding her phone vertically. In the visual, Minaj recites the lyrics of the song while posing on a couch, but relinquishes control of her phone for a couple of runway-like shots.\nOn April 27, Minaj released a teaser to promote the official music video. However, she confirmed on her Instagram that the teaser was not related in any way to the music video and is rather a video of her and Aliya Janell, the choreographer of the official video, doing a freestyle dance to the song.\nThe full accompanying video of the song was released on May 4, with the subtitle \u6625\u9e97, which translates to Chun-Li. It was directed by Steven Klein through Good Company Pictures. It features Asian futuristic/superhero-inspired outfits. Its music video won the Best Hip-Hop Video at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, and was nominated for Best Hip-Hop at the MTV Europe Music Awards. It has over 160 million views on YouTube. The video was accused of perpetuating Asian stereotypes and appropriating Asian culture by outlets like Cosmopolitan and Teen Vogue.\nBianca Gracie of Billboard said \"Minaj sounds cocky in the best way [\u2026] she resurrects her Nicki the Ninja alter-ego by assassinating the horn-driven beat with her lyrical wordplay, switching accents with ease.\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said, \"these are sparring records\u2013loose, pugnacious, a little uncentered [\u2026] 'Chun-Li' swaggers with the authority of the mid-90s. As is the norm, Ms. Minaj aims shots at unnamed antagonists, but in the past, that bluster felt truly targetless. But now, for the first time since the beginning of her career, there's someone who might plausibly shoot back, and win.\" John Kennedy from XXL said the song is \"open enough for Nicki [Minaj] to get her bars off \u00e0 la her mixtape days.\" Maeve McDermott of USA Today said,"

The song features a guest appearance from American rapper and singer Trippie Redd. The song was produced by S-X and Mally Mall. It was released for digital download and streaming by RBC Records and BMG on 31 January 2020 as the second single from the album. A pop-rap track, its lyrics are about how KSI has proven his doubters wrong and how they are finally accepting his success.\n\"Wake Up Call\" received positive reviews from music critics, who commonly praised the song's synth-driven instrumental and Trippie Redd's catchy chorus. The song charted at number 11 in the United Kingdom and further charted in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland and the Netherlands. An accompanying music video was released on the same day as the song. The video is a comedy-musical film, presented in the form of satirical behind-the-scenes footage, scene explanations, outtakes and closing credits, which stars KSI and Trippie Redd alongside a dance troupe, all dressed in memorable costumes.\nSpeaking on collaborating with Trippie Redd, KSI said, \"[It was] pretty standard. We asked him to jump on the track. He fucked with it [and] said yes. We linked up [at] the music video [shoot]... that\u2019s when we first met. He\u2019s a cool guy. We [were] chatting away. We said [that] we\u2019ll go to the studio one day.\" KSI has said that \"it made sense to have [Trippie Redd] on the track\". KSI explained, \"His vocals are very, very different to mine. Mine [are] laid-back and chilled, whereas he\u2019s singing properly. [So] it worked.\"\n\"Wake Up Call\" is a pop-rap track. The instrumental features bright synth pads and moderately mixed drum sequencing and bass rhythms. Trippie Redd performs the chorus in a melodic delivery, while KSI performs the two verses in a controlled flow.\nLyrically, \"Wake Up Call\" is KSI's message to the doubters that he is still here and proving people wrong. KSI told Apple Music, \"This [song] is to let people know that I'm coming for them. It's a wake-up call to let them know [that] I'm doing something with this music thing. It's time to take me seriously... This is just a little warning. I'm coming. There isn't anything [that] anyone can do about it.\" He continued, \"People thought they'd be able to just get rid of me, but I keep popping up and getting in people's faces... All these people want to jump on the bandwagon now [that] they realise [I'm] where it's at.\"\nOn 14 January 2020, KSI revealed during an interview with Vice that he would soon be releasing a new single which will \"feature a huge name in American rap\". On 25 January 2020, KSI posted the song's cover art to his social media pages, revealing the title as \"Wake Up Call\" and the featured artist as Trippie Redd, and the song was made available to pre-order on digital download services and pre-save on streaming services. \"Wake Up Call\" was released for digital download and streaming by RBC Records and BMG on 31 January 2020 as the second single from KSI's upcomign debut studio album.\nShortly after the release of \"Wake Up Call\", KSI started a TikTok video challenge called the \"#WakeUpCallChallenge\" to promote the song. KSI watched viewers' TikTok videos in a reaction video released to YouTube on 11 February 2020. TikTok videos using the challenge's hashtag have accumulated over 150 million views. A remix of \"Wake Up Call\" by producer Yoshi that replaces KSI's two verses from the original version with new verses by KSI, British rapper P Money and British YouTuber TBJZL (credited mononymously as Tobi) was released on 6 March 2020. An accompanying audio video was released to KSI's YouTube channel on the same day. On 13 March 2020, KSI performed \"Wake Up Call\" during BBC One's fundraising telethon Sport Relief. It was KSI's first-ever televised live music performance. Ahead of the live performance, KSI said, \"I want to nail this so [that] I can do more live TV and showcase a YouTuber that is able to go on to mainstream and do TV. It\u2019s nerve-racking, but it\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m hoping that people will see my performance and want to see more of my music.\"\n\"Wake Up Call\" was met with positive reviews from music critics. In his review for HotNewHipHop, R.

The band wrote and co-produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson. The song's arrangement is built around the acoustic piano. It was released on 23 October 2000 as the album's third single, reaching number 10 on the UK Singles Chart and becoming the band's second top 10 single in the country. Although \"Trouble\" failed to chart in the United States, the music press deemed it almost as successful as its predecessor, \"Yellow\".\nTwo different music videos were released: one for Europe and another for the United States, which is currently the only one available on the band's official YouTube channel. There is also an associated release titled Trouble \u2013 Norwegian Live EP, which came out in the summer of 2001 and consisted of five tracks recorded live by the band at Rockefeller Music Hall in Oslo. It was released exclusively in Norway, being Coldplay's fourth EP and first live release.\nAccording to Coldplay's lead singer Chris Martin, the song's writing was inspired by his own behaviour. Martin recalls, \"There were some bad things going in our band\u00a0... the song is about behaving badly towards somebody you really love and I was certainly doing that to some members of the band.\" He added that he supposed it was about time to stop acting like a knobhead. The four members of Coldplay are credited as co-writers of \"Trouble\".\nBritish record producer Ken Nelson and the band produced \"Trouble\" for their debut album, Parachutes. The track was recorded four times before the band got the take they preferred. The backing track was first recorded, and each time they add to see if it was working. However, they decided that the first three versions were not \"working\". The last take was recorded into Pro Tools with a shaker to provide the rhythm to the track. For the backing track, Will Champion played the drums and Martin on the piano which they recorded in a little wooden room. After Guy Berryman's bass was recorded, guitarist Jonny Buckland added the guitar section. In recording the piano section of the track, the band used two microphones\u2014one was brighter-sounding and the other had a fuller sound. Nelson, who wanted to keep the song simple, chose the fuller sound microphone for the mixing.\n\"Trouble\" was mixed in New York by American mix engineer Michael Brauer. The initial mixed version, which was sent back to the band and Nelson, fell short of their desired quality, so it had to be redone. According to Nelson, \"the vocal was overcompressed and the piano was too bright\". Despite this, Nelson did not blame Brauer because he was recording the album when the track was being mixed.\nThe song's lyrics have \"softer emotional themes\", including apologies, unrequited love, and longing. Its musicscape follows the minimalistic approach. \"Trouble\" is built around a piano, with a snare drum background that was mixed very low. The snare drum section tends to be inaudible when the guitars come in. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes, Inc., the song's time signature follows the common 4/4, with a tempo of 70 beats per minute. Martin's vocal range in the song spans from F\u266f\u2083 to A\u2084, the highest note being sung using the falsetto register, despite the fact Martin can reach this note in full voice.\n\"Trouble\" was released as the third single off Parachutes on 23 October 2000 in the United Kingdom and on 30 July 2001 in the United States. An associated extended play titled Trouble \u2013 Norwegian Live EP was released in the summer of 2001. In 2003, the song was featured on Coldplay's live album called Live 2003.\nAs they have for their other songs, Coldplay has refused to accept several offers to use \"Trouble\" for promotional tools. In 2004, the band rejected a multi-million Euro offer from Diet Coke and Gap to use the song and \"Don't Panic\", the fourth single from the album. They asked manager Phil Harvey to not refer such offers to them because \"a discussion might lead to compromise\". American actor Sylvester Stallone was interested to use the song for the soundtrack of his 2001 film Driven, but the band declined. The song was used in the season 1 finale of the FX television series The Shield.\n\"Trouble\" was a commercial success. It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band's second top 10 single in the United Kingdom after \"Yellow\". The"

(2012). The song was released as a promotional single to the iTunes Store as Single of the Week on October 22, 2012, and was later announced to be the second single from the album. On February 12, 2013, the song was released to Top 40 radio.\nThe song debuted and peaked at number one on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart.\n\"Hurricane\" exhibits elements of rap, gospel and pop. Built on a beat and multi-tracked harmonies, the song's instrumentation includes slow-bouncing keyboard tones, and drums. The song was written by Mendler and American songwriters Emanuel Kiriakou, Evan Kidd Bogart, and Andrew Goldstein, and produced by Kiriakou and Goldstein. Lyrically, the song gives ode to a disaster love, and reconciliation and perseverance in love. Mendler's vocals span from the low note of F\u2083 to the high note of F\u2085. In interview for Coup de Main Magazine, Mendler commented about recording a rap song for the first time. She said: \nI loved recording... you know the rap in 'Hurricane'? That was pretty fun. It was very experimental for me, I haven\u2019t done much rapping before. It was not a deliberate decision... we had written the song and I had come in to record it and then the guys were like: \"Why don\u2019t we just try rapping this part?\". So I did and then it kind of just worked and we decided to keep it. So not intentional, but sometimes things just happen in the moment.\nThe song received critical acclaim upon release. Tim Sendra of AllMusic said, \"[Hurricane] has clever fairy tale lyrics and an impassioned vocal (and a sassy rap section).\" Girls' Life magazine stated \"[Mendler] brings the beat in 'Hurricane', where she belts out some sweet raps about being in the middle of a stormy relationship.\" Kai of Embrace You magazine claimed that the track title was \"quite ironic when we\u2019re currently experiencing one of mother nature\u2019s conception of the said thing\" and later said that \"interestingly enough, I love this song. The acoustic opener caught me instantly and I\u2019m addicted to her 'oh, oh, oh\u2026' The singer\u2019s play on natural disasters as metaphors for the way she feels about her love interest once again showcases how witty she is as an artist. The fast paced pop rock driven track is both catchy and substantial.\"\nThe music video for \"Hurricane\" was directed by Robert Hales and filmed in London in March 2013. It was released on April 12, 2013. Naomi Scott appears as Mendler's best friend in the video.

The song features a guest appearance from American rapper and singer Trippie Redd. The song was produced by S-X and Mally Mall. It was released for digital download and streaming by RBC Records and BMG on 31 January 2020 as the second single from the album. A pop-rap track, its lyrics are about how KSI has proven his doubters wrong and how they are finally accepting his success.\n\"Wake Up Call\" received positive reviews from music critics, who commonly praised the song's synth-driven instrumental and Trippie Redd's catchy chorus. The song charted at number 11 in the United Kingdom and further charted in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland and the Netherlands. An accompanying music video was released on the same day as the song. The video is a comedy-musical film, presented in the form of satirical behind-the-scenes footage, scene explanations, outtakes and closing credits, which stars KSI and Trippie Redd alongside a dance troupe, all dressed in memorable costumes.\nSpeaking on collaborating with Trippie Redd, KSI said, \"[It was] pretty standard. We asked him to jump on the track. He fucked with it [and] said yes. We linked up [at] the music video [shoot]... that\u2019s when we first met. He\u2019s a cool guy. We [were] chatting away. We said [that] we\u2019ll go to the studio one day.\" KSI has said that \"it made sense to have [Trippie Redd] on the track\". KSI explained, \"His vocals are very, very different to mine. Mine [are] laid-back and chilled, whereas he\u2019s singing properly. [So] it worked.\"\n\"Wake Up Call\" is a pop-rap track. The instrumental features bright synth pads and moderately mixed drum sequencing and bass rhythms. Trippie Redd performs the chorus in a melodic delivery, while KSI performs the two verses in a controlled flow.\nLyrically, \"Wake Up Call\" is KSI's message to the doubters that he is still here and proving people wrong. KSI told Apple Music, \"This [song] is to let people know that I'm coming for them. It's a wake-up call to let them know [that] I'm doing something with this music thing. It's time to take me seriously... This is just a little warning. I'm coming. There isn't anything [that] anyone can do about it.\" He continued, \"People thought they'd be able to just get rid of me, but I keep popping up and getting in people's faces... All these people want to jump on the bandwagon now [that] they realise [I'm] where it's at.\"\nOn 14 January 2020, KSI revealed during an interview with Vice that he would soon be releasing a new single which will \"feature a huge name in American rap\". On 25 January 2020, KSI posted the song's cover art to his social media pages, revealing the title as \"Wake Up Call\" and the featured artist as Trippie Redd, and the song was made available to pre-order on digital download services and pre-save on streaming services. \"Wake Up Call\" was released for digital download and streaming by RBC Records and BMG on 31 January 2020 as the second single from KSI's upcomign debut studio album.\nShortly after the release of \"Wake Up Call\", KSI started a TikTok video challenge called the \"#WakeUpCallChallenge\" to promote the song. KSI watched viewers' TikTok videos in a reaction video released to YouTube on 11 February 2020. TikTok videos using the challenge's hashtag have accumulated over 150 million views. A remix of \"Wake Up Call\" by producer Yoshi that replaces KSI's two verses from the original version with new verses by KSI, British rapper P Money and British YouTuber TBJZL (credited mononymously as Tobi) was released on 6 March 2020. An accompanying audio video was released to KSI's YouTube channel on the same day. On 13 March 2020, KSI performed \"Wake Up Call\" during BBC One's fundraising telethon Sport Relief. It was KSI's first-ever televised live music performance. Ahead of the live performance, KSI said, \"I want to nail this so [that] I can do more live TV and showcase a YouTuber that is able to go on to mainstream and do TV. It\u2019s nerve-racking, but it\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m hoping that people will see my performance and want to see more of my music.\"\n\"Wake Up Call\" was met with positive reviews from music critics. In his review for HotNewHipHop, R.

The song was written by Knowles, Terius Nash, Shea Taylor, Ester Dean, Cainon Lamb, Julie Frost, Michael Bivins, Nathan Morris and Wanya Morris, and produced by Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor and Lamb. The song's conception was brought about by Knowles desiring to mix musical styles of the 1990s with the 1970s. It was sent to radio on October 4, 2011 as the fifth single from 4.\nFeaturing a sample of \"Uhh Ahh\" by Boyz II Men, \"Countdown\" incorporates aspects of hip hop, funk, reggae and world music. Lyrically, the female protagonist delivers a message of monogamy to her lover, celebrating self-worthiness as well as appreciating him. Several music critics were surprised by its maturity and compared it to Beyonc\u00e9's earlier solo work and with Destiny's Child. The song finished second in 2011's Pazz & Jop critics' poll and was included on the list of the year's best songs by various critics and publications including Spin, Rolling Stone and The Guardian. \"Countdown\"  peaked at number 71 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also peaked at number 12 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Countdown\" peaked at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart and number nine on the UK R&B Chart.\nAdria Petty directed the accompanying music video, which was recorded whilst Knowles was pregnant in August 2011. The music video sees Beyonc\u00e9 incorporate a mix of classic and modern dances, with references to pieces like that of Audrey Hepburn's appearance in Funny Face. Although well received by critics, the video faced controversy for the use of choreography from Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker's 1983 ballet Rosas danst Rosas. Beyonc\u00e9 performed \"Countdown\" on her 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 and Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live residency shows, as a video interlude on The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and on the set list of The Formation World Tour.\n\"Countdown\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Terius Nash, Shea Taylor, Ester Dean, Cainon Lamb, Julie Frost, Michael Bivins, Nathan Morris and Wanya Morris. Production was handled by Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor and Lamb. Bivins, Morris and Morris are credited as \"Countdown\" samples Boyz II Men's 1991 single, \"Uhh Ahh\". A private listening party for Knowles' fourth studio album was held on May 12, 2011 at the Sony offices in New York City, where one of the five songs previewed was \"Countdown\". While playing the song, Knowles commented: \"[Jay-Z] liked it. I do not think he was dissecting it, just thinking of what he could do to it as a rapper.\"\nOn June 7, 2011, both \"Party\" and \"Countdown\" leaked online, followed by the whole album, three weeks prior to its official release date on June 28, 2011. This was followed by cease-and-desist notices from Beyonc\u00e9's legal team, who forced multiple media sites to remove download links to the songs. Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Knowles' official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and a quote. On June 24, 2011, \"Countdown\" was the ninth song to be chosen. The quote found Beyonc\u00e9 elaborating on the song's inspiration: \"I really liked mixing the 90s with the 70s. I put those two together and it was so much fun putting bridges back into songs, all the things in music that I love that I feel I just want to hear again.\" She also referred to \"Countdown\" as \"really experimental\". Concerning the development \"Countdown\" and the reason for using the sample, Beyonc\u00e9 stated:\nI wanted to do something refreshing and different, so I mixed genres and drew inspiration from touring, traveling, watching rock bands, and attending festivals\u2026 I was like a mad scientist, putting lots of different songs together. Boyz II Men were the first ones to put Destiny's Child on tour. They showed us how to treat an opening act and I will never forget that. That was 15 years ago! Wow, 15 years! I'm old.\nOn September 22, 2011, Columbia Records posted the cover art of \"Countdown\" on the official website of KZII-FM, most commonly known as \"102.5 Kiss FM\". It was the same photograph spread for \"Countdown\" in the album notes for 4 and it was taken by German photographer Ellen von Unwerth. \"Countdown\" impacted both rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on"

All these people want to jump on the bandwagon now [that] they realise [I'm] where it's at.\"\nOn 14 January 2020, KSI revealed during an interview with Vice that he would soon be releasing a new single which will \"feature a huge name in American rap\". On 25 January 2020, KSI posted the song's cover art to his social media pages, revealing the title as \"Wake Up Call\" and the featured artist as Trippie Redd, and the song was made available to pre-order on digital download services and pre-save on streaming services. \"Wake Up Call\" was released for digital download and streaming by RBC Records and BMG on 31 January 2020 as the second single from KSI's upcomign debut studio album.\nShortly after the release of \"Wake Up Call\", KSI started a TikTok video challenge called the \"#WakeUpCallChallenge\" to promote the song. KSI watched viewers' TikTok videos in a reaction video released to YouTube on 11 February 2020. TikTok videos using the challenge's hashtag have accumulated over 150 million views.

An accompanying audio video was released to KSI's YouTube channel on the same day. On 13 March 2020, KSI performed \"Wake Up Call\" during BBC One's fundraising telethon Sport Relief. It was KSI's first-ever televised live music performance. Ahead of the live performance, KSI said, \"I want to nail this so [that] I can do more live TV and showcase a YouTuber that is able to go on to mainstream and do TV. It\u2019s nerve-racking, but it\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m hoping that people will see my performance and want to see more of my music.\"\n\"Wake Up Call\" was met with positive reviews from music critics. In his review for HotNewHipHop, R.

The song features a guest appearance from British YouTuber and rapper KSI and uncredited vocals from British singer-songwriter Ella Henderson. It was released for digital download and streaming by Atlantic Records and Warner Music Group on 24 July 2020 as a standalone single. An upbeat, feel-good house track, its lyrics are about leaving a toxic relationship and feeling happy that the relationship has ended and not carrying a burden.\nAn accompanying music video was released on 24 July 2020. The light-hearted video stars Dawe and KSI among a cast, playing basketball and football. The group start out completely useless at both sports, though they improve as the video progresses. An acoustic version of \"Lighter\", which credits Henderson and features a new verse by KSI, was released on 28 August 2020 alongside an accompanying music video.\n\"Lighter\" received positive reviews from music critics, who commonly praised the song's catchiness and KSI's energetic verse, and it was dubbed \"one of the hits of the summer\". The song peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart and it further charted in eight other countries. \"Lighter\" was one of the UK's best-selling songs of 2020 and it has been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for exceeding sales of 600,000 units in the country. \"Lighter\" was nominated for the BRIT Award for Song of the Year at the 2021 ceremony.\nElla Henderson wrote \"Lighter\" with British songwriter Jonny Lattimer. The song was \"ballady and slow\" which \"didn't fit her artist profile at the time\". Henderson \"had a lot of other releases planned and it wasn't really right for her\". She sent the song to Nathan Dawe, who \"sped it up, pitched the vocal up and completely transformed it\". Henderson \"thought it was sick and wished [Dawe] luck with it\". Dawe and his management felt that \"Lighter\" should feature a verse from a British rapper, similar to his previous single \"Flowers\" (2019), which features British rapper Jaykae, leading to the decision to feature KSI on \"Lighter\". Dawe explained, \"I've known of KSI for a long time and I've been quite a fan of his work... His music recently that's started to come out, the quality [of it has] been really good... I was listening to [his album] thinking, 'KSI's actually sick!' So I [asked] my manager, \"What do you think? Would [KSI] work?' [My manager said], 'Let's reach out [to him].'\" They sent the track to KSI, who listened to it and \"thought it was an absolute banger\" and agreed to \"jump on it\". KSI recalled, \"When I heard [the song], I thought, 'This is a smash!' I knew instantly what I needed to do to elevate it to another level.\" KSI wrote a verse for \"Lighter\" at his home in London. He recalled that \"it took [him] a couple of hours to write the verse\". He recorded the verse at an arranged recording studio session which \"took less than an hour\". Dawe could not be present at the recording studio due to COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions, but he spectated the session via Zoom.\n\"Lighter\" is an upbeat house track. Henderson's vocals are sped-up and pitched-up. She sings about leaving a toxic relationship and feeling happy that the relationship has ended and not carrying a burden. The lyrics give inspiration to those who are struggling through a breakup, heartbreak, or even through losing a toxic person in their life, and feeling better despite the hard times. Henderson's chorus builds up to a piano-house drop. KSI's energetic rap verse is introduced in the break of the track, leading to \"Lighter\" being labelled as a crosssover of house and rap. Dawe described \"Lighter\" as \"a summer anthem [with] a feel-good vibe\". The staff of Sport Playlists similarly described \"Lighter\" as an \"anthemic slice of feel-good dance music\" that was \"written with summer in mind\".\nOn 12 July 2020, Dawe announced via social media that he would soon be releasing a new single. The song's title, featured artist, cover art and release date were revealed three days later and \"Lighter\" was made"

Normani posted a snippet\u00a0of \"Wild Side\" to her social media on February 5, 2021, with the caption, \"know it's been awhile\". Cardi B heard the snippet and later joined \"Wild Side\" according to the singer, with Normani stating \"I knew I wanted to do something with her, but I was already in rehearsal for three weeks for the music video. We had already been in rehearsal, and I called her stylist because he's also my stylist, and I was like, 'Yo, like, we gotta figure something out. Like this link-up has to happen. There's no other way. It just has to happen, there's no option. 'And he was like, 'Actually, she mentioned \"Wild Side\", She was like, \"Is it that \"Wild Side\" song? Is it the \"Wild Side\" song?\"' Because I had posted the clip like two months ago\".\nAfter speculation of a collaboration between the two, Normani archived all but one post on her Instagram page on July 12, 2021, hinting at a possible relevant announcement. The following day, Cardi B stated that she had \"a little secret\" to tell her audience the following day. On July 14, Normani confirmed the title, release date and cover art of the collaborative single on her respective social media pages. Both performers had interacted in the past multiple times, with Normani making a special appearance in the music video for \"WAP\" by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion in August 2020 alongside other singers and personalities like Kylie Jenner and Rosal\u00eda.\n\"Wild Side\" received critical acclaim upon its release. MTV News praised Normani's vocal performance, stating that she \"delivers her silky verses with serenity and precision, sizzling with temptation and allure with every breath. She never leaves a moment unmilked; her voice masterfully floats along the song's subtle yet thumping production \u2013 sampling fellow R&B goddess Aaliyah's 1996 hit 'One In A Million'\", and praised Cardi B's rapping on the song, noting that she \"slides in with ease.\" For Pitchfork, Vrinda Jagota called it \"a sultry R&B showstopper\", adding, \"If 'Motivation' was Normani's jubilant breakthrough, 'Wild Side' is the meticulously crafted showpiece that proves she's here to stay.\" For USA Today, Rasha Ali deemed it \"a steamy, sensual slow jam.\"\nIn August 2021, Billboard placed the single on their 15 Best Aaliyah Samples in Modern R&B/Hip-Hop list.\n\nIn the United States, \"Wild Side\" debuted at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Normani's third top 20 solo hit, and Cardi B's 16th; while becoming Normani's highest debuting song to date.

Sasha Fierce (2008). It was written by Knowles, Angela Beyinc\u00e9, Solange Knowles and the Bama Boyz and produced by the Bama Boyz and Knowles. \"Why Don't You Love Me\" is an R&B song with disco influences that is set in a retro style. According to its lyrics, Knowles questions her love interest about why he does not value her fabulousness. Its 1960s-styled music video was directed by Melina Matsoukas and Knowles under the alias Bee-Z, and it stars the latter as \"B.B. Homemaker\". Knowles pays homage to Bettie Page in the video, which critics universally commended for its 1960's style sets and costumes. They also complimented Knowles for her acting skills.\n\"Why Don't You Love Me\" was well received by critics. It topped the United States Hot Dance Club Songs chart for one week in February 2010, a little over one year after the original release of I Am... Sasha Fierce. On August 27, 2010, the song was released as a single in the United Kingdom. It eventually charted at number 51 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 14 on its R&B Singles Chart. Although not being released elsewhere, \"Why Don't You Love Me\" garnered some attention in Australia, where it charted at number 73; it bubbled under the main charts of Belgium and reached number 44 on Slovakia Airplay Chart. In the US, it emerged as the nineteenth most played track in dance clubs in 2010. \"Why Don't You Love Me\" was a part of Knowles' set list for the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, the Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live revue, the Mrs Carter Show World Tour and the On the Run Tour.\n\"Why Don't You Love Me\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Solange Knowles, Angie Beyinc\u00e9 and produced as well as co-written by The Bama Boyz. Jonathan Wells of Bama Boyz said that they decided to try something different from what they usually do, by mixing several genres for \"Why Don't You Love Me\". The song's inspiration came from the time they spent in London at the end of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles' The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience tour in promotion of her second studio album B'Day (2006). The writing and production of the song began in London and was finished stateside in early 2008. They admitted that the song's structure was unusual, however they were happy that it ended up in the Knowles' hands. After The Bama Boyz produced two tracks on Solange Knowles' second studio album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams (2008), she asked them to put instrumentals together for her to write for her sister Beyonc\u00e9.\nThe Bama Boyz almost intentionally left the instrumental for \"Why Don't You Love Me\" out, since they thought that the song did not sound like the tracks Beyonc\u00e9 was recording for her upcoming album, at that particular time. However, Jesse Rankins explained that they later decided to put the instrumental for \"Why Don't You Love Me\" in the email because they knew that Solange likes weird records, but, they made sure to send it last. Out of all the mainstream-inspired attempts The Bama Boyz sent to Solange, she eventually chose that last and most unexpected track and penned \"Why Don't You Love Me\". Jonathan Wells commented: \"When they heard Solange's demo, we were excited because that track was more our true sound than any of the others [sent], but we still kinda didn't believe Beyonc\u00e9 would cut it...but we hoped!\"\nBeyonc\u00e9 came to Houston's Music World Studios for a recording session a few months after Solange had cut the demo. Knowles invited The Bama Boyz into her session at the Houston's Music World Studios to listen to the early versions of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Unexpectedly, after Beyonc\u00e9 played \"Halo\", \"Why Don't You Love Me\" came blasting through the speakers with Knowles singing the song. The Bama Boyz were thrilled that she recorded it and loved the song. According to \"Anti-Music\", the song was nearly discarded twice; the first time was when EMI Music prepared a demo of the song to send to other artists without knowing that Knowles had already recorded the song, and the second came during the"

The song was written by Alex Geringas, Paddy Dalton and songwriter Busbee, which lyrically talks about how actions talk louder than words. Musically, the song is a club-inspired song. \"Show Me\" premiered on Idolator on August 3, 2011, and was released on August 23, 2011 via Hollywood Records.\n\"Show Me\" is composed as an uptempo dance-pop and electropop song with a synthpop beat. The song received mostly positive reviews, with music critics complimenting its club anthem-like nature and the synth pop associated with it. The song peaked at number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs in the United States, becoming Sutta's first solo number-one single and first Pussycat Doll to ever top the Billboard Club chart as a solo artist. \"Show Me\" is Jessica's second time at the top following her 2007 collaboration with Dave Aud\u00e9, \"Make It Last\" while her Paul Van Dyk feature \"White Lies\" peaked at No. 3 in the same year.\nA music video was shot for the single, featuring Sutta in an underground club, dancing to the track. The video received positive reviews, with some finding similarities to Janet Jackson's \"All Nite (Don't Stop)\" and Britney Spears' \"Till the World Ends\". The song was featured in the ABC Family original movie \"Teen Spirit\". A remix EP was released on iTunes.\nWritten by Busbee, Alex Geringas and Paddy Dalton, and produced by Busbee (who has also penned tracks for Timbaland and Katy Perry's \"If We Ever Meet Again\" and Lady Antebellum), \"Show Me\" explodes with shuffle-fueled energy, reaffirming Jessica as the soulful vocalist. \"\n\"I've had a love of dance music for as long as I can remember. When you're on the floor, you feel dance music in your feet, in your heart. It does put you in a trance in some ways, and I hope my music will do that\", she says of the process.\n\"We got a single a couple of months ago, demo style, and it was just so awesome that i said \"Can I please record this tomorrow?\" So, I went into the studio and recorded it\". Sutta stated that the song talks about how action speaks louder than words. \"I feel like that applies to a lot of people in relationships\", she said. The song was mixed by Grammy-nominated Veronica Ferraro. In addition,it was remixed by top dance music producers Dave Aud\u00e9, Alex Gaudino/Jason Rooney, and Ralphi Rosario. \"Show Me\" is a club-inspired song, which includes strong synthpop and dance-pop genres, as it was clear Sutta really enjoys dance music.\n\"Show Me\" premiered on Idolator on August 3, 2011. The song appeared as a bonus track on 'Now That's What I Call Music! Vol. 39' and was featured in the ABC Family original movie \"Teen Spirit\". It was released digitally on August 23. Sutta performed the song at House of Blues on August 9, 2011. The song was released in Australia and New Zealand on August 26, 2011, while its due to release in the Netherlands in September or October 2011.\nThe song received positive reviews from critics. DisneyInfo.net described the song as \"an explosive shuffle-inspired dance track sure to thrill longtime fans of Jessica and the Pussycat Dolls\". \"Idolator's Robbie Daw began its review by writing that Jessica was always his most favorite Pussycat Dolls. He complimented the song for its energy and described it as \"club-ready single\".MTV Buzzworthy described the song as \"a delicious new dance floor anthem\". \"Sutta's brand new synth-pop explosion is all smoke machines and strobe lights, as the singer takes her man to task: \"Love is not a gimme, gimme/If you really with me, you gotta show me, show me\", the former Doll cautions during the chorus. It's a total smash! Even if she's no longer a part of all things PCD, Sutta's still snatching wigs and taking over the dance floor as a Club Queen in her own right.\" Jeff Benjamin of Billboard described the song as \"a high-energy dance track, with a \"show me love\" hook that is begging to be shouted at clubs.\"\nMike Hess of Celebuzz praised the song for its \"infectious new tune\", \"the club-worthy beat\" and the \"catchy hook\". \nAOL Music wrote that the song is a \"sleek, sexy club track sure to get bodies moving and build anticipation for her forthcoming full-length\". MuuMuse described the song as a \"throbbin\u2019 club anthem full of pulsating synthesizers and slamming beats\". Instinct Magazine wrote: \"We tend to adore dance divas whose first hit songs have titles with \"Show Me\" (Robyn's \"Show Me Love\" in 1997 and the very different Robin S.'s \"Show Me Love\" in 1993), so we're hearting what Jessica Sutta is showing us in the new millennium.\" \nTheShowt.com wrote that \"Show Me\" \"is destined to have dance floors across"

Warren wanted to work with Beyonc\u00e9 since the Destiny's Child eras, but admitted that \"I Was Here\" was the ideal timing, \"I thought that the one artist who would be my dream to sing ['I Was Here'] would be Beyonc\u00e9. This is one of those magical stories where what is meant to be actually happens.\"\nIn May 2011, Warren played the song on a guitar over the phone to Beyonc\u00e9's husband Jay-Z, who then called her. Upon hearing \"I Was Here\", Beyonc\u00e9 got chills, and immediately made up her mind, \"Oh my god, I have to have this song.\" September 2011 was going to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and Beyonc\u00e9 thought that the song would perfectly complete her album, which had nearly reached completion. The mastering of 4 was delayed to allow Beyonc\u00e9 to record the song. Warren was present at the recording sessions, which took place two days following her conversation with Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z on the phone. She said, \"There's nothing better than to hear the song that you came up with [sung back]. It's like your heart found another heart\", before adding:\nI've never had chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyonc\u00e9 sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul and became the song that was coming from hers. In all my life, I have never heard anything as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever be one of the best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.\n\"I Was Here\" is a downtempo R&B ballad that is instrumentally based on synthesizers undercurrent, indie rock guitars, musical keyboards and big drums provided by Tedder and Kutzle. The sound of the song's recurring hook uses a combination of a xylophone and a piano. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the"

The song was written by Knowles, Terius Nash, Shea Taylor, Ester Dean, Cainon Lamb, Julie Frost, Michael Bivins, Nathan Morris and Wanya Morris, and produced by Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor and Lamb. The song's conception was brought about by Knowles desiring to mix musical styles of the 1990s with the 1970s. It was sent to radio on October 4, 2011 as the fifth single from 4.\nFeaturing a sample of \"Uhh Ahh\" by Boyz II Men, \"Countdown\" incorporates aspects of hip hop, funk, reggae and world music. Lyrically, the female protagonist delivers a message of monogamy to her lover, celebrating self-worthiness as well as appreciating him. Several music critics were surprised by its maturity and compared it to Beyonc\u00e9's earlier solo work and with Destiny's Child. The song finished second in 2011's Pazz & Jop critics' poll and was included on the list of the year's best songs by various critics and publications including Spin, Rolling Stone and The Guardian. \"Countdown\"  peaked at number 71 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also peaked at number 12 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Countdown\" peaked at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart and number nine on the UK R&B Chart.\nAdria Petty directed the accompanying music video, which was recorded whilst Knowles was pregnant in August 2011. The music video sees Beyonc\u00e9 incorporate a mix of classic and modern dances, with references to pieces like that of Audrey Hepburn's appearance in Funny Face. Although well received by critics, the video faced controversy for the use of choreography from Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker's 1983 ballet Rosas danst Rosas. Beyonc\u00e9 performed \"Countdown\" on her 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 and Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live residency shows, as a video interlude on The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and on the set list of The Formation World Tour.\n\"Countdown\" was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Terius Nash, Shea Taylor, Ester Dean, Cainon Lamb, Julie Frost, Michael Bivins, Nathan Morris and Wanya Morris. Production was handled by Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor and Lamb. Bivins, Morris and Morris are credited as \"Countdown\" samples Boyz II Men's 1991 single, \"Uhh Ahh\". A private listening party for Knowles' fourth studio album was held on May 12, 2011 at the Sony offices in New York City, where one of the five songs previewed was \"Countdown\". While playing the song, Knowles commented: \"[Jay-Z] liked it. I do not think he was dissecting it, just thinking of what he could do to it as a rapper.\"\nOn June 7, 2011, both \"Party\" and \"Countdown\" leaked online, followed by the whole album, three weeks prior to its official release date on June 28, 2011. This was followed by cease-and-desist notices from Beyonc\u00e9's legal team, who forced multiple media sites to remove download links to the songs. Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Knowles' official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and a quote. On June 24, 2011, \"Countdown\" was the ninth song to be chosen. The quote found Beyonc\u00e9 elaborating on the song's inspiration: \"I really liked mixing the 90s with the 70s. I put those two together and it was so much fun putting bridges back into songs, all the things in music that I love that I feel I just want to hear again.\" She also referred to \"Countdown\" as \"really experimental\". Concerning the development \"Countdown\" and the reason for using the sample, Beyonc\u00e9 stated:\nI wanted to do something refreshing and different, so I mixed genres and drew inspiration from touring, traveling, watching rock bands, and attending festivals\u2026 I was like a mad scientist, putting lots of different songs together. Boyz II Men were the first ones to put Destiny's Child on tour. They showed us how to treat an opening act and I will never forget that. That was 15 years ago! Wow, 15 years! I'm old.\nOn September 22, 2011, Columbia Records posted the cover art of \"Countdown\" on the official website of KZII-FM, most commonly known as \"102.5 Kiss FM\". It was the same photograph spread for \"Countdown\" in the album notes for 4 and it was taken by German photographer Ellen von Unwerth. \"Countdown\" impacted both rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on"

It was written by Ester Dean and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, with lyrics reflecting the different perspectives on relationships and how one can perceive a relationship different from the outside. It opens with an electro-crescendo followed by Rowland's vocals which were produced by Emily Wright; the song's production is based upon layered synths and drums, programmed by Dr. Luke. Dean helped Rowland to record the song, which Rowland said made her cry as it reminded her of her own experiences in past relationships. \"Rose Colored Glasses\" also had an effect on Rowland's vocals, causing them to swell. The song was serviced to rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on June 29, 2010. Critics praised \"Rose Colored Glasses\" as one of Rowland's strongest vocal and emotional performances to date.\nThe arrangement and delivery were praised as being classy, while the critics felt that the overall emotion of the song gave Rowland the best chance of achieving US chart success. \"Rose Colored Glasses\" was released on June 28, 2010 across some parts of Europe, and a day later in the United States and Canada, where it was intended to be one of the album's two lead singles. An accompanying 3-D concept music video, directed by British fashion photographer John \"Rankin\" Wadell was released, featuring atmospheric visuals and mood-lit scenes including streamers, doves, and rose petals. Reception for the video was positive, praising its simplicity and noting the stunning visuals and variety of outfits worn by Rowland. The single had limited chart success, entering the top-forty radio airplay charts in Slovakia and the United States, but failing to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100. It is only included on international versions of Here I Am, which was released later in the year than the domestic (US) version of the album.\nAt the 2010 Winter Music Conference, Rowland confirmed she was ready to release the lead single from her third studio album. On March 29, 2010, during the conference, she debuted the David Guetta-helmed song, \"Commander\" with her live performance of the song. However, just prior to its release, Rowland's label (Universal Motown) confirmed that the song would only be fully released as a single in international markets. At the end of May 2010, Rowland announced that \"Shake Them Haters Off\", penned by singer-songwriter Ne-Yo, would be the American lead single for her third album. Prior to its release, \"Shake Them Haters Off\" was replaced by two new songs, one for urban  radio and one for contemporary hit radio. \"Rose Colored Glasses\" was unveiled as the pop lead single, and serviced to both contemporary and rhythmic radio on June 29, 2010. It was also released for digital download on June 29, 2010 in Canada and the United States. The urban single, \"Grown Woman\", was also serviced to urban, urban adult contemporary and rhythmic radio on June 29, 2010. At the time of this announcement, it meant that three singles would precede the album before its worldwide release. However, the album was pushed back into 2011, in which time two other singles to preceded the album \u2013 \"Forever and a Day\" (2010) and \"Motivation\" (2011).\n\u201cRose Colored Glasses\u201d is a mid-tempo electro ballad written by Ester Dean and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald. The song, which opens with an electro-crescendo followed by Rowland's vocals, has a layered synth production, courtesy of Dr. Luke. In the lyrics, Rowland \"explores the subtle ways that perspective can truly change everything...[telling] a story of a relationship that, on the outside, seems troubled.\"  Lizzie Goodwin, from entertainment website Gather.com, called the song an \"addition to your break-up/female empowerment playlist.\" Dean accompanied Rowland in the recording studios when she recorded the song.\n\nDuring an interview for Rowland's segment in the iheartradio concert series, it was revealed that \"Rose Colored Glasses\" had made Rowland cry.

It was written by Diane Warren, while production was handled by OneRepublic members Ryan Tedder and Brent Kutzle, alongside Kuk Harrell; while Beyonc\u00e9 is credited on the vocal production. \"I Was Here\" is a reflective R&B ballad, in which Beyonc\u00e9 vulnerably reviews her past, wanting to leave an impact on the world before her life comes to an end. Described as a \"career song\" by Warren, its development was motivated by the September 11 attacks in the United States.\nFollowing the release of 4, \"I Was Here\" charted at number 131 on the UK Singles Chart, 74 on the Swiss Singles Chart, and 44 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart in early July 2011. Later, in 2012, the song also appeared on several charts internationally.\nA music video for the song was released on August 19, 2012 and it features Beyonc\u00e9 performing the song live at the United Nations General Assembly while images of volunteers doing humanitarian work were projected on the screen behind her. It was donated to the World Humanitarian Day and aimed to create social media history with one billion people sharing the message of doing something good for another person. Upon its release, it received positive reviews from music critics who praised the projections, Beyonc\u00e9's vocal performance and her look.\nIn late July, the song was included on the soundtrack for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. \"I Was Here\" was also part of Beyonc\u00e9's set list for her residency show 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 and was used in the Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live shows during an interlude. The live video from the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4 appeared online on November 16, 2011 containing Beyonc\u00e9's home movies and professional highlights. \"I Was Here\" was covered by Lea Michele for Glee's soundtrack album Glee: The Music, The Graduation Album (2012).\n\"I Was Here\" was written by Diane Warren and was produced by Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Beyonc\u00e9 and Kuk Harrell. \"I Was Here\" is the only song on the record that was not co-written by Beyonc\u00e9. On June 1, 2011, Warren revealed in an interview for the New York Post's PopWrap that she wrote \"the best [song she has] ever written\" a week and a half ago and that Beyonc\u00e9 had already recorded it for her fourth studio album 4.

It was sent to US contemporary hit radio on May 14, 2013, as the fourth and final single from their fourth studio album Overexposed (2012). The song was written by Adam Levine, Nathaniel Motte, Ryan Tedder and Noel Zancanella; the latter two are also the producers. \"Love Somebody\" is a dance-pop song that lyrically equates love and physical intimacy and explores \"salvation on the dance floor\".\nUpon release, the song was a respectable success on the charts and became the fourth top ten hit from the album on the Billboard Hot 100. Despite its success, the single received mixed reviews from music critics who praised its composition, linking it to the works by Coldplay, but criticized its production and Levine's vocals. Following the release of the album, due to strong digital downloads, the song peaked at number eight on the singles chart in South Korea.\nIn mid-2011, Maroon 5 started working on their fourth studio album. One of the members of the band, James Valentine spoke to Billboard and revealed their plans to release their fourth studio album in early 2012. On March 26, 2012, the band posted a video on YouTube featuring numerous scenes from the band in the studio, recording the album. On June 26, 2012, the album was released under the title Overexposed.\nThe band's lead singer Adam Levine co-wrote \"Love Somebody\" with 3OH!3 singer Nathaniel Motte, Noel Zancanella and OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder. The latter two also produced it and provided programming and keys. Tedder and Zancanella also co-wrote and co-produced another song for Overexposed titled \"Lucky Strike\". \"Love Somebody\" was engineered by Smith Carlson at the Patriot Studios in Denver and Noah \"Mailbox\" Passovoy at the Conway Studios in Los Angeles; Eric Eylands served as the engineering assistant. Serban Ghenea mixed the song at the Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach. John Hanes served as engineer for mix, while Phil Seaford as mixing assistant.\n\"Love Somebody\" is a dance-pop song with a length of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. It is set in the key of C\u266f major and its instrumentation consists of piano and guitar. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone described the song's synth hook as the Sly Stone-meets-Eurythmics. According to Chris Payne of Billboard, Tedder and Zancanella's influence is all over the song and inches through the verses \"before bubbling over just before the chorus kicks in.\" Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly in a review of the album, wrote that the song together with \"Daylight\" have \"thickly\" produced choruses. Lyrically, \"Love Somebody\" equates love and physical intimacy, with Levine singing: \"I really wanna love somebody [...] I really wanna touch somebody\". Nate Chinen of The New York Times described the lyrical theme of the song as \"a plea for salvation on the dance floor or some other horizontal surface\".\nSuzanne Byrne of RT\u00c9.ie wrote that \"Love Somebody\" alongside \"Daylight\", \"The Man Who Never Lied\" and \"Lucky Strike\" are potential single releases. Brittany Frederick of StarPulse called the song \"earnest\", while Cameron Adams of Herald Sun described it as Coldplay \"trying to be\" Katy Perry. Similarly as Adams, PopMatters' Evan Sawdey wrote that \"Love Somebody\" is the group's \"sky-scraping Coldplay moment\". Jeremy Thomas of 411 Mania labeled the song as one of the more emotional tracks on Overexposed and a \"rare moment where the overhanging production tricks ease up just enough to make for an honest-to-God song with emotion and not just a laser scope aimed at the Billboard charts.\nIn a review of the album, Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music wrote that the band had left \"the strutting cockerel heat\" of their 2004 single \"This Love\" for the \"saturated rave bliss\" of \"Love Somebody\" or \"The Man Who Never Lied\". According to him that's an effect of the market they have chosen to contribute on. Billboard's Chris Payne thought that the song fades into the background of the other stronger tracks on Overexposed. Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly was more critical towards Levine's vocals on \"Love Somebody\" and wrote that the singer's voice is processed in a high disaffected whine \u2014 \"like a male Rihanna or an android castrato\", which according to him, it's ideal for tracing the contours of a pop hook.\nUpon the release of Overexposed, due to strong digital downloads, \"Love Somebody\" debuted on the South Korea Gaon International Chart at number eight on June 24, 2012, with sales of 35,892 digital copies. The next week, it fell"

It was written by Diane Warren, while production was handled by OneRepublic members Ryan Tedder and Brent Kutzle, alongside Kuk Harrell; while Beyonc\u00e9 is credited on the vocal production. \"I Was Here\" is a reflective R&B ballad, in which Beyonc\u00e9 vulnerably reviews her past, wanting to leave an impact on the world before her life comes to an end. Described as a \"career song\" by Warren, its development was motivated by the September 11 attacks in the United States.\nFollowing the release of 4, \"I Was Here\" charted at number 131 on the UK Singles Chart, 74 on the Swiss Singles Chart, and 44 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart in early July 2011. Later, in 2012, the song also appeared on several charts internationally.\nA music video for the song was released on August 19, 2012 and it features Beyonc\u00e9 performing the song live at the United Nations General Assembly while images of volunteers doing humanitarian work were projected on the screen behind her. It was donated to the World Humanitarian Day and aimed to create social media history with one billion people sharing the message of doing something good for another person. Upon its release, it received positive reviews from music critics who praised the projections, Beyonc\u00e9's vocal performance and her look.\nIn late July, the song was included on the soundtrack for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. \"I Was Here\" was also part of Beyonc\u00e9's set list for her residency show 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00e9 and was used in the Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live shows during an interlude. The live video from the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4 appeared online on November 16, 2011 containing Beyonc\u00e9's home movies and professional highlights. \"I Was Here\" was covered by Lea Michele for Glee's soundtrack album Glee: The Music, The Graduation Album (2012).\n\"I Was Here\" was written by Diane Warren and was produced by Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Beyonc\u00e9 and Kuk Harrell. \"I Was Here\" is the only song on the record that was not co-written by Beyonc\u00e9. On June 1, 2011, Warren revealed in an interview for the New York Post's PopWrap that she wrote \"the best [song she has] ever written\" a week and a half ago and that Beyonc\u00e9 had already recorded it for her fourth studio album 4. She described it as \"a career song and probably my favorite thing I've ever written\". The development of \"I Was Here\" was motivated by the September 11 attacks. Warren wanted to work with Beyonc\u00e9 since the Destiny's Child eras, but admitted that \"I Was Here\" was the ideal timing, \"I thought that the one artist who would be my dream to sing ['I Was Here'] would be Beyonc\u00e9. This is one of those magical stories where what is meant to be actually happens.\"\nIn May 2011, Warren played the song on a guitar over the phone to Beyonc\u00e9's husband Jay-Z, who then called her. Upon hearing \"I Was Here\", Beyonc\u00e9 got chills, and immediately made up her mind, \"Oh my god, I have to have this song.\" September 2011 was going to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and Beyonc\u00e9 thought that the song would perfectly complete her album, which had nearly reached completion. The mastering of 4 was delayed to allow Beyonc\u00e9 to record the song. Warren was present at the recording sessions, which took place two days following her conversation with Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z on the phone. She said, \"There's nothing better than to hear the song that you came up with [sung back]. It's like your heart found another heart\", before adding:\nI've never had chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyonc\u00e9 sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul and became the song that was coming from hers. In all my life, I have never heard anything as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever be one of the best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.\n\"I Was Here\" is a downtempo R&B ballad that is instrumentally based on synthesizers undercurrent, indie rock guitars, musical keyboards and big drums provided by Tedder and Kutzle.

It was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Scott Storch and Robert Waller and produced by Storch with guitar played by musician Aaron Fishbein. Beyonc\u00e9 decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song as the third single; the song was sent by Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 19, 2003. \"Me, Myself and I\" is an R&B song about dealing with a philandering partner and learning from the consequences.\nThe live performance of the song from The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience Live was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 2009, and the original version earned Beyonc\u00e9, Storch and Waller an ASCAP Pop Music Award. \"Me, Myself and I\" peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Beyonc\u00e9's fourth consecutive top-five single in the United States. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The single reached the top twenty in Australia, the Netherlands, Scotland and the United Kingdom.\nDirected by Johan Renck, the accompanying music video follows the plot of the song's theme and the events in the video are played in reverse. \"Me, Myself and I\" was part of Beyonc\u00e9's set lists on the Dangerously in Love Tour (2003), Verizon Ladies First Tour (2004), The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience (2007), the I Am... World Tour (2009\u201310) and The Formation World Tour (2016)\nAfter the release of her former group Destiny's Child's third studio album Survivor (2001), Beyonc\u00e9 worked on her debut solo studio album, Dangerously in Love. She stated that it was more personal than her previous records because she only had to write for herself. She contacted various musical collaborators, including Storch and Waller. The musical style of \"Me, Myself and I\" is different from the style of her previous singles; Beyonc\u00e9 decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song for the next single. Following the release of the song, Beyonc\u00e9 told Corey Moss of MTV News: \"['Me, Myself and I'] is really powerful. It talks about women basically listening to their inner voice and knowing that they will never disappoint themselves.\"\n\"Me, Myself and I\" was the third single released from Dangerously in Love, which followed \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". It was sent to rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio on October 19, 2003. A CD single was released on October 21, 2003 in the United States, which contained Junior Vasquez's dance radio mix of \"Krazy in Luv\" as its B-side. It officially impacted contemporary hit radio in the United States on November 12, 2003. On December 16, 2003, a 12-inch single was released in the United States. The single was released in selected European countries in January 2004, including Austria, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\"Me, Myself and I\" was released in the United Kingdom as a maxi single on January 12, 2004, as two CD singles and a 12-inch vinyl single; the first disc included a radio edit of the song and \"Dangerously in Love 2\" (2003), and the second one contained two remixes of \"Me, Myself and I\". In 2004, the single was also released in the United Kingdom on an enhanced CD that included videos of live performances of \"Naughty Girl\" (2003) and \"Work it Out\" (2002). In Canada, a CD single was released on December 30, 2003, featuring the album version and two remixes of the track. A CD single was released in Australia on January 16, 2004, which included the radio edit and three remixes of the track. The song was also released as a maxi single on January 19, 2004 and later as a three-track single in Germany.\nAccording to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, \"Me, Myself and I\" is an R&B song performed in a moderately slow manner. It is written in the key of D\u266d major; the tempo is set to eighty-four beats per minute, in common time. The chord follows the E\u266dm\u2089-Fm\u2087-G\u266dMaj7 keys, appearing every other bar, and the song has a string arrangement.

Written, arranged and produced by himself, \"Again\" was initially set to be on his sixth studio album; however, Kravitz found out that the song didn't fit the tone of the album, releasing it instead as the lead single from the compilation on September 22, 2000, through Virgin Records. The mid-tempo rock ballad finds Kravitz wondering if he will ever see his former lover again and if they will reunite once more.\n\"Again\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who called it a magnificent and anthemic pounder. \"Again\" also won Kravitz a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 2001, a feat he had already achieved twice consecutively, with \"Fly Away\" and \"American Woman\". Commercially, the single reached number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Kravitz's first solo top-five hit in nearly nine years. \"Again\" was also successful internationally, topping the charts of Iceland and Italy, reaching number five in New Zealand, and becoming a top-10 hit in Austria, Croatia, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland. The song's music video was directed by Paul Hunter and stars Lenny and actress Gina Gershon as two-thirds of a romantic triangle.\nIn 1998, Lenny Kravitz released his fifth studio album, 5. The album received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the revitalization of his sound, but believed the album was not as enjoyable as his previous offerings. Despite the negative reviews, the album sold six million copies worldwide and spawned one of Kravitz's most successful singles, \"Fly Away\", which peaked inside the top 10 in many countries and topped the UK Singles Chart, While releasing 5's final single, \"Black Velveteen\", Kravitz announced the release of his first greatest hits album. Driven by the approach of the holiday shopping season, Virgin Records released the compilation featuring one new song, \"Again,\" and 14 old tracks. \"Again\" was one of the several tracks Kravitz wrote for his then-upcoming album, but he decided to release it separately, deciding it did not fit in with the album's tone. There was an aggressive media campaign for the release of the song utilizing the Internet. It was released on September 22, 2000, and was the most added song on the \"rock format\" during its first week on radio.\n\"Again\" was written, arranged and produced solely by Lenny Kravitz. According to the digital sheet music published by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of A major, and set in a moderately tempo of 84 beats per minute. Kravitz's vocals span from the low note of E3 to the high note of A4. Lyrically, \"Again\" details about losing contact with a past lover and wondering if they will ever encounter each other in the future to give the relationship another chance.\n\"Again\" received high praise from music critics. In his review for the Greatest Hits, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic selected the song as one of the album's highlights as well as calling the song \"magnificent\". Matthew S. Robinson of Music Dish wrote that the song is \"an anthemic pounder which, like so many of his other songs, is hook-heavy and a bit repetitive and for which Kravitz diligently handles much of the orchestration and performance himself.\" Rob Brunner of Entertainment Weekly was more critical with the song, calling it a \"ridiculous mid-tempo snooze\", where Kravitz \"sings like Bryan Adams and plays guitar like he's auditioning for a Journey tribute band.\"\n\"Again\" was nominated and eventually won a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, in its 43rd edition. By doing so, Kravitz managed to set a Grammy Award record, by having the most consecutive Grammys won for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance with \"Fly Away\" (1999), \"American Woman\" (2000), \"Again\" (2001) and later \"Dig In\" (2002). The song also entered VH1's list of \"25 Greatest Power Ballads\" at number 13.\n\"Again\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 72, becoming the \"Hot Shot Debut\" of the week ending November 18, 2000. The song entered the top-ten nine weeks later, on the edition of January 20, 2001, climbing from number 11 to number 9, becoming his second top-ten single. On the issue of February 10, 2001, \"Again\" climbed to number 5, with a gain of 5 million listeners, becoming the most-played song in the country. The song went on to peak higher a week later, climbing to number 4, becoming its peak position for four consecutive weeks. It became Kravitz's most successful song in nearly nine years, the last being"

Produced by Trevor Horn, it was released as the lead single from the album on 27 August 2010 in most countries worldwide and on 1 October in the United Kingdom. \"Shame\" marks the first time Williams and Barlow collaborated on a song together solely and the first time they worked together since Williams left Take That in 1995. It is a pop song with country and folk music influences; two reviewers noted that it contains an acoustic guitar part similar to the one of the Beatles' 1968 song, \"Blackbird\". The lyrical content revolves around singers' broken relationship and fixing things up.\n\"Shame\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics who praised the song's sound, melody, and lyrical skills of the performers. It reached the top-ten in seven countries worldwide including Hungary, Netherlands, Italy and Denmark. In the singers' native United Kingdom, it peaked at number two on the singles chart and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), denoting shipments of over 200,000 copies in the country. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Vaughan Arnell in Los Angeles and premiered on 26 August 2010. It features Williams and Barlow dancing and singing the song in a bar and fishing on a pond. Multiple critics linked the storyline and the pair's chemistry in the video to the 2005 film, Brokeback Mountain. To further promote \"Shame\", the pair performed it on multiple occasions including on the Help for Heroes concert and Strictly Come Dancing.\nIn July 1995, Williams announced that he was leaving Take That, a boy band in which both he and Barlow were members. Following Williams's departure, the group disbanded until 2005 when Take That announced their reunion. After 13 years, in 2008, during the band's work on their fifth studio album, The Circus, Barlow and Williams met for the first time since the latter left the band. In 2010, in an interview on BBC Radio 1, Williams elaborated, \"'It is one of those situations in life that could be very explosive and could go completely wrong. We had that big chat and the most amazing thing happened at the end of it. We both said sorry to each other and we both meant it and that was all we needed.\" Barlow added, \"I spent the last 15 years thinking about what I was going to say.\"\n\"Shame\" was written by Barlow and Williams for Williams's second greatest hits album, In and Out of Consciousness: Greatest Hits 1990\u20132010 (2010). In February 2010, the single was composed and written in an hour, in an empty recording studio located in Los Angeles; it was inspired by their past troubled relationship. English musician Trevor Horn produced \"Shame\" whilst Tim Weidner and Graham Archer did the engineering of the track; Dave Miles served as an additional engineer. Weidner also provided the mixing of the song. All of its mastering was done at the Metropolis Studios in London and the Gateway Mastering in Portland, Maine.\n\"Shame\" was released as the lead and only single from In and Out of Consciousness: Greatest Hits 1990\u20132010. It was made available for digital download via the iTunes Store on 27 August 2010 in some countries, including Australia, Denmark, Germany and Italy. In singers's native United Kingdom it was placed for digital purchase over a month later on 1 October. On 4 October, Virgin Records released a CD single of \"Shame\" in the UK; apart from the title track, the single featured another song performed by Williams, titled \"The Queen\".\n\"Shame\" is a pop song with a length of three minutes fifty-nine seconds. According to Faber Music's digital sheet music for the song, \"Shame\" is composed in the key of Bb major and set in common time signature, and has a moderately slow groove of 96 beats per minute. The singers's vocals span from the low note of B\u2083 to the high note of B\u2085. Michael Cragg of The Guardian noted that the single features country music influences and an \"electro-tinged\" chorus, reminiscent of the works of British producer Stuart Price. Digital Spy's Mayer Nissim noted that \"Shame\" contains an acoustic guitar part which is"

On September 17, 2002, RCA released it as a double-A side with \"A Moment Like This\" as her coronation single after winning the first season of American Idol.  A remixed version of the song was later included on her debut studio album, Thankful (2003). It went on to become the best-selling single of 2002 in the United States.\n\"Before Your Love\" was written and produced by Desmond Child and Cathy Dennis for the winner of the inaugural season of American Idol. Kelly Clarkson, Justin Guarini, Nikki McKibbin, and Tamyra Gray each recorded a version of the song in case one of them won the season. It was first performed live by Clarkson and Guarini during the final showdown of American Idol at the Kodak Theatre on September 3, 2002. It was then performed by Clarkson during the grand finale on September 4, 2002 before winning the title. It was released as a double-A single with \"A Moment Like This\" on September 17, 2002. It was also one of the few songs to be released as a DVD single in the early 2000s. Clarkson included the song in the setlist for the American Idol Tour in 2002. A music video of the song premiered on MTV as her first music video in September 2002.\n\nThe song has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a \"D+\" rating, he remarked \"The lyrics are generalized banalities (I never lived before your love/I never felt before your touch), the melodies destined to endure as wedding songs or florist ads. A choir at the end of \"A Moment Like This\" is meant to indicate earthiness; the gentle acoustic guitar throughout \"Before Your Love,\" sensitivity.\" Rito Asilo of the Philippine Daily Inquirer remarked that the song's lyrics were \"corny,\" but praised Clarkson's voice. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote: \"Yes, the girl's got immeasurable talent, but the last note of Thankful's final track, a new mix of \"Before Your Love,\" speaks volumes: this is the sound of strained excess.\"\nThe song became a commercial success throughout North America, establishing Clarkson as a hit singer. Along with \"A Moment Like This\", \"Before Your Love\" entered the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 52. The following week it ascended to number one, fueled by sales of over 236,000 copies, making it the first single to sell more than 200,000 copies since 1999. Its ascent broke the record set by the British band The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one after their single \"Can't Buy Me Love\" rose from number 27 to number one in April 1964. That record was later broken by the American pop rock band Maroon 5 when \"Makes Me Wonder\" rose from number 64 to number one in May 2007. Clarkson would later break it again when her single \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" rose from number 97 to number one in February 2009. Despite being commercially successful, it received minimal radio airplay in favor of \"A Moment Like This\". It was later certified gold by the RIAA and double platinum by Music Canada.\nThe music video to the song begins with Clarkson returning to her home after her win on American Idol. She sits in her bedroom before getting ready for a date with her boyfriend. Driving her home from her date, her boyfriend surprises her with a house party in her backyard with friends and family celebrating her American Idol win.

It is the fourth song on the band's third and final studio album, In Utero, released in September 1993. It is also Nirvana's last single release before Cobain committed suicide in 1994.\n\"Rape Me\" was released as the album's second single in December 1993, packaged as a double A-side with \"All Apologies\". The single reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\"Rape Me\" was written by Cobain on an acoustic guitar in Los Angeles in May 1991, around the time the band's second album, Nevermind, was being mixed. It was first performed live on June 18, 1991, at The Catalyst in Santa Cruz. The earliest live versions of the song featured a guitar solo instead of a bridge.\nThe song's lyrics led to controversy even before it had been officially released. The band had wanted to play \"Rape Me\" during their appearance at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, but the network believed the song was a direct attack on them, and insisted they perform their breakthrough single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" instead. The ongoing argument between MTV and Cobain escalated over the span of several days, with MTV threatening to cut Nirvana from the show, to stop playing the band's music videos, and even to boycott other artists on the band's management company, Gold Mountain. Cobain only relented after being informed that MTV would fire Amy Finnerty, an MTV employee and friend of the band's, if the band played \"Rape Me\". The band ultimately agreed to play their latest single, \"Lithium,\" but not before Cobain started playing the chords and singing the opening lines of \"Rape Me,\" which resulted in the live broadcast almost going to commercial.\n\"Rape Me\" was first recorded in the studio in October 1992, during a two-day demo session with Jack Endino at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington. Two takes of the song were recorded, one of which was instrumental, the other featuring lead vocals by Cobain and backing vocals by drummer Dave Grohl. Cobain was holding his then-infant daughter Frances Bean Cobain on his lap when he recorded his vocals, and she can be heard crying on the demo.\nThe final studio version of \"Rape Me\" was recorded in February 1993 by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, for the band's third and final studio album, In Utero. The instruments for the song were recorded on February 15. The following day, Cobain completed his vocals for the album during a reported six-hour session. Cobain used his Fender Jaguar guitar plugged into a Twin Reverb amp.\nOn September 25, 1993, the band performed the song, along with \"Heart-Shaped Box,\" on Saturday Night Live at NBC Studios in New York City. It was the band's first show with second guitarist Pat Smear. The song was again performed on television on February 4, 1994 for the show Nulle Part Ailleurs in Paris, France.\nThe final live performance of \"Rape Me\" was at Nirvana's last concert at Terminal 1 of Munich-Riem Airport on March 1, 1994.\n\nThe song's instrumental opening bars, which features Cobain using pick scratching while playing the verse chord progression, has led to frequent comparisons to the guitar riff of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Will Bryant of Pitchfork wrote that \"the four-chord riff that drags the song through the motions is an almost direct inversion of the famous 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' riff,\" while Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross described the song as having \"the same catchy soft/loud dynamic as \"Teen Spirit,\" which \"created a perfect Cobain aesthetic \u2013 beautiful, haunting and disturbing.\" \"Rape Me\" was written after \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" but before Nevermind had been released.\n\"Rape Me\" is an anti-rape song, written from the point of view of the victim. \"It's like she's saying, 'Rape me, go ahead, rape me, beat me,'\" Cobain told Darcey Steinke of Spin in 1993, \"'You'll never kill me. I'll survive this and I'm gonna fucking rape you one of these days and you won't even know it.'\" Gillian G. Garr described the song's lyrics as \"part submissive invitation, part"

It was commissioned for the soundtrack of the 2013 film The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, where it was played over the closing credits. The Hobbit director, Peter Jackson, asked Sheeran to write a song for the movie after Jackson's daughter, Katie, suggested Sheeran. Sheeran saw the film, wrote the song, and recorded most of the track elements on the same day.\nThe song was released as a digital download on 5 November 2013. Its music video was released the same day. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 13 and reached number one in New Zealand on its sixth week, Sheeran's first number-one single there. \"I See Fire\" was nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Original Song.\n\"I See Fire\" plays over the first section of the closing credits of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, an epic fantasy adventure film directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson. Released on 13 December 2013, it is the second installment in the three-part film series based on the novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien. The Hobbit follows the quest of a home-loving hobbit, a fictional, diminutive humanoid, to win a share of the treasure guarded by the dragon, Smaug.\nSheeran has a lifelong devotion to the novel of Tolkien. His grandfather owns a first edition copy. It was the first book Sheeran's father read to him as a child, and the first book that he read himself. On 5 November 2013, Sheeran announced his involvement in the soundtrack in a series of online posts, which included his thanking Jackson for the opportunity. He is also a fan of Jackson's films.\nJackson was introduced to Sheeran's music by his daughter, Katie, who attended Sheeran's concert in Wellington, New Zealand, in March 2013. Jackson, having learned Sheeran's regard toward his films, met him over lunch the following day where they exchanged email addresses.\nIn late 2013, Jackson and Fran Walsh, who co-produced and co-wrote the film, were searching for an artist who would write and record the song. Following Katie's advice, they decided to tap Sheeran. Jackson sent a message to Sheeran, who was in the Mediterranean island of Ibiza attending a wedding ceremony, asking if he would be interested in the project, which Sheeran accepted. Departing from London, Sheeran and his manager, Stuart, arrived in Wellington within 48 hours.\nSheeran watched the film at an early screening in Park Road Post, a film post-production facility located in Wellington, New Zealand. Jackson advised Sheeran to focus on the film's ending: \"Focus on the last 10 minutes. That's what the song needs to reflect[. ...] Write a song that takes the audience by the hand and leads them from Middle-earth back into reality.\" Capturing his reaction to watching the film, Sheeran immediately began writing the lyrics \"from the perspective of being a dwarf\". Jackson required a folk song and Sheeran, who is \"known for songs that wouldn't fit in a Hobbit film\", attempted to follow in that direction.\nSheeran wrote and recorded, in only one day, most of the elements present in the released version. Further revisions were made in a course of three days that Sheeran stayed in the facility. Sheeran revealed he was given complete freedom in the creative process, while receiving ready inputs from Jackson and his co-filmmakers. In particular, Sheeran notes: \"[Jackson] knows the colors and templates of what the song should be rather than how the melody should go.\"\nSheeran also produced the song, playing all the instruments except for the cello. Despite having never played the violin, he chose to perform it himself through overdubbing. Flight of the Conchords' touring cellist Nigel Collins added cello parts as dictated by Sheeran. Pete Cobbin of Abbey Road Studios mixed \"I See Fire\"; Cobbin was at Park Road Post at the same time, responsible for mixing the musical score of The Desolation of Smaug.\n\"I See Fire\" is a folk ballad, characterized with gently strummed acoustic guitar. Sheeran revealed he took inspiration from the 1970s Irish folk band Planxty. According to Entertainment Weekly's Jodi Walker, the song is \"touch reminiscent\" of \"The Parting Glass\", an Irish traditional song that is a bonus track in Sheeran's debut album, +. The themes in The Hobbit are present in the song's lyrics, which refer to \"fire, mountains and brotherhood\".\n\"I See Fire\" was released on 5 November 2013 through iTunes, initially in the United States and then worldwide within the next 36 hours. It was later released on 10 December 2013 as part of"

Written by Sheeran and Benny Blanco and produced by Blanco and Rick Rubin, the song samples \"Don't Mess with My Man\" by Lucy Pearl. It was initially planned as the album's lead single, but was passed over in favour of \"Sing\". It was instead released to iTunes on 13 June 2014 as the second \"instant grat\" promotional single from \u00d7. \"Don't\" officially impacted US contemporary hit radio on 15 July 2014 and was released independently on 24 August 2014 as the album's second single.\n\"Don't\" peaked at No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart. In the US, it became Sheeran's first top 10 single. It also made the top 10 in eight other countries.\nThe song developed from a riff which Sheeran had on his phone for a year. Sheeran first recorded the track with producer Benny Blanco, who was also credited as co-writer under his real name, Benjamin Levin. Sheeran recorded it again with Rick Rubin. The two producers produced the final cut. \"Don't\" is an R&B song with a \"blue-eyed soul hymn\".\nThe lyrics consist of three verses, which Sheeran elaborated: \"The first verse is the setup, the second explains the situation, and the third is the outcome, with a chorus in between each.\" A lyrical screed, it alludes to events attendant to the short-lived relationship Sheeran had with another singer. He sings: \"For me and her, we make money the same way/ Four cities, two planes in the same day.\" Sheeran scorned the former girl for having sex with another guy, and expressed an expletive such as in the line \"Don't fuck with my love\". Sheeran revealed he wrote the song out of frustration, and, story-wise, the lyrics are self-explanatory. He recalled the events that inspired his writing: \"[...] it was one of those situations where someone comes across as a very, very sweet, innocent person, and you take that for granted, then stuff unravels and you see a different side to them.\" The song was therapeutic because writing it made him feel better afterwards.\nAbout his other songs, Sheeran has openly stated who inspired the lyrical content. But since the release of \"Don't\", he had remained silent to whom the song is directed to.  In a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone, Sheeran articulated that he had dated a few singers, but his friend Taylor Swift was not among them, and in fact, he played the track for her. The same interview mentions tabloids that have linked Sheeran with Ellie Goulding and Selena Gomez. On 31 October 2015, Fuse posted an interview in which Sheeran says, \"'Don't' is just a song that\u2019s close to the bone and definitely opened up a door that I probably shouldn't have opened up. [...] I just won't say who it's about because... I mean everyone, everyone fucking knows anyway. But like I just won't say who it's about cause it's quite a negative song.\"\n\"Don't\" is written in the key of F minor with a tempo of 92 beats per minute.\nSheeran did not intend to release the song on the album, because the lyrics were therapeutic and personal. He was however persuaded by those who had heard the song to release it, as it was \"an alright song\". He revealed that \"the more [he] listened back [he] thought this is an alright song\".\n\"Don't\" was planned to be released as the first single from the album until March 2014, when \"Sing\" was chosen. Billboard speculated that the provocative, \"Don't fuck with my love\", chorus prompted the change. Sheeran debuted a snippet of the song in a commercial for Beats by Dr. Dre in May 2014.\nOn 13 June 2014, \"Don't\" was made available to customers, who pre-ordered \u00d7, as the second \"instant grat\" promotional single, following \"One\", and an official audio stream was released on Sheeran's YouTube page. An extended play accompanied the release of the single, featuring a remix by Rick Ross, a live cover of Nina Simone's \"Be My Husband\", and a non-album song, \"Everything You Are\". Notably, Sheeran's lyrics aren't censored on the Rick Ross remix, but are on the album version. \"Don't\" officially impacted US contemporary hit radio on 15 July 2014.\nJason Lipshutz of Billboard wrote: \"[...] 'Don't' shows that Sheeran is not afraid to be dangerous, or even explicit, on his sophomore set.\"\nIn the UK, the song reached No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart on its ninth week on the chart. As of September 2017, the song sold 399,000 copies in actual sales, and it also has 67 million streams, giving a total of 1,073,000 combined units in the UK.\nIn the US, \"Don't\" reached No. 9 on the all-encompassing Billboard Hot 100 chart; it marked Sheeran's first single to reach"

Ballerini co-wrote the song with Josh Kerr, Forest Glen Whitehead and Lance Carpenter. It was released on July 8, 2014 as Ballerini's debut single and the lead single from her debut studio album, The First Time, released on May 19, 2015, by Black River Entertainment. The song is about a young woman showing interest in a man.\n\"Love Me Like You Mean It\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, making Ballerini the first solo female to top that chart with her debut single since Carrie Underwood's \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\" in 2006 and the first female country music artist to accomplish that on an independent label. It also charted at number five on the Hot Country Songs chart and number 45 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 596,000 units in the US as of May 2016. It achieved similar chart success in Canada, peaking at number three on the Canada Country chart and number 61 on the Canadian Hot 100. It garnered a Gold certification from Music Canada, denoting sales of 40,000 units in that country.\nThe accompanying music video for the song, directed by Kristin Barlowe, was shot in Nashville and features Ballerini playing party games outside with her friends and performing throughout various locations.\nThe song is a mid-tempo country pop song that, according to the digital sheet music published by Hal Leonard Music Publishing, is composed in the key of E major, in cut time with a primary chord pattern of E\u2013B\u2013F\u266fm7add4\u2013A\u209b\u1d64\u209b2. Ballerini's vocal ranges one octave, from B\u2083 to B\u2084. Natalie Wiener of Billboard called \"Love Me Like You Mean It\" a song \"about being a young woman who's openly expressing interest in a man,\" making the song a subtle message of feminism. She compared the song's opening line, \"Oh hey, boy with your hat back/Mmm I kind of like that/if you wanna walk my way,\" to Carly Rae Jepsen's 2012 hit, \"Call Me Maybe\".\n\nTaste of Country reviewed the single favorably, saying that \"Ballerini mixes modern production techniques with a straight-up country message to create an identifiable country-pop blend.\" In 2017, Billboard contributor Chuck Dauphin placed \"Love Me Like You Mean It\" at number one on his top 10 list of Ballerini's best songs.\n\"Love Me Like You Mean It\" debuted at number 60 on the US Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of October 18, 2014, and debuted at number 48 on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of December 13, 2014. It reached number one on the Country Airplay chart for the week of July 4, 2015, making Ballerini the first solo female to send her debut single to the top of that chart since Carrie Underwood did with \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\" in 2006; it also made her the first female country music artist to do so on an independent label. The song was certified Gold by the RIAA on July 14, 2015 and certified Platinum on August 4, 2016. The song has sold 596,000 copies in the US as of May 2016. In Canada, the song reached the top three of the Canada Country chart and peaked at number 61 on the Canadian Hot 100. It was certified Gold by Music Canada on September 12, 2016.\nAn acoustic music video was directed by Robert Chavers and premiered in November 2014. The official music video, directed by Kristin Barlowe, was filmed in Nashville and premiered in March 2015. In it, Ballerini is seen playing games like musical chairs and Twister with her friends outside, while performing the song from various locations inside a trailer and in the doorway of a house.\nThe video was nominated at the 2015 CMT Music Awards in the category of Breakthrough Video of the Year, but lost to Sam Hunt's \"Leave the Night On\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWard, Jaimie (July 13, 2014). \"\"Love Me Like You Mean It\" The Debut Single By Kelsea Ballerini Is Digitally Available Now\".

It was written by Underwood, Hillary Lindsey, and David Hodges. It was released as the fourth and final single from Underwood's fourth studio album, Blown Away, on April 15, 2013. Underwood announced the single on her official Twitter account.\nUnderwood debuted the song on the twelfth season of American Idol on April 4, 2013. \"See You Again\" is Underwood's eighteenth consecutive Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and is also her seventeenth single to be certified at least Gold by the RIAA. As of December 2013, the single has sold 740,000 copies in the United States. On August 10, 2015, \"See You Again\" was officially certified as Platinum.\n\"See You Again\" tells the story of moving onwards after experiencing the death of a loved one in life. The lyrics provide hope and promise through Underwood's belief that one will reunite with every fallen loved one in the afterlife. The song's opening consists of a solo piano, followed by a backing chorus and band kicking in shortly after.\n\"See You Again\" was originally one of three songs written for the 2010 feature film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Of the three songs that Underwood, Hodges, and Lindsey co-wrote for the film, the workers behind the project opted to choose \"There's a Place For Us.\" Underwood pushed to include \"See You Again\" on her fourth studio album, Blown Away, during the writing process of the album.\nSee You Again is written in the key of A-flat major, with a vocal range from F3 to D\u266d5.\nThe song has received positive reviews from music critics. Billboard.com described the song to be \"truly a taste of heaven.\" Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe included the song in his personal favorite tracks from the Blown Away studio album in the website's 2012 year-end countdown of editors' favorite Country albums of the year, as did Matt Bjorke of Roughstock for their album countdown. Liv Carter of Urban Country News gave the song a \"thumbs up\", adding \"what pulls it over the line however, and presumably why it has become a fan-favorite, is its sincerity in wishing to bring comfort and Underwood\u2019s confident performance.\" Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was less favorable, saying that \"the chorus of power ballad \"See You Again\" is marred by dated, campy arena-rock clich\u00e9s.\"\nThe song debuted at No. 60 on the US Country Airplay chart for the week of April 13, 2013, and peaked at No. 2 for the chart dated September 7, 2013.  It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 90 for the chart dated May 18, 2013, and peaked at No. 34 for the chart of August 31, 2013.  It also peaked at No.7 on the Hot Country Songs chart on August 24, 2013.  As of December 2013, the single has sold 740,000 copies in the United States.\nOn August 10, 2015 \"See You Again\" was officially certified as Platinum.\n\n\n\nOn June 7, 2013, Good Morning America gave a first look for the music video for \"See You Again\". The full video premiered soon after on ABCNews.com. The music video was directed by Eric Welch. It showed the aftermaths of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the September 11 attacks and the 2013 Moore, Oklahoma, tornado, along with various reunions.\nDigital download\n\"See You Again\" \u2013 4:07\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Twitter - @carrieunderwood: Ok...I am so excited to announce...\" twitter.com.

Ballerini co-wrote the song with Josh Kerr, Forest Glen Whitehead and Lance Carpenter. It was released on July 8, 2014 as Ballerini's debut single and the lead single from her debut studio album, The First Time, released on May 19, 2015, by Black River Entertainment. The song is about a young woman showing interest in a man.\n\"Love Me Like You Mean It\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, making Ballerini the first solo female to top that chart with her debut single since Carrie Underwood's \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\" in 2006 and the first female country music artist to accomplish that on an independent label. It also charted at number five on the Hot Country Songs chart and number 45 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 596,000 units in the US as of May 2016. It achieved similar chart success in Canada, peaking at number three on the Canada Country chart and number 61 on the Canadian Hot 100. It garnered a Gold certification from Music Canada, denoting sales of 40,000 units in that country.\nThe accompanying music video for the song, directed by Kristin Barlowe, was shot in Nashville and features Ballerini playing party games outside with her friends and performing throughout various locations.\nThe song is a mid-tempo country pop song that, according to the digital sheet music published by Hal Leonard Music Publishing, is composed in the key of E major, in cut time with a primary chord pattern of E\u2013B\u2013F\u266fm7add4\u2013A\u209b\u1d64\u209b2. Ballerini's vocal ranges one octave, from B\u2083 to B\u2084. Natalie Wiener of Billboard called \"Love Me Like You Mean It\" a song \"about being a young woman who's openly expressing interest in a man,\" making the song a subtle message of feminism. She compared the song's opening line, \"Oh hey, boy with your hat back/Mmm I kind of like that/if you wanna walk my way,\" to Carly Rae Jepsen's 2012 hit, \"Call Me Maybe\".\n\nTaste of Country reviewed the single favorably, saying that \"Ballerini mixes modern production techniques with a straight-up country message to create an identifiable country-pop blend.\" In 2017, Billboard contributor Chuck Dauphin placed \"Love Me Like You Mean It\" at number one on his top 10 list of Ballerini's best songs.\n\"Love Me Like You Mean It\" debuted at number 60 on the US Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of October 18, 2014, and debuted at number 48 on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of December 13, 2014. It reached number one on the Country Airplay chart for the week of July 4, 2015, making Ballerini the first solo female to send her debut single to the top of that chart since Carrie Underwood did with \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\" in 2006; it also made her the first female country music artist to do so on an independent label. The song was certified Gold by the RIAA on July 14, 2015 and certified Platinum on August 4, 2016. The song has sold 596,000 copies in the US as of May 2016. In Canada, the song reached the top three of the Canada Country chart and peaked at number 61 on the Canadian Hot 100. It was certified Gold by Music Canada on September 12, 2016.\nAn acoustic music video was directed by Robert Chavers and premiered in November 2014. The official music video, directed by Kristin Barlowe, was filmed in Nashville and premiered in March 2015. In it, Ballerini is seen playing games like musical chairs and Twister with her friends outside, while performing the song from various locations inside a trailer and in the doorway of a house.\nThe video was nominated at the 2015 CMT Music Awards in the category of Breakthrough Video of the Year, but lost to Sam Hunt's \"Leave the Night On\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWard, Jaimie (July 13, 2014). \"\"Love Me Like You Mean It\" The Debut Single By Kelsea Ballerini Is Digitally Available Now\".

It was released on November 9, 2018, as the second single from DNA, their ninth studio album (eighth in the United States). The song was written by Shawn Mendes, Fiona Bevan, Casey Smith, Geoff Warburton, Scott Harris, and producers Ryan Tedder, and Zach Skelton. \"Chances\" peaked at number nine on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, and number 19 on the Adult Top 40. An accompanying music video was directed by McLean and Ren\u00e9 Elizondo Jr., and depicts two dancers performing inside Union Station.\nAJ McLean first met Ryan Tedder in 2003, where they worked together on the Backstreet Boys' 2009 studio album This Is Us and the former musician's debut studio album Have It All (2010). After several years, McLean suggested Tedder to send several of his written songs to the Backstreet Boys. One of the songs included \"Chances\", which the band immediately gravitated towards. The song was written by Shawn Mendes, Fiona Bevan, Casey Smith, Geoff Warburton, Scott Harris, and producers Tedder, and Zach Skelton. The song and accompanying music video were simultaneously released on November 9, 2018, which followed the announcement of the DNA World Tour.\n\"Chances\" is a pop song. Fist-pumping synthesizers are consistently used, as the Backstreet Boys ponder over the chorus, \"What are the chances that we'd end up dancing? Like 2 in a million, like once in a life\". In an interview with Billboard in 2018, McLean explained that \"Chances\" was similar to their previous 2018 single, \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\", but acknowledged that it also felt distinct. He described the lyrics as \"more of that realistic love story about chance, to find that person in the most precarious of scenarios\". However, Backstreet Boys member Brian Littrell stated that \"both songs are completely different\" in a 2019 interview with Entertainment Weekly.\nMike Wass of Idolator described \"Chances\" as \"another irresistible, vaguely retro pop-anthem\" containing perfect vocal harmonies. Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic praised \"Chances\" and \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\", stating that both songs are \"some of Backstreet's finest, familiar in their delivery yet with a finger on the mainstream pulse of 2019\". Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan stated that the song was \"plaintively throbbing\". Josh Hurst of Flood Magazine referred to \"Chances\" as \"slightly anthemic\", but not jarring.\n\"Chances\" peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 on November 24, 2018. The song also reached number nine on the US Dance Club Songs on the chart dated March 9, 2019, as well as number 19 on the Adult Top 40 chart dated January 26, 2019. \"Chances\" peaked on the Canadian Hot 100 at number 55, and was certified gold by Music Canada (MC) for selling over 40,000 equivalent-sales units in Canada. The single charted at number 63 on the Official German Charts, and at number 82 on the Schweizer Hitparade in Switzerland.\n\nThe music video was released simultaneously with the digital release of the song on November 9, 2018. It was co-directed by McLean and Ren\u00e9 Elizondo Jr., which was the first video McLean directed for the Backstreet Boys. The music video was filmed inside Union Station in Los Angeles, while it was still open to the public, and was the first time all five members wore suits during a music video. Elizondo wanted the video to be cinematic and showcase elements of film noir.\nShooting lasted from 2:00pm to 4:00am on September 4, 2019. The dancers featured in the video are Madison Vomastek and Jake Tribus, both students from the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance at the University of Southern California. They were filmed from 3:00pm to 5:00pm, while the Backstreet Boys were designated inside of the train carriage at 3:00am. Both Vomastek and Tribus performed an uninterrupted choreographed sequence that was praised by both the band, their label, and management. As of December 2019, it has over 28 million views on YouTube.\nThe video begins as a woman runs down the steps of a train station in a Steadicam shot. She helps another woman pick up a bag that she dropped, as a man in front of her misses the train. As she continues to walk by, the man follows her throughout the station until they sit opposite each other on the station seats. The duo perform a"

The song was released to radio stations and as a digital download in Sweden on August 11, 2008. The song is written by Anders Hansson and is released by Roxy Recordings.\nJust like \"Release Me\" a French version of the song was recorded for the francophone market called \"On se Donne\". \"On and On\" was released in the UK in May, 2010. The song was re-released in the Netherlands on May 24, 2010 as the UK edit.\n\"On and On\" was first heard at the Swedish television show \"Sommarkrysset\" at TV4 August 16, 2008. It was the song that announced her comeback after leaving Sony Music and being signed to independent label Roxy Recordings, the song was released as a single the same week and after spending a massive 26 weeks on the Swedish Top 60 Singles Chart it was surely considered one of the smash-hits of Sweden the summer of 2008. Since its international release the song has been remade and remixed numerous times, the first remix was the Danish DK Radio Edit which was released as the second single in Denmark. Though it failed to chart, the original edit from the album managed to peak at 16 at the Danish Singles Chart. When to be released all over Europe another edit was made called the  \"Moonwalker Version\". Also this edit managed to enter many charts all over the continent and in France a French version was recorded, \"On se Donne\".\nAfter \"I Need You Now\" did not meet the expectations in the UK \"On and On\" was chosen as the third single. The UK edit was first heard on Friday March 26 on BBC Radio 1's Floorfillers with Scott Mills.\nLeanne Durr of \"ClickLiverpool\" called \"On and On\" too Europop and that it would fit as Sweden's Eurovision entry, despight this he says that the song have one major good point, Agnes's voice, which is \"mature beyond its years\". She also said that \"if Agnes is looking for any credibility within the dance genre, she should steer clear of this euro-pop sound as it is nowhere near as edgy or as sleek as previous single Release Me.\"\nIn contrast, Jessica Pinkett of \"Daily Music Guide\" stated that with \"On and On\" Agnes was \"back on top form\" after \"the disappointingly bland 'I Need You Now'\". She described On and On as \"a catchy, upbeat number which is made all the more anthemic by Agnes' belting diva vocals\" and suggested that it could become one of 2010's major summer dance hits.\nA similar opinion was brought by \"Entertainment-focus.com\" who said that \"On and On is in a similar vein to Agnes\u2019 previous singles. With Europop beats and dance rhythms the song is aimed squarely at the clubs. A better offering than I Need You Now, the song could catch on in the pre-Summer charts as people get ready for their holidays in the sun or nights out on the town. Agnes\u2019 strong vocals sets the song aside from others in the same genre and we really hope she can find another smash-hit with this track. Though they say that \"On and On\" probably won't enter the top-ten chart, it is better than other dance pop, such as Cascada.\nSince the song premiered for the first time in Sweden 2008, three music videos has been filmed.\nThe first one was produced for the Swedish and Dutch market and had premier on MSN Video one week ahead of the singles official release in Sweden. It was directed by Anders Rune, who also directed the video for Agnes first international single \"Release Me\". The video was the most shown music video on MSN Video ever. The video was recorded in a suburb to Stockholm during the summer of 2008.\nA new music video was filmed to accompany the international release of \"On and On\". The video was recorded in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden on July 12 and 13, 2009. The video was directed by Torbj\u00f6rn Martin and produced by Bj\u00f6rn F\u00e4vremark for STARK production. It premiered on STARK's homepage on September 21, 2009. The video features Agnes alone in numerous different outfits and settings. Most of the video is computer-animated and shows Agnes dancing in front of a light-blue background while confetti or moving white lines surrounds her. Other scenes shows Agnes under water or in front of two giant spotlights.\nIn January 2010 Agnes's official website confirmed that a third video was to be made for the UK market. Also this one was filmed in G\u00f6teborg and produced by \"STARK\". The video premiered on March 1, 2010 on AllAroundTheWorld's official YouTube-channel, though it was supposed to be released two weeks earlier. The delay has"

It was written and produced by Furtado and Rick Nowels. The song was first released 30 July 2007 as the album's fifth and final single in the United Kingdom and was later released in various formats across Europe in the fall of 2007. Furtado recorded a new version of the song as a duet with Australian country singer Keith Urban the following year, which was released to North America in April 2008.\n\"In God's Hands\" achieved only moderate success, becoming her lowest-charting single from Loose in every European country in which it was promoted. Following the song's North American re-release in 2008, however, \"In God's Hands\" reached its peak at number 11 on the Canadian Hot 100, earning Furtado her second highest-charting single to date since the chart's inception in 2007, and also peaked at a career-high position of 15 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.\nA country/pop song, \"In God's Hands\" is inspired by Furtado's 2005 breakup with DJ Jasper Gahunia, the father of her daughter. According to Furtado, the song was, at the time of its recording, \"as far as [she] was willing to go in terms of pop right now\".\nLyrically, the song is about moving on and starting anew, with Furtado declaring in the chorus, \"Our love's floating up in the sky in heaven/ Where it began, back in God's hands.\" Her vocal style on the song has been described as \"pretty.\"\nFurtado also recorded a Spanish version, titled \"En las manos de Dios\", which appears in a Spanish limited edition of Loose.\nIn early 2008, Furtado re-recorded \"In God's Hands\" as a duet featuring New Zealand country music singer Keith Urban, who was reportedly Furtado's \"first choice.\" On her rationale behind the selection, Furtado said, \"I love country music. Keith Urban's voice is plaintive and sweet; he's a pure songsmith, with an extremely humble tone to his voice... He's right on the border of country, roots and pop. He really defies description, and those are my favorite kinds of artists.\"\nSean Fennessey of Pitchfork criticized the songwriting on the chorus and wrote that, \"If \"Promiscuous\" is one of the fiercest songs of lust in recent memory, \"In God's Hands\" is one of the limpest.\" Jonathan Keefe of Slant was more ambivalent, praising Furtado's vocals but maligning the song's inclusion on Loose. \"While \"In God's Hands\" is one of the first times in her career that Furtado's voice could... be described as pretty,\" writes Keefe, \"the song itself... simply doesn't fit with the first two-thirds of the album.\"\n\"In God's Hands\" debuted and peaked at number 116 on the UK Singles Chart dated 11 August 2007. It was the first single of Furtado's career (that was promoted to the United Kingdom) to miss the top 100. Elsewhere in Europe, the song performed moderately well. It reached a peak position at number 53 in Austria, number 33 in Germany, number 20 in Italy, number 33 in the Netherlands, and number 58 in Sweden. \"In God's Hands\" also reached number 9 and number 22, respectively, on the Flanders and Wallonian Ultratip Bubbling Under charts.\nThe 2008 duet version of the song debuted at number 11 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart dated 3 May 2008 and was the week's highest debut. This tied it with \"Say It Right\" as Furtado's second highest-charting single to date in her native country since the creation of the Canadian Hot 100 chart in 2007. \"In God's Hands\" also reached number seven on the Digital Songs component chart dated 3 May 2008. The song spent a total of 16 weeks on the Canadian Hot 100. In the United States, \"In God's Hands\" entered the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart dated 26 April 2008 at number 25 and was the week's highest debut. On the chart dated 21 June 2008, the song rose to number 18, breaking out of a tie with \"Say It Right\" for Furtado's highest-charting adult contemporary single to date. It reached its peak at number 15 on the chart dated 26 July 2008.\nA music video for the song was shot on 9 May 2007 between 5 and 7 a.m. in Los Angeles, California and directed by Jesse Dylan. It features Furtado on a beach during both daytime and nighttime, singing the song while sitting on a tree stump, lying on the sand and holding a white sheet, which she lies under. Furtado is also shown walking on the shore, weeping and looking onto the ocean. The video is shot entirely in black and white. It was made available on Furtado's Vevo channel 12"

It was released to American country radio by Black River Entertainment as the third single from her debut studio album The First Time (2015). Ballerini co-wrote the song with Forest Glen Whitehead and Jesse Lee. The track is a country pop ballad about a lost love being compared to the song's namesake as a metaphor for being immature and having a tendency to run off to his own fantasy.\n\"Peter Pan\" peaked at number one on both the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts respectively, becoming Ballerini's first to hit the top of the former, and her third consecutive on the latter chart. It makes her the first female country music artist to top both country music charts at the same time. It also made her the first female country artist since Wynonna Judd in 1992 to send their first three singles to number one. It also charted at number 35 on the Hot 100. The song was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 672,000 copies in the US as of March 2017. It achieved similar chart prominence in Canada, peaking at number four on the Canada Country chart and number 75 on the Canadian Hot 100. It garnered a Gold certification from Music Canada, denoting sales of 40,000 units in that country.\nAn accompanying music video for the song, directed by Kristin Barlowe, features Ballerini watching in terror as her boyfriend does thrill-seeking stunts in cars, motorcycles, and planes out in the Las Vegas desert. It was nominated for Video of the Year at both the 2017 Academy of Country Music and CMT Music Awards. For promotion, Ballerini first performed the song live with Nick Jonas at the Academy of Country Music Awards and would make later appearances at the 2016 Radio Disney Music Awards with Daya, Live with Kelly and Michael, the Grand Ole Opry, the 59th Annual Grammy Awards with Lukas Graham and CMT Crossroads with Halsey.\n\"Peter Pan\" is a country pop song about a lost love, who is compared to the song's namesake as a metaphor for his immaturity and tendency to run away. The ballad has been noted by critics for showcasing a greater emotional depth than Ballerini's previous releases in terms of both lyrical complexity and performance.\n\nThe staff of country music blog Taste of Country praised Ballerini's emotive performance of the song, writing that \"the singer either performs the ballad with someone in mind, or she's country music's best actress,\" and also noted that the song confirms Ballerini's talent as a songwriter. In 2017, Billboard contributor Chuck Dauphin put \"Peter Pan\" at number two on his top 10 list of Ballerini's best songs.\n\"Peter Pan\" ranked as the most-added song on country radio for the week of March 26, 2016 with 50 Mediabase-monitored stations picking up the song. It resultantly debuted at number 54 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of April 2 and peaked at number one the week of September 23, making it her third consecutive number one on that chart. A week later, it debuted at number 47 on the Hot Country Songs chart and peaked at number one the week of September 23, making it her first number one on that chart. The achievement made Ballerini the first solo female artist to top both country music charts and also send their first three singles to number one since Wynonna Judd in 1992 with \"She Is His Only Need\", \"I Saw the Light\" and \"No One Else on Earth\". On the Billboard Hot 100, the single debuted at number 92 the week of June 16. Fourteen weeks later, it peaked at number 35 the same week it topped both Country charts, and stayed on the chart for twenty weeks. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 21, 2016. The song has sold 672,000 copies in the US as of March 2017.\nIn Canada, the song debuted at number 46 on the Canada Country chart for the week of June 11, 2016 and peaked at number four the week of September 23, remaining on the chart for twenty weeks. It also debuted at number 92 on the Canadian Hot 100 the week of August 20 and reached number 75 the week of September 23, staying on the chart for ten weeks.

Ballerini co-wrote the song with Josh Kerr, Forest Glen Whitehead and Lance Carpenter. It was released on July 8, 2014 as Ballerini's debut single and the lead single from her debut studio album, The First Time, released on May 19, 2015, by Black River Entertainment. The song is about a young woman showing interest in a man.\n\"Love Me Like You Mean It\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, making Ballerini the first solo female to top that chart with her debut single since Carrie Underwood's \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\" in 2006 and the first female country music artist to accomplish that on an independent label. It also charted at number five on the Hot Country Songs chart and number 45 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 596,000 units in the US as of May 2016. It achieved similar chart success in Canada, peaking at number three on the Canada Country chart and number 61 on the Canadian Hot 100. It garnered a Gold certification from Music Canada, denoting sales of 40,000 units in that country.\nThe accompanying music video for the song, directed by Kristin Barlowe, was shot in Nashville and features Ballerini playing party games outside with her friends and performing throughout various locations.\nThe song is a mid-tempo country pop song that, according to the digital sheet music published by Hal Leonard Music Publishing, is composed in the key of E major, in cut time with a primary chord pattern of E\u2013B\u2013F\u266fm7add4\u2013A\u209b\u1d64\u209b2. Ballerini's vocal ranges one octave, from B\u2083 to B\u2084. Natalie Wiener of Billboard called \"Love Me Like You Mean It\" a song \"about being a young woman who's openly expressing interest in a man,\" making the song a subtle message of feminism. She compared the song's opening line, \"Oh hey, boy with your hat back/Mmm I kind of like that/if you wanna walk my way,\" to Carly Rae Jepsen's 2012 hit, \"Call Me Maybe\".\n\nTaste of Country reviewed the single favorably, saying that \"Ballerini mixes modern production techniques with a straight-up country message to create an identifiable country-pop blend.\" In 2017, Billboard contributor Chuck Dauphin placed \"Love Me Like You Mean It\" at number one on his top 10 list of Ballerini's best songs.\n\"Love Me Like You Mean It\" debuted at number 60 on the US Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of October 18, 2014, and debuted at number 48 on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of December 13, 2014. It reached number one on the Country Airplay chart for the week of July 4, 2015, making Ballerini the first solo female to send her debut single to the top of that chart since Carrie Underwood did with \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\" in 2006; it also made her the first female country music artist to do so on an independent label. The song was certified Gold by the RIAA on July 14, 2015 and certified Platinum on August 4, 2016. The song has sold 596,000 copies in the US as of May 2016. In Canada, the song reached the top three of the Canada Country chart and peaked at number 61 on the Canadian Hot 100. It was certified Gold by Music Canada on September 12, 2016.\nAn acoustic music video was directed by Robert Chavers and premiered in November 2014. The official music video, directed by Kristin Barlowe, was filmed in Nashville and premiered in March 2015. In it, Ballerini is seen playing games like musical chairs and Twister with her friends outside, while performing the song from various locations inside a trailer and in the doorway of a house.\nThe video was nominated at the 2015 CMT Music Awards in the category of Breakthrough Video of the Year, but lost to Sam Hunt's \"Leave the Night On\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWard, Jaimie (July 13, 2014). \"\"Love Me Like You Mean It\" The Debut Single By Kelsea Ballerini Is Digitally Available Now\".

It was written and produced by Dane Deviller, Sean Hosein and Steve Kipner for Rowland's debut solo album Simply Deep (2002). A rock-tinged mid-tempo pop song, \"Stole\" discusses three different scenarios with teenagers whose lives have been ruined because they have made bad decisions as a result of being misunderstood, involving topics such as gun violence, bullying, suicide, adolescent pregnancy, and depression. Following \"Dilemma\" (2002), Rowland's worldwide number-one hit with rapper Nelly, \"Stole\" was released as the album's lead single on September 9, 2002.\nThe song initially divided critics; some complimented the song's social commentary, Rowland's vocal performance as well as her willingness to break away from the R&B sounds of Destiny's Child, while others criticized the musical direction and considered it an unusual single choice. A commercial success, \"Stole\" entered the top twenty on the majority of the charts it appeared on, reaching the top five in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where it remains one of her highest-charting solo singles to date. In the United States, it peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nInspired by its lyrics, a music video for \"Stole\" was directed by Sanaa Hamri. In it, Rowland is portrayed as a narrator who comments on the deaths of two male teenagers and their impact on their schoolmates, particularly a female student who discovers that she is pregnant. In further promotion of the song, Rowland performed \"Stole\" on television shows such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, CD:UK, and Top of the Pops and the TMF Awards. She also made it part of the setlist of her Simply Deeper Tour (2003) and further concert tours.\nDuring recording their third album, Survivor (2001), Destiny's Child announced that members of the group would disband for a short period to produce solo albums in the coming years, which they hoped would boost interest to Destiny's Child. With different types of music for each member to produce, Rowland and her bandmates Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Michelle Williams were not intended to compete on the charts, and thus, Destiny's Child's management strategically planned to stagger every year each member's album. Whilst Williams was the first to release a debut solo album, Heart to Yours (released in April 2002), the unexpected success of Rowland's collaboration with American rapper Nelly on the song \"Dilemma\" caused the label to advance the release date of her debut solo album, Simply Deep, to late 2002, replacing it with Knowles' solo debut Dangerously in Love (2003). As a result, Rowland was requested to rush the recording of the album within three weeks to get done, and as no time was left to produce any new material, \"Stole\"\u2014as with many songs on the album\u2014was selected out of Sony Music's song pool of demo tapes.\n\"Stole\", written and produced by Dane Deviller, Sean Hosein and Steve Kipner, is a midtempo pop rock ballad, which incorporates elements of R&B music. It is composed in the key of C major, and is in common time at ninety-six beats per minute. It is written in the common verse-chorus form and features four instruments: electric guitar, drums, guitar, and keyboards. Rowland's vocal range covers close to two octaves; she performs her highest pitch (D5) during the chorus, and her lowest pitch (E3) at the beginning of the verses. \"Stole\" is thematically a social commentary as well as a lament for unfulfilled potential.\n\"It tells a story about each of their lives and what they go through and how their lives were taken away from them,\" Rowland remarked in an interview with CNN's The Music Room, \"I loved the song when I heard the lyrics and I hoped it would hopefully touch young people and inspire. I don't mean to sound preachy 'cos it's still got a great melody and a great musical feel behind it but it was just such a great song [...].\"\n\"Stole\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Jon O'Brien named the song one of the album's highlights along with \"Can't Nobody\", \"Dilemma\" and \"Everytime You Walk Out That Door\" and called it a \"rock-tinged [...] emotive tale of school shootings and suicides.\" Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian found that the \"silky\" song emphasized that Rowland's \"speciality is the slightly funky party number with a moralising overtone.\" Chuck Taylor from Billboard found that it was proving \"that Rowling is willing to take a risk to prove a point"

The song was written by Kara DioGuardi, John Shanks and Lohan, and produced by the former two. \"Over\" was released as the second single from Speak on December 13, 2004, in the United States, by Casablanca Records. Lyrically, \"Over\" is about how her boyfriend will not commit and that their relationship feels \"on again, off again\".\nCritically, \"Over\" received positive reviews from music critics, who called the song \"catchy\" and praised Lohan's vocal performance. Commercially, \"Over\" achieved moderate success, reaching top 30 positions in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the single peaked at number one on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart for three weeks.\nJake Nava directed the accompanying music video for \"Over\", which depicts Lohan and her love interest, played by Drew Fuller, being distanced by his parents. Lohan performed \"Over\" in TV programs such as Good Morning America and The Ellen DeGeneres Show, in addition to online performances.\n\"Over\" was written by Kara DioGuardi, John Shanks and Lohan, and produced by DioGuardi and Shanks, with Shanks playing the bass, guitar, keyboards and doing the mixing, while DioGuardi provided backing vocals. Jeff Rothschild was responsible for Lohan's vocal recording, which occurred at the Henson Recording Studios in Hollywood. He also handled the song's mixing, programming and engineering. Other engineers involved were Dave Aud\u00e9 and Mark Valentine. \"Over\" is written in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C minor with Lohan's voice spanning from C\u2074 to C\u2075. According to Spence D. of IGN, \"Over\" begins like a song by the Cure, complete with a \"mournful acoustic guitar\" and a \"haunting piano-tuned synth\". He wrote that since the song was not penned by Robert Smith, \"it quickly turns into a slow rocker in which Lohan returns to her 'can't live without you' love torn subject matter\". In an 2014 interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Lohan told DeGeneres the song was about her break-up with Wilmer Valderrama.\n\"Over\" received positive reviews from critics. While responding negatively to a majority of Speak, John Murphy of MusicOMH cited \"Over\" as being \"actually rather good\" and noted similarities between the song and the works of Michelle Branch. Nicholas Fonseca from Entertainment Weekly considered the track a \"tween-slumber-party-friendly\" which \"is perfect for singing into your curling iron in front of the mirror\".\n\"Over\" achieved moderate chart success around the globe. In the United States, the single reached number one on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart for three weeks and reached number 39 on the Mainstream Top 40 component chart. In the United Kingdom, the single reached a peak of number 27 on the UK Singles Chart. In Australia, \"Over\" debuted at its peak of number 27 on the ARIA Charts, falling out of the chart seven weeks later. \"Over\" also attained the top 30 in Ireland, peaking at number 19. On the European Hot 100 Singles, \"Over\" managed to reach number 79.\nThe accompanying music video for \"Over\" was directed by Jake Nava in Los Angeles, who also directed the music video for Lohan's previous single \"Rumors\". The music video was inspired by the 1999 film American Beauty.\nIn the music video, Lohan is walking home when she sees her love interest, played by Drew Fuller, looking out of a window in his house as his mother sets the table behind him. Then his father comes up to him and they begin to argue. The curtains close and Lohan continues on to her house, next door to her boyfriend's, and runs up to her bedroom. Looking out her window, she sees that he is looking back at her. As noted inside Lohan's bedroom, she is starting to experiment with rebellious adolescence. There are Teletubbies and stuffed pandas, but also posters of bands such as L7, the Dead Kennedys and CBGB. These imagery are intercut with shots of Lohan and her band playing in a garage, a pool party and also her love interest destroying his father's car in the family garage.\nThe music video received positive reviews from critics. IGN's Spence D. commented that \"you've got a somewhat clich\u00e9d, but nonetheless hit-worthy video montage\". Justin Moran, while ranking Lohan's best music videos in Paper magazine, stated,\n\"In the video for angry rock-pop track \"Over,\" Lindsay stares at a neighbor boy from her bedroom window, wears too"

The song, which was written by Babyface, was the lead single from their second album, II. It was a commercial success, spending 14 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. It was also the third best performing song in the 1990s on Billboard, as well as ranking on Billboard Greatest of All-Time chart. It won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and was nominated for Record of the Year.\n\nLarry Flick from Billboard described \"I'll Make Love to You\" as a \"sweeping pop/R&B ballad\". He added, \"Silky harmonies waft over a well-measured arrangement chock-ful of bright, glistening synths and soft-yet-punctuating percussion. Lovely sing-along chorus initially will remind many of past glories, but single ultimately will provide a refreshing cool breeze to any of numerous radio formats it graces.\" Music writer James Masterton deemed it \"another piece of immaculate close-harmony soul\", that \"is a smash before it has ever started\". Pan-European magazine Music & Media commented, \"Silkier then the First Lady's nightgown, the first single off the \"mommy\" Boyz's upcoming album II further secures their position as the masters of the close harmony ballad.\" Alan Jones from Music Week rated it four out of five. He wrote, \"Returning after more than a year, Boyz II Men get back into the End Of The Road groove with a silky, powerful ballad penned by BabyFace. Its sweeping majesty is likely to push it high into the chart.\" Gerald Martinez from New Sunday Times noted that the song, with \"On Bended Knee\", \"tries to recapture the magic of End Of The Road, and they come close. Big production numbers with solid hooks, they should be flooding our airwaves for the next few months.\" Mark Sutherland from Smash Hits gave it three out of five, saying, \"Weeell, in their favour are the facts that they are still the meanest warblers in pop and that soul doesn't come much more silky or supersmooth than this. Against them is the fact that this is basically just End Of The Road with new lyrics \u2013 and blimmin' presumptuous lyrics at that.\"\nThe single was a massive commercial success. It held the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks, from August 27 to November 26, 1994. At the time, the song tied a record for the most weeks at number one that had been set by Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" in late 1992 and early 1993. Boyz II Men would later break their own record in 1996 with \"One Sweet Day\", a collaboration with Mariah Carey, which remained at number one on the Hot 100 for 16 weeks beginning in December 1995. \"I'll Make Love to You\" also topped the U.S. R&B and adult contemporary charts for nine and three weeks, respectively, in 1994. It sold 1,627,000 copies domestically, earning a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of over one million copies. In Canada, the song reached number one on September 26, retaining the position for two weeks. \"All I Wanna Do\" by Sheryl Crow then held the top position for four weeks, but on November 2, \"I'll Make Love to You\" returned to number one for an additional week before beginning its final descent from the chart.\nOutside North America, \"I'll Make Love to You\" also experienced major chart success. It reached number one in New Zealand on September 11, keeping that position for four weeks before \"Endless Love\" by Luther Vandross and Mariah Carey moved to number one. In Australia, the song reached the top on October 16 and stayed there for two weeks, losing its spot at number one to Silverchair's \"Tomorrow\". On both charts, the song stayed in the top 50 for 22 weeks. Across Europe, the song reached the top 10 in most countries, but fell outside this range in Germany and Finland, where it peaked at 20 and 12, respectively. In the UK, the song debuted at number 6 on the Official Singles Chart on August 28 before moving up to number 5 the next week, its peak position. It stayed in the top 40 for a further eight weeks. In Ireland, the song was slightly less successful, reaching number 7 and spending 10 weeks on the chart.\n\"I'll Make Love to You\" won the 1995 Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and two American Music Awards for Favorite Pop/Rock Single and Favorite Soul/R&B Single. It ranks at number 19 on Billboard's All-Time Top 100 Songs.\nThe accompanying music video for \"I'll Make Love to You\" was directed by American music video director, film director and VJ"

Its lyrics criticize history's oppressive treatment of women and minority groups, and Marina states that she no longer wishes to live in a world exclusively led by men.\nThe song received positive reviews from music critics, and Marina's fulfillment of her promise to work with all-females on the track was commonly discussed. Commercially, \"Man's World\" entered New Zealand's Hot 40 Singles chart and reached the lower positions of the United Kingdom's downloads and sales component charts, compiled by the Official Charts Company. The accompanying music video for the song was released the same day as the song and directed by Alexandra Gavillet. Filmed in Simi Valley, California, it features the singer performing evocative choreography with a troupe of similarly dressed dancers and was inspired by the works of the neoclassicism movement.\nIn 2019, Marina released Love + Fear, her fourth studio album and first without the \"and the Diamonds\" part of her former stage name. To promote the project, she embarked on the accompanying Love + Fear Tour later in the year and released her sixth extended play Love + Fear (Acoustic) in September 2019. Following the tour's completion, she began songwriting for a new album; in January 2020, Marina posted to her Instagram account, confirming that she was working on songs, with a photograph that used the caption \"Album 5\". Another post revealed that she had also been writing lyrics while on holiday in Paris. Later into the year, she released the standalone single \"About Love\" in February, which was featured on the soundtrack to the American romantic comedy film To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You (2020).\nThroughout the summer months, Marina teased that she was close to finishing the album and had plans to release new material soon. Former interviews claimed that her next studio album would feature a team of female musicians, in contrast to her experience with Love + Fear in 2019. Behind her intentions, she stated that she was startled to learn \"that only two per cent of producers and three per cent of engineers across popular music are women\". In September 2020, Marina shared a snippet of a previously unreleased song called \"Happy Loner\", leaving critics to assume that new music from the singer would arrive shortly. On 13 November 2020, she officially confirmed the release of a new song, titled \"Man's World\", when she posted the single's cover artwork to her social media accounts. She also posted a photograph of herself containing the lyric \"I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore\". Mike Wass, a contributor to Idolator, remarked that \"Marina has traditionally spent several years on projects\" so the announcement of \"Man's World\" was unexpected.\n\"Man's World\" was produced by American musician Jennifer Decilveo, and written and co-produced by Marina. Marina revealed in an interview with Vogue that the song was intended to be released in April 2020 to coincide with her performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, but the cancellation of the festival due to the COVID-19 pandemic prevented it. Ultimately, it was released for digital download and streaming in various countries on 18 November 2020, through Atlantic Records. That same day, Marina created a pre-order link for a limited edition 7\" single on her official merchandise website, limited to 3,000 copies, pressed on pink-coloured vinyl, and containing a previously unreleased B-side.

The song was produced by Benny and Alle Benassi, Free School, Orbit and Kennedy, and was released digitally on May 18, 2012, as the fourth single from the album. \"Don't Wake Me Up\" is an EDM song that features heavy bass and a repetitive chorus.

The accompanying music video was directed by Colin Tilley and depicts Brown in three different dreams, all of which involve a mysterious woman, played by model Araya Nicks. Brown promoted the song with live performances on televised shows, including Today and the 2012 BET Awards.\n\"Don't Wake Me Up\" was written by Alain Whyte, Alessandro Benassi, Brian Kennedy, Chris Brown, Jean-Baptiste, Marco Benassi, Michael McHenry, Nick Marsh, Priscilla Hamilton, Ryan Buendia and William Orbit. It was produced by Benny and Alle Benassi, Free School, Orbit and Kennedy. \"Don't Wake Me Up\" was originally intended for American pop singer Madonna's twelfth studio album MDNA (2012); however, she could not record the song because of her tight schedule, and Orbit gave the song to Brown. After an unofficial version of \"Don't Wake Me Up\" was leaked online in January 2012, websites reported that the song was produced by David Guetta. However, Guetta said on his Facebook and Twitter accounts, \"I'm credited for 'Don't Wake Me Up' ... but I did not produce this record. Best to CB!\".\nOn May 12, 2012, Brown announced on his Twitter account that he would release \"Don't Wake Me Up\" as the next single from his fifth studio album Fortune. It was made available for download via iTunes Stores worldwide on May 18, 2012. The Free School/William Orbit remix of the song was released in some European countries on May 22, 2012. In the United States, \"Don't Wake Me Up\" was sent to contemporary hit radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on June 12, 2012. On June 22, 2012, it was released as a CD single in Germany and as a Digital EP in the United Kingdom. The EP contains the album version, remix and Brown's previous singles \"Till I Die\" and \"Sweet Love\". It is the 10th track on Now That's What I Call Music! 44.\n\"Don't Wake Me Up\" is an EDM song that features heavy bass; it lasts for 3 minutes and 42 seconds. The instrumentation is provided by an acoustic guitar and synthesizers. Brown uses auto-tune on the hook and breakdown. \"Don't Wake Me Up\" is written in the key of B\u266d major and is set in common time with a tempo of 128 beats per minute. Brown's vocal range spans from the note of G\u2084 to the note of C\u2086. The song contains lyrics about a lost loved one who exists only in a dream, as stated by Brittany R. Villalva of The Christian Post. \"Don't Wake Me Up\" begins with a spoken introduction by an unidentified woman saying, \"Dearly Beloved, if this love only exists in my dreams, don't wake me up\". Robbie Daw of Idolator compared her voice to that of Rihanna. The song's chorus consists of the hook \"Don't wake me up\". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote that the chorus \"flourishes into a pulse-racing mix of thundering beats and squiggly electronic swizzles\". HitFix's Melinda Newman noted that the song \"resembles the sweet bounciness of 'Forever'\".\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Don't Wake Me Up\" was directed by Colin Tilley and filmed in a desert on May 14, 2012.

It was released as the fourth song on the track-listing of his third studio album Graduation (2007). The track was produced by West and retains influences from stadium rock, alternative music, and a variety of electronic-music subgenres. It contains a sample from \"My Song\" by British singer-songwriter, musician, and poet Labi Siffre. A key development in the song's creation was West touring the world the year prior with Irish rock band U2 on their Vertigo Tour. Afterwards, he sought out to compose a hip hop-oriented variation of \"City of Blinding Lights,\" the band's 2005 single. The layered arrangement expresses ambitious orchestrations, with distorted electronic synthesizer that act as the driving melodic instrument. The maximalist synths are further supplemented with a sweeping string section as well as winding keyboards. Its experimental musical composition is also notable for West's rapping technique. His lyrical delivery features a fragmented, forceful flow where he raps minimalist verses in an intense staccato vocal style. Lyrically, \"I Wonder\" is an introspective number, containing a blend of melancholic yet inspirational lines that discuss finding one's dreams.\nThe song received general acclaim from contemporary music critics, who hailed it as an album highlight. Even though it did not enter charts, the album track has become a cult classic amongst fans and listeners. West himself actually cited \"I Wonder\" as one of his top three favorite songs from Graduation. At one point, he even contemplated releasing \"I Wonder\" as the albums' fourth single, but subsequently chose \"Flashing Lights\" in its place. Nevertheless, \"I Wonder\" has since been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Although an accompanying music video was never produced for \"I Wonder,\" a special video clip was made for the track. The video clip premiered during an album listening session West held for Graduation at the New World Stages in New York City. It was one of seven clips that were designed by West and edited by film editor Derrick Lee exclusively for the event. The video clip for \"I Wonder\" features a montage of scenes that are taken from the 1982 science fiction film Tron. West performed the song on the set-list on his worldwide Glow in the Dark Tour (2008).\n\"I Wonder\" was written and produced by American hip-hop recording artist and record producer Kanye West. It was included as the fourth song on the track-listing of his third studio album, Graduation (2007). Although the composition was originally intended to be the album's opening number. The experimental hip-hop production of \"I Wonder\" represents a musical progression from the sound of West's past work. Its musical style demonstrates a distinctly European aesthetic, introducing diverse elements and influences from stadium rock, alternative music and various forms of electronic-music, all while maintaining its hip-hop essence. Kanye West claimed that more than any other song from his third album, \"I Wonder\" was the most directly influenced by the Irish rock band U2. After spending the previous year touring the world with the band on their Vertigo Tour, he became inspired by witnessing lead singer Bono open stadium concerts each night to incredible ovations. West then sought out to compose rap songs which could operate just as afficiently in similar live venues. During the recording and production of Graduation, West designed tracks in such a way that they would function well when performed in large stadiums and arenas. With \"I Wonder\" in particular, West intended to create a hip-hop-oriented variation of the rock band's 2005 single \"City of Blinding Lights.\" The song made its live debut on the Vertigo Tour and was used as the opener of the concert set-list.\nPrior to the release of his third studio album, West frequently spoke of the desire to write anthemic lyrics that listeners could connect to and personalize with, and \"I Wonder\" epitomises this ethos. The song's lyrical content is introspective in nature, as West paints a portrait of his reflective thoughts. His philosophical lyrics talk about chasing after dreams and address his rise to fame. In regards to songwriting, West disclosed that he simplifies some of his lyricism on \"I Wonder.\" On Graduation, he reconditioned his lines to be simpler, more direct, and more autobiographical in order to make them more accessible to listeners and appeal to the broadest audience possible.\nFor the track, West adopted a slower, fragmented flow to deliver his emotional lyrics.

It was released on 3 September 2013 by Columbia Records as the first single from her eleventh English-language studio album of the same name (2013). The song was co-written by Sia, Hasham \"Sham\" Hussain and Denarius \"Motesart\" Motes, and produced by Sham and Motesart. The official live music video was uploaded on Vevo on 18 September 2013. \"Loved Me Back to Life\" received critical acclaim and became a top forty hit in various countries, including number fourteen in the United Kingdom, number seventeen in South Korea, number twenty-five in Switzerland and Belgium, number twenty-six in Canada, number twenty-nine in Ireland, number thirty-two in France and number thirty-eight in Germany and Austria.\n\"Loved Me Back to Life\" is a power ballad sung in a minor key, backed by a chorus that features a dubstep beat drop. It was co-written by Sia Furler who, among many achievements, provided vocals for David Guetta's \"Titanium\" and wrote the lyrics and melody for Rihanna's \"Diamonds\". The production duties were handled by  Hasham \"Sham\" Hussain and Denarius \"Motesart\" Motes, who are also responsible for \"Is Anybody Out There?\" by K'naan and Nelly Furtado. \"Loved Me Back to Life\" premiered on the radio on 3 September 2013 and was released as a digital download on the same day. The official audio for the single was then released onto Dion's Vevo channel. The song was sent to adult contemporary radio stations in the United States on 9 September 2013 and \"Loved Me Back to Life\" (BBC Radio 2 Mix) premiered on BBC Radio 2 in the United Kingdom on 28 September 2013. The making of \"Loved Me Back to Life\" was released on Vevo on 24 September 2013. The dance remixes were done by David Morales, Dave Aud\u00e9 and Jump Smokers, and were officially released in October 2013.\n\"Loved Me Back to Life\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Gary Graff of Billboard write that Dion has acknowledged modern pop trends with the lead single and title track from her first English-language album in six years. The \"stuttering\" vocal hook and dubstep beats are certainly of the moment, keeping pace with the Rihannas of the world, while Dion's own performance\u2014full and soaring, if a bit darker in tone than usual\u2014is characteristically \"\u00c2commanding\". Popjournalism praised the song and concluded: \"'Life' nicely sets up Dion's 5 Nov album release as a unit-selling single that hits the perfect mainstream sweet spot without alienating even her most milquetoast fan\". MTV's Brad Stern also praised and named it as one of five must-hear pop songs of the week: \"For her first English studio album in six years, Celine's leading with \"Loved Me Back to Life,\" a major power ballad penned by pop's most in-demand songwriter, Sia. It's a serious chills-inducing belter, packed full of emotion and crisp production. Welcome back, Celine, we missed you!\"  The Huffington Post was also positive, but little less by: \"a supremely modern track which sees the 45-year-old legend dipping into dubstep and even employing a bit of a hip-hop style beat. The song is nice, but it almost sounds like her soaring chorus is going to be followed up by some fiery Eminem verses over the skittering bass and drums\". Idolator editor Sam Lansky wrote a rave review: \"That stuttering vocal loop! The bombastic production! The funky instrumentation! The huge, surging chorus! The dubby beat drop on the refrain! The fact that it was written by Sia! The fact that it's new Celine Dion in the first place! It's all just marvellous. Unsurprisingly, the song has shades of Rihanna's \"Diamonds,\" but it feels markedly fresh and modern in its own right; as many divas have shown, staying relevant gets thornier when you\u2019re entering, y\u2019know, your fourth decade as an international superstar, but this is a solid effort from the Canadian chanteuse that should introduce her to some new fans as well as satisfying longtime supporters\".\nOK! compared: \"Her new song, in my opinion, is like Cher meets J.Lo and is a departure from \"My Heart Will Go On\" but I'm into it. You?\". Feedback Musiq praised a song: \"The studio cut sounds as powerful as she did live and is easily one of the best lyrical efforts by Sia. If six years has been too long for you, you\u2019re about to fall in love with Celine all over again as she gives you life with this new one\". DaysTune was surprised: \"I'm not sure"

It was released as the album's second single on 9 August 2002 and was also featured in the film Stuart Little 2. The song was written and produced by Kristian Lundin and Andreas Carlsson, who already worked with Dion in 1999 on \"That's the Way It Is\".\n\"I'm Alive\" is an uplifting midtempo song, where Celine declares she is alive, fulfilled as a mother, and \"in love.\" The music video was directed by Dave Meyers between 24\u201325 May 2002 and premiered in June 2002. There were two versions made: with or without the Stuart Little 2 movie scenes. \"I'm Alive\" became a worldwide hit, reaching the top ten in many countries. It was certified platinum in Belgium (50,000) and gold in France (250,000).\nWhile working on the album, Celine commented, \"I couldn't wait to go back into the recording studio. And, I loved the songs that people wrote for me on this album. Those songs became even closer to me because, the fact that I took two years off, they wrote songs for me that were even closer to my emotions. I had things to talk about. I had things to sing about. It was a fun adventure, no pressure, relaxed, smooth, powerful but controlled. I really had a wonderful time. And to see my friends again, it was great.\"\n\"I'm Alive\" was released as the album's second single on 12 August 2002. For radio release, the song was re-worked by Humberto Gatica. Epic Records moved forward with the \"Humberto Gatica\" version as the main version. His version was released on the Stuart Little 2 soundtrack as well as promotional and commercial CD singles.\nAlthough in October 2008 the album version of \"I'm Alive\" was included on My Love: Essential Collection, the new remix by Laurent Wolf was released to promote it in France. In January 2009, further promotional remixes were made by Maurice Joshua for U.S. clubs.\n\"I'm Alive\" was written by Kristian Lundin and Andreas Carlsson and produced by Lundin. They worked with Celine before writing her 1999 hit \"That's the Way It Is.\" It is an uplifting midtempo song, where Celine declares she is alive, fulfilled as a mother, and \"in love.\"\nThe song is written in the key of E\u266d major with a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute.  Dion's vocals span from A\u266d\u2083 to D\u2085 in the song.\nWhile reviewing the Stuart Little 2 soundtrack, William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that \"Celine Dion occupies the position taken by Trisha Yearwood on the soundtrack to Stuart Little in 1999, singing an upbeat rhythm number.\" Another editor, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the song uplifting and highlighted it; in his review for album he called the song a \"hitworthy uptempo gem\". ABC's RollerCoaster review was positive, commenting that \"this is the type of music you play in the background when your having a good laugh with friends or a nice tea with family. It's the kind of song you sing along to and slowly get wrapped in it.\" Chuck Taylor from Billboard said that \"I'm Alive\" demonstrates a stylistic \"left turn, with its throbbing tribal rhythms and a loose, sky-grazing vocal from Dion.\" The \"percolating\" Humberto Gatica Mix \"adds juice\" to the album version, while the uptempo Wake Up Mix, with assistance from Ric Wake and Richie Jones, is Dion's most \"inspired and festive\" remix to date, with Blondie's \"Heart of Glass\" woven into the beat to \"splendid effect\". Neal Sky of Pop Dirt named it a \"bubblegum-radio-song\".

The song was written and produced by Kristian Lundin and Andreas Carlsson, who already worked with Dion in 1999 on \"That's the Way It Is\".\n\"I'm Alive\" is an uplifting midtempo song, where Celine declares she is alive, fulfilled as a mother, and \"in love.\" The music video was directed by Dave Meyers between 24\u201325 May 2002 and premiered in June 2002.

It was certified platinum in Belgium (50,000) and gold in France (250,000).\nWhile working on the album, Celine commented, \"I couldn't wait to go back into the recording studio. And, I loved the songs that people wrote for me on this album. Those songs became even closer to me because, the fact that I took two years off, they wrote songs for me that were even closer to my emotions. I had things to talk about. I had things to sing about. It was a fun adventure, no pressure, relaxed, smooth, powerful but controlled. I really had a wonderful time. And to see my friends again, it was great.\"\n\"I'm Alive\" was released as the album's second single on 12 August 2002. For radio release, the song was re-worked by Humberto Gatica. Epic Records moved forward with the \"Humberto Gatica\" version as the main version. His version was released on the Stuart Little 2 soundtrack as well as promotional and commercial CD singles.\nAlthough in October 2008 the album version of \"I'm Alive\" was included on My Love: Essential Collection, the new remix by Laurent Wolf was released to promote it in France.

The song was written and produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, while Lange and his then-wife, country singer Shania Twain did the backing vocals. Lyrically, the song speaks about motherly love and fear of losing one's mother. It was released as the album's third and last commercial single on 18 November 2002 by Columbia Records and Epic Records.\nThe song received favorable reviews from music critics, who called it a \"heartfelt and emotional song\", while praising Dion's performance. The \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\" music video was directed by Chris Applebaum between 12\u201313 October 2002 in Paris, France, and premiered in November 2002. The song performed moderately on the charts, peaking inside the top fifty in the countries that it charted, but it did not match the success of previous singles.\n\"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\" was written and produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, who already worked with Dion in 1999 on \"If Walls Could Talk.\" Lange and his then-wife, country singer Shania Twain did the backing vocals. The song runs to 5 minutes 19 seconds with a radio edit of 4 minutes 23 seconds. It was recorded at Studio Piccolo and released 18 November 2002.\nLyrically, the devastatingly emotional ballad speaks about the absolute love between a child and her mother. \"There is no other love like a mother's love for her child,\" she sings. C\u00e9line first heard the Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange song three years ago [1999] and turn it down. \"Now, being a mother, I found the strength to sing it, but it was hard,\" she said. Its lesson? \"Never wait too long to tell someone how you feel,\" she answered.\nIn October 2008, \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\" was included on the European version of My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection greatest hits.\nBarnes & Noble's editorial review called it \"a heartfelt, country-tinged song.\" Chuck Taylor from Billboard criticized the choice of the third single, \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word),\" a ballad relegated solely to adult contemporary radio stations. He noticed that the song is \"devastatingly beautiful,\" offering a loving tribute to one's mother at death's door and that Dion \"delivers it with a heaving helping of passion, emotionally drawing one's attention to the devotional message.\" Although he felt that many will connect to the loss of a parent, on a commercial level, this was a disappointing decision. Mike Ross of Jam! Canoe wrote, \"Celine is at her lovey-doveyest in Mutt Lange's Goodbye's (The Saddest Word), helped by not one, but two soaring key changes in the same song, which is then launched into a high Earth orbit of melodrama by an orchestra that would make John Williams blush with envy.\" Neal Sky of Pop Dirt perceived that she\u2019s singing now such sweet, sweet verses like \"I found it all in the eyes of a boy (in A New Day Has Come\" or an even sweeter combination with her subject: \"there\u2019s is no other love like a mother\u2019s for her child\" penned by Robert \"Mutt\" Lange. Commenting for Rolling Stone in May 2002, Rob Sheffield said of the Mutt Lange composition it is \"sure to inspire many hours of dull debate with Bernie Taupin.\" The reviewer also alluded to Dion's voice as \"just furniture polish\". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented, \"It is the kind of sappy mama-lovin' tune that will leave you nauseous or in tears.\" Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic described the song as a \"beautiful Country-style pop ballad.\"\nThe song performed moderately on the charts, peaking inside the top-forty in some countries. On the Belgian Flanders Singles Chart, the song debuted at number 47, on 14 December 2002. The following week, the song fell to number 49, but on 28 December 2002, the song climbed to number 46. In its fourth week, the song peaked at number 39. On the Belgian Wallonia Singles Chart, the song debuted and peaked at number 36, leaving the charts the following week. In [the Netherlands, the song debuted at number 67 on the Dutch Top 40, on 30 November 2002. The following week, the song jumped to number 51. The song  kept fluctuating on the chart for the next two weeks, until it climbed from number 67 to number 42. On 18 January 2003, the song peaked at number 38, spending 11 consecutive weeks on the chart.\nIn Austria, the song debuted at number 50 on the \u00d63 Austria Top 40. The following week, the song"

It was released as the second single from The Colour of My Love on 21 March 1994 by Columbia Records. The song was written by Peter Zizzo and Jimmy Bralower and produced by Ric Wake. \"Misled\" topped the US Dance Club Songs chart and reached number four in Canada. It also peaked at number 15 in the UK and number 23 in the United States.\nEditor Jose F. Promis of AllMusic reviewed the single and rated it 4 out 5 stars. He called the album version \"definitive and muscular\", the \"Groove Edit\" a \"soulful, more hip-hop-leaning take on the song\", the \"MK Radio Remix\" and the \"Richie Jones Club Mix\" \"two smooth and sleek house remixes\" and finally \"MK's History Mix\" \"deeper and housier\". He concluded the review calling the single a rarity and \"...she is soulful, sassy, exuberant, campy, and almost just plain nasty, and it works, resulting in a long-forgotten, and definitive highlight (and oddity) in the singer's illustrious career\". Larry Flick from Billboard stated that Dion \"vamps with her rarely displayed, assertive, white-knuckled edge.\" Cashbox noted it as \"an upbeat, aggressive power dance number\" with a \"too catchy chorus and left-of-center edginess\".\nWhile referring to Dion's \"forcefully resonant and multiflavored vocals\", Chicago Tribune editor Brad Webber wrote: \"On \"The Colour of My Love\", you've got to dig deep to find them, though, past the crooked roots of a Janet Jackson impersonation (\"Misled\" and \"Think Twice\")\". Pip Ellwood-Hughes from Entertainment Focus noted that the song \"saw Dion take a rare departure into a dance-led sound\". Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report wrote, \"Mention the name Celine Dion and a lot of people are inclined to think of her hit ballads. To be sure, this French-Canadian songstress has had some of the biggest of the decade. But she's just as comfortable picking up the tempo, which she does with ease on this bright and tight Ric Wake production\". Another editor called it \"powerful\". British newspaper Lennox Herald stated that Dion \"gives it her all and manages to inject a certain dramatic punch\". Alan Jones from Music Week deemed it \"an altogether less demanding, and less enticing song [than \"The Power of Love\"], adding that \"it chugs along cheerfully enough, and Dion lets rip once or twice, but the song's saving grace is a contagious chorus\". Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic described it as \"groovy\" and \"full-of-life\".\n\"Misled\" won the BMI Pop Award for Most Performed Song in the United States.\nIn Canada, \"Misled\" entered the RPM Top Singles chart in March 1994 and peaked at number four two months later. On the RPM Adult Contemporary, it reached number two and stayed in this position for five weeks. On The Record's charts, \"Misled\" peaked at number seven on Retail Singles and number two on Contemporary Hit Radio. In the United States, the song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1994 and reached number 23 in June 1994. It became Dion's first song to top the US Dance Club Songs, where it stayed at number one for two weeks. It also reached number 15 on the US Adult Contemporary. In the United Kingdom, \"Misled\" originally reached number 40 in April 1994. However, after the re-release, it achieved a new peak of number 15 in November 1995. \"Misled\" entered the Australian chart in May 1994 and reached number 55 the next month. In June 1994, it also debuted on the charts in New Zealand and Germany, where it peaked at numbers 31 and 83, respectively. In 2008, \"Misled\" was included on the European edition of Dion's greatest hits compilation, My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection.\nThe music video was directed by Randee St. Nicholas and released in June 1994. It alternates between scenes of Dion performing in a club, posing in front of a mirror and in a bathtub, and quarreling with a lover. The video was included on Dion's DVD video collection All the Way... A Decade of Song & Video (2001) and on the UK enhanced CD single of \"A New Day Has Come\".\n\"Misled\" was performed by Dion during her 1994-95 The Colour of My Love Tour, her 1995-96 D'eux Tour, her 1996-97 Falling Into You Around the World Tour and during the opening night of Dion's Live 2017 tour in Copenhagen. \nLive versions of \"Misled\" can be found on The Colour of My Love Concert DVD (1995), Live \u00e0 Paris DVD (1996) and Live in Memphis VHS (1998).\nAustralian cassette and CD single\n\"Misled\" \u2013 3:30\n\"Real Emotion\" \u2013 4:26\n\"Misled\" (The Serious Mix) \u2013"

The song features songwriting credits from Ryan Baharloo, Ester Dean, Lukasz Gottwald, John Charles Monds and Henry Walter, with production credits from Gottwald and Walter under their production monikers, Dr. Luke and Cirkut. The song was released on June 3, 2014, as the lead single from the EP. \"Ugly Heart\" is a guitar-driven pop song that also incorporates a ukulele.\nThe track centers on a man who initially appears beautiful on the outside, but later displays his ugly side. The group thought a lot of women would be able to relate to the song and hoped it would inspire them to find someone who would treat them well. The song was met with general acclaim from critics. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Chris Marrs Piliero. It depicts the girls being arrested by the police, after they tattoo the word \"ugly\" on a man's face. It was watched 2.5 million times in less than a week following its release.\n\"Ugly Heart\" was the last single to be released by the group before band member Simone Battle's death on September 5, 2014.\nThe song received renewed interest in October 2016 when British girl group Little Mix released their latest single \"Shout Out to My Ex,\" from their fourth studio album Glory Days. Some people said that the choruses of the two songs had similarities.\nGroup member Paula Van Oppen explained that \"Ugly Heart\" was about ending a relationship with a guy who initially appeared to be nice on the outside, but once you got to know him well, the ugly side to his personality came out. Van Oppen said the inspiration for the song \"was giving that message of strength and confidence and being a good person, inside and out. Not just having the exterior surface be all that you are.\" Natasha Slayton hoped the track would inspire people to date someone who treated them well, instead of dating someone because of their beauty. Simone Battle commented that the track felt personal to her, as it reminded her of a time when she had crush on a guy in high school, who pretended to like her back and embarrassed her. Battle also thought there would be a lot of women who could relate to the song. While Van Oppen added that the group's songs were empowering.\nThe song leaked in March 2014, before it was officially released on June 3, 2014. It was sent to mainstream radio on June 24, 2014. The single's artwork was unveiled the day before the single was released.\n\"Ugly Heart\" was written by Ryan Baharloo, Ester Dean, Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, John Charles Monds and Henry \"Cirkut\" Walter. It was produced by Dr. Luke and Cirkut, with Max Martin as executive producer. \"Ugly Heart\" is a guitar-driven pop song, with electronic influences. The song also makes use of a ukulele, which gives it a \"country vibe\". Battle described \"Ugly Heart\" as being \"really eclectic\", while Slayton branded it \"a Hawaiian hoedown\". During the bridge, Van Oppen talks over strumming guitars, followed by Battle who sings a high note, before the song goes back into the chorus. Alex Kritselis from Bustle.com said the chorus had \"a chant-like quality to it\" that made it easy sing along with.\n\"Ugly Heart\" received general acclaim from contemporary music critics. A writer from Popjustice branded it a \"really quite brilliant song about hot wankers\" and gave it a 9 out of 10 rating. The writer believed the song was better than the group's debut and improved their chances of a successful career. Jamieson Cox from Time described the song as \"moonlit, guitar-oriented pop\" and a \"sneering kiss-off\" with many \"undeniable\" features of a Dr. Luke production. He also praised the band members chemistry on the song. Mike Wass from Idolator thought the track was an \"irresistible anthem\" that left him \"hooked\" after one listen. He particularly liked the \"guitar-pop direction\" because it differed from the more dominant charting electro-pop songs. Perez Hilton described the song as infectious, great and awesome. He likened the beginning of \"Ugly Heart\" to a signature Jason Mraz track and praised the lead vocals.\nHomorazzi.com reporter Donovan Pagtakhan named it the group's best song to date and a \"catchy pop track with a folk vibe\", while Maximum Pop! said the track \"feels like a tune you'd pump in your car when riding with your girlfriends. Brad Stern from MTV labeled it a \"certifiable, Dr. Luke-produced smash\" packed with \"chant-along-friendly hooks\". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard quipped \"the group uncovers the winning pop formula that"

It was released on May 25, 2018, to radio stations through Atlantic Records as the fourth single from her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy (2018). \"I Like It\" is a Latin trap song that comprises a trap drum beat and salsa music. It was written by the three performers along with Jordan Thorpe and Klenord Raphael, while the production was handled by J. White Did It, Tainy, Craig Kallman and Invincible. The song contains a sample from \"I Like It Like That\", replayed by musicians during production, with Tony Pab\u00f3n, Manny Rodriguez, and Benny Bonnilla being credited as co-writers.\nWork on the song took from October 2017 to early April 2018. Its music video was filmed in Little Havana, Miami and has received more than 1.3 billion views. The single topped the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Cardi B's second number one\u2014the first time a female rapper achieved this in the chart's history, and the first for both Bad Bunny and J Balvin. It also reached the top 10 in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Critically acclaimed, Billboard staff, Los Angeles Times, and Apple Music's editorial selection ranked it as the best song of the year, while Rolling Stone named it \"the best summer song of all time.\"\n\"I Like It\" was nominated for Record of the Year at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. It became the first song led by a female rapper to surpass a billion streams on Spotify, also making Cardi B the first woman in hip hop with a pair of billion-streamers on the service, joining her collaboration \"Girls Like You\". \"I Like It\" is the highest-ranked song led by a female rapper on the Billboard Hot 100 decade-end chart for the 2010s. It was certified nine times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2020, becoming the second-highest-certified single by a female rapper, following the Diamond-certified \"Bodak Yellow\". As of 2021, it is the most-streamed song by a female rapper in the UK.\nDuring the recording sessions of Invasion of Privacy, Cardi and her team were listening to beats and song ideas. Craig Kallman wanted to include a track that pays homage to her Latin heritage and searched among his Latin music collection of records that he used to play when he was a DJ. Decided for Pete Rodriguez's \"I Like It Like That\" and \"Oh That's Nice\", he added J. White to the production process. The sample of the former song \"over a very rough instrumental\" and with a Cardi verse on it was sent to musician Edgar Machuca. White and Machuca worked on the production, chopping up the sample and trying to \"make the song sound better and cohesive and beef up the production.\" Cardi re-wrote the hook a number of times and cut vocals, eventually choosing the chorus she was most comfortable with. The three producers looped the \"I Like It\" part as they felt that was the catchiest part of the sample. Machuca proposed to add Bad Bunny and J Balvin to the track, with both artists contributing with their verses and ideas. Tainy and Invicible finished working on the production focusing on the instrumentals. Work on the record started in October 2017, and finished in early April 2018.\n\"I Like It\" is a Latin trap song. It is a blend of trap and salsa, and interpolates 1967 boogaloo song \"I Like It Like That\". By replaying the sample instead of using the physical sample, its owners receive compensation and credit for their composition, with production saving money and retaining publishing ownership. As noted by a Billboard editor, the song is \"heavily indebted to the world of Latin hip hop.\" Bad Bunny raps in English and Spanish, while J Balvin performs in Spanish.\n\"I Like It\" received critical acclaim. Writing for Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos deemed it \"the song of the summer\" and commented \"[it] sounds like it was chemically concocted in a mad scientist's lab to be 2018's reigning song of the summer. [...] Everything about this song is perfect for summer: the trap-meets-salsa beat, features from two of reggaeton's biggest stars, a sample of Pete Rodriguez's"

It is co-written by Clarkson and Ryan Tedder, who also produced it. The song was released as the album's third single in August 2009. Lyrically, \"Already Gone\" is about the breakup of a relationship; the music consists of an arrangement using a piano, drums, and string instruments.\nThe production and release of \"Already Gone\" have been surrounded in controversy. Clarkson claimed that Tedder re-used the musical arrangement on the 2009 Beyonc\u00e9 song \"Halo\", and stated that the public would incorrectly assume that she had stolen it; Tedder declared the accusations hurtful and false. After failing to prevent the song from being included on All I Ever Wanted because the track listing had already been finalized and the album was already being pressed, Clarkson then voiced her anger towards her record company bosses for subsequently deciding to release it as a single. The accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who complained that he was not allowed to fully realize his vision, and stated he was unhappy with the final result. It features scenes of Clarkson dressed in a gold gown and expensive jewelry while lying on a chaise longue in an apartment. Shots of floating objects intersperse a second scene in which Clarkson, wearing a black dress, sings in a rehearsal room while surrounded by the instruments of an invisible orchestra.\nDespite her dissatisfaction with the song's release as a single, Clarkson began promoting it in July 2009, performing it live on the Late Show with David Letterman and other talk shows. In the fall, she performed the song on VH1 Divas and at the American Music Awards. She included \"Already Gone\" in the encore set of her 2009 All I Ever Wanted Tour. Clarkson has also performed the song in tours after. The song has received much praise from music critics, and is regarded as one of the highlights of All I Ever Wanted. Critics have praised the song for its expressions of vulnerability, its emotional impact, and its successful use of the ballad form. It peaked at number\u00a013 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia.\n\"Already Gone\" was co-written by Clarkson and OneRepublic lead singer Ryan Tedder. Tedder describes it as \"an emotional, heartbreaking breakup song.\"  Tedder and Clarkson wrote six songs together for inclusion on Clarkson's fourth studio album All I Ever Wanted, and \"Already Gone\" is one of three of those that appear on the track list.\n\"Already Gone\" is a pop ballad. The music is described by Sarah Liss of CBC News as having \"a pounding heartbeat, twinkly piano and swooping strings\", and by James Montgomery of MTV as having \"somber piano, crashing drums and hand-claps\". Eric R. Danton from The Hartford Courant explains that the piano and string arrangements \"roll mournfully\" over the percussion. The sheet music indicates that the song is set in common time and has a moderately slow tempo with a metronome of 74 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major arranged in the chord progression of A\u2013Esus4\u2013E\u2013F\u266fm\u2013D\u2013A\u2013Esus4-E\u2013F\u266fm\u2013D\u2013Bm\u2013D in the verses, and A\u2013Esus4\u2013E\u2013F\u266fm\u2013E\u2013D\u2013E in the chorus. The vocal range spans from B\u2083 to E\u2085.\nThe song's narrative is in first person, and depicts Clarkson telling her lover that although he has done nothing wrong in their relationship, it was never meant to be and is destined for failure. She tells her partner that he \"couldn't have loved [her] better\", but to avoid hurting him in the future, he should move on, as she \"is already gone\". Clarkson sings with what Danton describes as \"layered vocals\".\nBefore teaming with Clarkson to write \"Already Gone\", Ryan Tedder had co-written Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Halo\" for her album I Am... Sasha Fierce. Clarkson later heard \"Halo\" and noticed distinct similarities between the two songs, most notably in the melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps in their backing tracks. She confronted Tedder about using the same arrangement, claiming that people would assume she had stolen it from Knowles. Clarkson tried to have the song removed from All I Ever Wanted, but it was too late to make any changes; the album was already being pressed"

It was written and produced by Furtado and Rick Nowels. The song was first released 30 July 2007 as the album's fifth and final single in the United Kingdom and was later released in various formats across Europe in the fall of 2007. Furtado recorded a new version of the song as a duet with Australian country singer Keith Urban the following year, which was released to North America in April 2008.\n\"In God's Hands\" achieved only moderate success, becoming her lowest-charting single from Loose in every European country in which it was promoted. Following the song's North American re-release in 2008, however, \"In God's Hands\" reached its peak at number 11 on the Canadian Hot 100, earning Furtado her second highest-charting single to date since the chart's inception in 2007, and also peaked at a career-high position of 15 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.\nA country/pop song, \"In God's Hands\" is inspired by Furtado's 2005 breakup with DJ Jasper Gahunia, the father of her daughter. According to Furtado, the song was, at the time of its recording, \"as far as [she] was willing to go in terms of pop right now\".\nLyrically, the song is about moving on and starting anew, with Furtado declaring in the chorus, \"Our love's floating up in the sky in heaven/ Where it began, back in God's hands.\" Her vocal style on the song has been described as \"pretty.\"\nFurtado also recorded a Spanish version, titled \"En las manos de Dios\", which appears in a Spanish limited edition of Loose.\nIn early 2008, Furtado re-recorded \"In God's Hands\" as a duet featuring New Zealand country music singer Keith Urban, who was reportedly Furtado's \"first choice.\" On her rationale behind the selection, Furtado said, \"I love country music. Keith Urban's voice is plaintive and sweet; he's a pure songsmith, with an extremely humble tone to his voice... He's right on the border of country, roots and pop. He really defies description, and those are my favorite kinds of artists.\"\nSean Fennessey of Pitchfork criticized the songwriting on the chorus and wrote that, \"If \"Promiscuous\" is one of the fiercest songs of lust in recent memory, \"In God's Hands\" is one of the limpest.\" Jonathan Keefe of Slant was more ambivalent, praising Furtado's vocals but maligning the song's inclusion on Loose. \"While \"In God's Hands\" is one of the first times in her career that Furtado's voice could... be described as pretty,\" writes Keefe, \"the song itself... simply doesn't fit with the first two-thirds of the album.\"\n\"In God's Hands\" debuted and peaked at number 116 on the UK Singles Chart dated 11 August 2007. It was the first single of Furtado's career (that was promoted to the United Kingdom) to miss the top 100. Elsewhere in Europe, the song performed moderately well. It reached a peak position at number 53 in Austria, number 33 in Germany, number 20 in Italy, number 33 in the Netherlands, and number 58 in Sweden. \"In God's Hands\" also reached number 9 and number 22, respectively, on the Flanders and Wallonian Ultratip Bubbling Under charts.\nThe 2008 duet version of the song debuted at number 11 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart dated 3 May 2008 and was the week's highest debut. This tied it with \"Say It Right\" as Furtado's second highest-charting single to date in her native country since the creation of the Canadian Hot 100 chart in 2007. \"In God's Hands\" also reached number seven on the Digital Songs component chart dated 3 May 2008. The song spent a total of 16 weeks on the Canadian Hot 100. In the United States, \"In God's Hands\" entered the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart dated 26 April 2008 at number 25 and was the week's highest debut. On the chart dated 21 June 2008, the song rose to number 18, breaking out of a tie with \"Say It Right\" for Furtado's highest-charting adult contemporary single to date. It reached its peak at number 15 on the chart dated 26 July 2008.\nA music video for the song was shot on 9 May 2007 between 5 and 7 a.m. in Los Angeles, California and directed by Jesse Dylan. It features Furtado on a beach during both daytime and nighttime, singing the song while sitting on a tree stump, lying on the sand and holding a white sheet, which she lies under. Furtado is also shown walking on the shore, weeping and looking onto the ocean. The video is shot entirely in black and white. It was made available on Furtado's Vevo channel 12"

It is co-written by Clarkson and Ryan Tedder, who also produced it. The song was released as the album's third single in August 2009. Lyrically, \"Already Gone\" is about the breakup of a relationship; the music consists of an arrangement using a piano, drums, and string instruments.\nThe production and release of \"Already Gone\" have been surrounded in controversy. Clarkson claimed that Tedder re-used the musical arrangement on the 2009 Beyonc\u00e9 song \"Halo\", and stated that the public would incorrectly assume that she had stolen it; Tedder declared the accusations hurtful and false. After failing to prevent the song from being included on All I Ever Wanted because the track listing had already been finalized and the album was already being pressed, Clarkson then voiced her anger towards her record company bosses for subsequently deciding to release it as a single. The accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who complained that he was not allowed to fully realize his vision, and stated he was unhappy with the final result. It features scenes of Clarkson dressed in a gold gown and expensive jewelry while lying on a chaise longue in an apartment. Shots of floating objects intersperse a second scene in which Clarkson, wearing a black dress, sings in a rehearsal room while surrounded by the instruments of an invisible orchestra.\nDespite her dissatisfaction with the song's release as a single, Clarkson began promoting it in July 2009, performing it live on the Late Show with David Letterman and other talk shows. In the fall, she performed the song on VH1 Divas and at the American Music Awards. She included \"Already Gone\" in the encore set of her 2009 All I Ever Wanted Tour. Clarkson has also performed the song in tours after. The song has received much praise from music critics, and is regarded as one of the highlights of All I Ever Wanted. Critics have praised the song for its expressions of vulnerability, its emotional impact, and its successful use of the ballad form. It peaked at number\u00a013 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia.\n\"Already Gone\" was co-written by Clarkson and OneRepublic lead singer Ryan Tedder. Tedder describes it as \"an emotional, heartbreaking breakup song.\"  Tedder and Clarkson wrote six songs together for inclusion on Clarkson's fourth studio album All I Ever Wanted, and \"Already Gone\" is one of three of those that appear on the track list.\n\"Already Gone\" is a pop ballad. The music is described by Sarah Liss of CBC News as having \"a pounding heartbeat, twinkly piano and swooping strings\", and by James Montgomery of MTV as having \"somber piano, crashing drums and hand-claps\". Eric R. Danton from The Hartford Courant explains that the piano and string arrangements \"roll mournfully\" over the percussion. The sheet music indicates that the song is set in common time and has a moderately slow tempo with a metronome of 74 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major arranged in the chord progression of A\u2013Esus4\u2013E\u2013F\u266fm\u2013D\u2013A\u2013Esus4-E\u2013F\u266fm\u2013D\u2013Bm\u2013D in the verses, and A\u2013Esus4\u2013E\u2013F\u266fm\u2013E\u2013D\u2013E in the chorus. The vocal range spans from B\u2083 to E\u2085.\nThe song's narrative is in first person, and depicts Clarkson telling her lover that although he has done nothing wrong in their relationship, it was never meant to be and is destined for failure. She tells her partner that he \"couldn't have loved [her] better\", but to avoid hurting him in the future, he should move on, as she \"is already gone\". Clarkson sings with what Danton describes as \"layered vocals\".\nBefore teaming with Clarkson to write \"Already Gone\", Ryan Tedder had co-written Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Halo\" for her album I Am... Sasha Fierce. Clarkson later heard \"Halo\" and noticed distinct similarities between the two songs, most notably in the melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps in their backing tracks. She confronted Tedder about using the same arrangement, claiming that people would assume she had stolen it from Knowles. Clarkson tried to have the song removed from All I Ever Wanted, but it was too late to make any changes; the album was already being pressed"

The song features songwriting credits from Max Martin, Lukasz Gottwald, and Claude Kelly and production credits from Martin and Gottwald under his production moniker, Dr. Luke. Clarkson co-wrote the track but refused to include her name in the credits as she didn't want to be associated with Luke. \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" was released as the lead single from the album and premiered on January 13, 2009, in the United States on the Z100 radio station and was made available to download three days later. The song has met with positive reviews from music critics, who praised the song's pop composition, which incorporates rock and dance elements.\n\"My Life Would Suck Without You\" peaked at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 when it moved up the chart 96 places from number 97 in its second week on the chart. The song's chart climbing gave Clarkson the record for a single with the furthest jump to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 after achieving the feat with her 2002 single \"A Moment Like This\". Outside of the United States, \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" topped the charts in Canada, Hungary, and the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, where the Idols franchise that spawned American Idol originated, Clarkson became the only alumnus of an international version of Pop Idol to top the UK Singles Chart until Canadian Idol alumnus Carly Rae Jepsen achieved the feat with \"Call Me Maybe\" in April 2012.\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Wayne Isham and presents Clarkson's relationship with her fictional boyfriend as being fluctuating and tumultuous as the two are depicted arguing and throwing out each other's belongings whilst mirroring the sentiments of the song and the positive influence each has on the other. The video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the Best Female Video category in 2009.\n\"My Life Would Suck Without You\" was written by Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, Max Martin and Claude Kelly, with additional uncredited songwriting by Kelly Clarkson. Record executive Clive Davis hired Gottwald and Martin to produce a new song for Clarkson in 2008 after her 2007 album My December, for which she refused to work with them, under-performed commercially. Clarkson explained that she objected the collaboration through the entire process due to previous bad experiences working with Gottwald, who co-produced \"Since U Been Gone\" and \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" for Clarkson in 2004. Clarkson eventually gave in claiming the label wouldn't put out her record otherwise. Yet, she was unsatisfied with the original version of the song, which she says differed greatly from the final version and included lyrical references to marijuana, so the writers assisted her in making the song more personal to her and \"better than it was,\" according to Clarkson. After the song was finalized and significant changes to the lyrics had been made, Clarkson said RCA approached her about taking a proper writing credit for the track, which she refused in order to make a point to the label as they failed to meet her one request which was not to have her work with Luke again.\nClaude Kelly worked on additional vocal production for the song. Dr. Luke provided the drums, bass and programming as well as working with Martin on guitars and synthesizers. The song was engineered at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California and Dr. Luke's Studio by Emily Wright and Sam Holland. Wright also edited the vocals with Aniela Gottwald and Kool Kojak.\nOriginally scheduled to hit airwaves on January 19, the song debuted on New York City Top 40 station Z100 on January 13, and the single was then transmitted digitally to radio stations at 6:00 pm EST for immediate airplay. It went officially for adds on radio station playlists on January 20, 2009. It was given a digital release on January 16, 2009, at Amazon.com's MP3 store, with a subsequent release on the US and Canadian iTunes Stores soon after. The song was also released as a download on January 16 in Australia on iTunes. On January 23, the song was announced as the most added song to radio in Australia.\n\"My Life Would Suck Without You\""

Written by Mitch Allan, Audra Mae, Kara DioGuardi, and Jason Evigan, the song is an uptempo synth-pop track produced by Greg Kurstin. Lyrically, it sings of meeting a person who restores someone's faith in love. Inspired by 1980s synthpop music, \"Heartbeat Song\" was released by RCA Records as the album's lead single on January 12, 2015.\n\"Heartbeat Song\" was released to a positive response from music critics, who complimented the song's production and praised Clarkson's decision to return to mainstream pop music. Other critics, however, noted the strong resemblance the song's melody bore to that of Jimmy Eat World's single \"The Middle\" (2001), which later allowed the band to be credited as additional songwriters. Commercially, the single debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 37 and has peaked at number 21, marking Clarkson's sixteenth top 40 hit on the chart. It also became her fifth song to top the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart and marked as her highest debut among her twenty career entries on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart. Internationally, it became a top ten hit single in Austria, Belgium, Poland, Slovenia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom while also becoming a top 20 hit in the national charts of the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Slovakia and Sweden.\nFilmed by Marc Klasfeld, its accompanying music video features a scenes of various downtrodden people and their process of finding love again. Clarkson premiered \"Heartbeat Song\" in a live televised performance on The Graham Norton Show in February 2015 and has performed it on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and the fourteenth season of American Idol. The song was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards.\nShortly after the release of her first Christmas album, Wrapped in Red (2013), Clarkson, despite her pregnancy, began to record material for her seventh studio album, with a target release date in 2014. One of these tracks, \"Heartbeat Song\", is an uptempo synthpop track produced by Greg Kurstin. Lyrically, the song sings of meeting a person who restores someone's faith in love. Sonically, USA Today's Brian Mansfeld remarked that the record serves as sonic defibrillator, starting with a jolt of melody, its rhythms shifting a couple times before finally settling into its steady pulse; while Idolator's Bradley Stern described its production as Top 40 radio-friendly and remarked that the track sees Clarkson's pulse raising while falling in love above kicky drums, guitars and hints of synths.\n\"Heartbeat Song\" was written by Mitch Allan, Audra Mae, Kara DioGuardi, and Jason Evigan in a two-day session writing camp. In an interview on Entertainment Tonight, Mae revealed that DioGuardi came up with the main idea and used it as the song's chorus, with everybody else contributing in. After pitching the song to different artists, including Demi Lovato, she later found out during the Christmas season that Clarkson had recorded it and planned to release the song as the album's lead single.\nMusically, the song is written in the key of G-flat major with a fast tempo of 149 beats per minute.  It follows the chord progression G\u266d\u2013B\u266dm7\u2013E\u266dm\u2013C\u266d, and Clarkson's vocals span from G\u266d\u2083 to E\u266d\u2085.\nIn January 2015, Clarkson revealed a set of clues for the single, posting the words \"Proof of life and Dr. Dre #TheNextEpisode (sic)\". On January 7, 2015, she announced January 12, 2015 as its release date as a digital download by RCA Records, followed by a release to Mainstream Top 40 radio stations in the United States on January 13, 2015. A CD single was also issued by RCA's parent company Sony Music Entertainment on March 6, 2015.\n\"Heartbeat Song\" garnered positive reviews from music critics, with Clarkson's return to mainstream pop music lauded, along with her vocals. Billboard's associate editor Jason Lipshutz gave the song 4/5 stars, writing the song's production and vocals sounded invigorated. Reviewing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dylan gave the song a three-and-a-half star rating, describing it as a \"warm, fuzzy snuggle-fest.\" In his midweek review for"

Spanish LGTB website Grupo EGF stated that the rhythm of the recording is \"danceable\", further explaining that it incorporates a \"retro air\" and an \"interesting mix of sounds\". Hitfire saw \"Bop Bop\" as a departure from Inna's previous work. Echoing this thought, the singer confessed in an interview with Romanian radio station Kiss FM that;\nIt is a collaboration with one of my friends from the international music industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys from Play & Win. It is very particular. I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.\nUpon its release, \"Bop Bop\" was met with good reviews from music critics. Jarom\u00edr Koc of Czech music website Musicserver praised Turner's contribution to the song through his \"unusually colored\" voice. While Italian publication R&B Junk's Olivio Umberto found that Inna changed her \"formula\" by not collaborating with a rapper but with another singer, Grupo EGF labelled \"Bop Bop\" as \"contagious\" and \"mature\", further acclaiming Turner's performance. Music website Hitfire wrote that the song's title is \"simple\", and went on praising the refrain and Inna's vocal delivery. The singer herself saw the single as \"cheerful\", \"crazy\" and \"energetic\".\nCommercially, \"Bop Bop\" debuted at number 64 on Romania's Airplay 100 on 26 July 2016, remaining her fourth charting song that week alongside \"Mai stai\" (position 47), \"Diggy Down\" (position 61) and \"We Wanna\" (position 76). Subsequently, the recording moved up 37 places to number 27 on the following week, and reached its peak position at number two on 11 October 2015. The single  also reached number 94 on the Polish Airplay Top 100. Additionally, \"Bop Bop\" was awarded with \"Best Dance-Pop Song\" at the 2015 Radio Rom\u00e2nia Actualit\u0103\u021bi Awards gala, where it was nominated alongside \"C\u00e2nd vremea e rea\" (2015) by Sore and \"Falava\" (2015) by Andra.\n\nThe music video for \"Bop Bop\" was teased on July 9, 2015, featuring a short sequence of Inna and six fellow backup dancer performing synchronized dance moves on a kind of stage or runway. While the dancers were dressed in black and white outfits, the singer sports a sparkling silver top. Three additional videos were released during July 2015 in which the track is played for the first time to unspecified citizens of Los Angeles and Inna's fellow Romanian stars; both videos captured extremely positive input, with some listeners predicting its success. The idea behind the visual was based on Inna's desire to create a \"fashion\" video, for which clothes were procured by"

It was the first track on their debut album, The Stone Roses, and was released as a single. The US release charted at number 18 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart in 1990. In 1991, the single was released in the UK, Germany and Japan featuring previously unreleased B-sides.\n\"I Wanna Be Adored\" begins with a collage of sounds. The first instrument to enter is the bass guitar, which appears 40 seconds in. This is followed by two guitars, one of which plays a pentatonic scale riff. The bass drum enters at 1:13, and the main portion of the song begins at 1:30.\nThe song is performed in the key of G. The song features two main sections: a four bar G\u2013D\u2013G\u2013D\u2013Em chord progression, followed by an eight-bar bridge that shifts from D to C repeatedly. The song's lyrics are minimalist, mainly consisting of the lines \"I don't need to sell my soul/He's already in me\" and the song's title repeated throughout the entire song.\nIn 2006, the music magazine Q voted it 32nd in its list of 100 greatest songs of all time. In May 2007, NME magazine placed I Wanna Be Adored at number 17 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever. VH2 placed the song at number two on the Indie 500, a countdown of their top 500 indie songs of all time. Though There Is a Light That Never Goes Out by the Smiths was at number one, on a condensed version showing just the top 50, the two songs had swapped places, with \"Adored\" at number one. Stylus Magazine also included the song's bassline at number 17 in their 2005 list of the Top 50 Basslines of All Time.\nOasis refer to the Stone Roses by quoting \"I Wanna Be Adored\" in their 1997 song \"Magic Pie\": \"They are sleeping while they dream/ but then they wanna be adored\". The song was also appeared in an episode of American Horror Story: Hotel.\nThe music video for \"I Wanna Be Adored\" was made concurrently with \"Fools Gold\" for the American release of the single in 1989. Hence the videos share similar visual effects and scenery, the respective videos were both filmed near the A57 Snake pass between Sheffield and Manchester, the Inspiral Carpets also used the same place for their video of their song \"This is how it feels.\"\n\n12-inch vinyl (Silvertone 1301-1-JD)\n Cassette (Silvertone 1301-4-JS)\n CD (Silvertone 1301-2-JD)\n\"I Wanna Be Adored\" (edit) \u2013 3:28\n\"I Wanna Be Adored\" \u2013 4:52\n\"Going Down\" \u2013 2:46\n\"Simone\" \u2013 4:24\n7-inch vinyl (Silvertone ORE 31)\n Cassette (Silvertone ORE C 31)\n\"I Wanna Be Adored\" \u2013 3:28\n\"Where Angels Play\" \u2013 4:15\n12-inch vinyl (Silvertone ORE T 31)\n\"I Wanna Be Adored\" \u2013 4:52\n\"Where Angels Play\" \u2013 4:15\n\"Sally Cinnamon\" (Live at the Hacienda) \u2013 3:52\nCD (Silvertone ORE CD 31)\n\"I Wanna Be Adored\" (7\" version) \u2013 3:28\n\"Where Angels Play\" \u2013 4:15\n\"I Wanna Be Adored\" (12\" version) \u2013 4:53\n\"Sally Cinnamon\" (Live at the Hacienda) \u2013 3:52\nCD (Silvertone/Alfa ALCB-392)\n\"I Wanna Be Adored\" (12\" version) \u2013 4:53\n\"Where Angels Play\" \u2013 4:15\n\"Sally Cinnamon\" (Live at the Hacienda) \u2013 3:52\n\"Fools Gold\" (Extended version) \u2013 9:53\n\n\nCover versions of I Wanna Be Adored have been recorded by the following musical groups and artists:\nYear of the Rabbit \u2013 Hunted EP (2003)\nTangerine \u2013 Song for the Now and Others Forever (2004)\nMonsters Are Waiting \u2013 Ones And Zeros EP (2008)\nThe Raveonettes \u2013 as part of Dr. Martens 50th anniversary (2010)\nBadly Drawn Boy \u2013 live\nLana Mir \u2013 Goodbye Girl EP (2010)\nTeron Beal \u2013 Liquor Store (2010)\nEagulls \u2013 as part of The A.V.
