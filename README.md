# AltEntities
Alternative-Entities (AltEntities) is a dataset of English-language alternative questions with their answers. In these questions, a user is presented with a choice of two entities. The user answer intends to select one entity from the pair by referring to it in an indirect way, i.e., without referring to its name or position. For example:

Question: “Do you mean 'Nemesis (Davis novel)' or 'Nemesis (Christie novel)'?”

Answer: “Not the more modern one, the one closer to BC than 2021.”

The entity names are sampled from Wikipedia. The alternative questions are generated using a simple template. The referring expressions are provided by human raters. The dataset contains 6,247 alternative questions in three domains (books, music, and recipes) and 42,529 referring expressions. The dataset is suitable for building machine learning systems to resolve indirect referring expressions for entity selection.
